It was delicious. Only worth $1 though.
--------------------
Want the old diet 7 up back the new has an awlful taste
--------------------
Love Diet 7up! We DON’T even like sugar free 7up. Quite a difference in taste. Bring back Diet 7up! Please.
--------------------
I do not like diet sodas and do not drink them. I actually ENJOY Diet 7 up
--------------------
Why cant I find regular diet 7 up anywhere in the stores ??? I DO NOT want 7 up zero , I see no reason to add a product that just confuses the general public . Just stupid !!!!
--------------------
We like the original diet 7Up, not the new no sugar diet 7 up. I think it must be made with a different sweetener. Please bring back the regular diet 7 up. I am having trouble finding the last bottles in my town!!!!!!
--------------------
I've been loving Diet 7UP for years , but my last 6pack 16.9 oz was just awful. It's as if they forgot to put sweetener in it. I thought it was just my taste buds but my granddaughter gagged on it. I ended up pouring it down the drain. I 'll buy it again but not for a while. Anyone else get a bad batch?
--------------------
I have enjoyed 7Up for many years and this is a smooth drink. My grandchildren are now drinking them and I can see the smile own their faces which lets me know they enjoy the taste.
--------------------
This soda goes beyond all of my expectations! Esp. for a diet soda! I LOVE the regular 7 up too, but my favorite is the diet! Exceptional taste!!!
--------------------
Diet 7-UP has a one of a kind taste the best soft drink
--------------------
When you can find them. Why is everyone suddenly out of them?
--------------------
I have adored 7up since a child. More so as an adult. The flavor peaks at its open and lasts even when warmed. I cannot compare to other lemon lime drinks, as they have not the caliber of this beverage.
--------------------
This the best drink on the market to me it's has no dye in it and no caffeine and low sodium and it has only one hundred forty calories. It has zero fat but what I LOVE about this product it's so smooth and refreshing.
--------------------
Excellent in quenching your thirst on a very warm day
--------------------
Great taste. Very refreshing! No sugar no caffine!!
--------------------
Love this diet soda. Doesn't leave you with a nasty after taste and IS refreshing!!
--------------------
Goes great with anything mix it drink alone love the taste I cook with it I don't buy anything eles
--------------------
strawberry 7UP is Great i love my caffine free drink
--------------------
Use to drink a 6 pack a day - am down to 3 a day - only pop that I want to drink - it is hard to find Diet 7up in large chain gas stations my only complaint
--------------------
Its very great product to to use for diet to and it teasr is so good use it and u will not regret it
--------------------
Love love looooove this product! Great quality and awesome price! It works so well!!! Highly recommend!
--------------------
This is one of my favorite drink, you can taste the ginger and it’s not and overbearing taste. It’s just the perfect drink in my opinion.
--------------------
When I have a tummy ache and cant get my hands on some ginger; I pick up some ginger sprite. The color of the can is cute and it keeps it's original sprite theme.
--------------------
People either seem to love or hate this. It’s my favorite Sprite EVER because I’m a fan of ginger. The ginger isn’t overwhelming and takes away a little of the over-sweetness of regular Sprite. Buy it when you see it because it’s limited (according to a distributor I talked to) and getting very hard to find now.
--------------------
Omg where have you been all my life, my two favorite flavors all in one!! It was refreshing, clean citrusy and the Ginger gave it a good kick!! I loved it
--------------------
Ok. I thought this would taste like ginger ale. This Sprite is nothing like ginger ale. It tastes like a Sprite that someone dumped a WHOLE BUNCH of ginger into. I can't decide whether or not I like it or hate it. Either way, I'm probably not going to purchase it again.
--------------------
I like the taste, something different. My husband hates it
--------------------
great ginger lemon lime taste
--------------------
This sprite is sooooo good. My sister in law got some the other day. Im in love. Im usually a vanilla sprite kind of girl but it so nice. Im going to get a few bottles to store.
--------------------
So I am a huge ginger ale fan and was hoping for a similar taste but the sprite ginger didn’t hit the mark with me. If you like a strong raw ginger taste then you will like this but if you are looking for something like ginger ale I would recommend sticking to the other.
--------------------
Ew! Can not believe how unsatisfying this drink was. I love ginger and was expecting to taste it and that it would be strong. It’s barely a hint of ginger in it. Tastes just like regular sprite to me
--------------------
Surprised to see this in stores! The classic label of sprite I could only taste the ginger for a second with each sip.
--------------------
I am a big fan of sprite and ginger ale. I was very excited when I found out about this new soda.. but I was honestly not impressed. the ginger flavor was not very strong. It tasted a lot like the original sprite to me.
--------------------
Alright, I bought this on an impulse COVID-19 buy. With hopes of it not being nasty and I’ll have to stay home drink gross pop! Lol I actually like this a lot! BUT you have to appreciate real ginger taste( although it may be artificial) it resembles Gin Gin’s flavor. Crisp like original Sprite, refreshing like real ginger.
--------------------
I love Sprite Zero it is one of my all time favorite drinks. It's not too sweet or carbonated and now that they have added ginger to it I think it's better than any other product. I tied it as soon as it came out this year and would highly recommend it.
--------------------
Ummmm ....this is the best sprite ever ..... it kinda tastes like ginger ale but not haha if that makes sense and the ginger doesn’t hit you until after you drink it ... but nothing compares to a regular ice cold sprite !!!!
--------------------
Well, this is different! It’s definitely Sprite but there is a little hint of ginger that gives it a unique flavor. Not overpowering but just about the right amount to let you know it’s in there. Sometimes I get tired of the same old colas over and over so if you’re like me and are looking for something very unique, give this a try.
--------------------
Puppy Monkey Baby..that's all I can think of when I think Kickstart and there are some things you cannot unsee. Kickstart is a good drink though..nice alternative to Dew
--------------------
Love this new addition with no fake sugar!!
--------------------
Diet Dr. Pepper makes the whole dang world taste better. :)
--------------------
Fiancé loves Pepsi so glad target has great deals
--------------------
Pepsi is the worst, Coca Cola taste way better.
--------------------
I love this product Pepsi is my only go to soda it gives me the sugar I need to get through the day and whenever you have a pizza to wash it down with you Gotta have a Pepsi￼
--------------------
Gives me my soda fix without going overboard.
--------------------
Something tasted off about the pack I received. I tried two cans and it kinda tasted off/flat. I love pepsi but I think I got a bad batch.
--------------------
Good price, tastes great no issues
--------------------
Product is great, I purchase with the intention to take advantage of their promotion (buy 2 get 1 free) it so be that 2 of my 12 packs were “unavailable” so I’m stuck with a $5 pack of sodas that I could of bought for much less. This pick up now feature needs to add a suplemento choice.
--------------------
Listed online as cans in the title and description but this is for the small bottles as shown in the photo
--------------------
These are small bottles that are easy to put in your adult-sized lunchbox
--------------------
Classic flavor that comes in a much better portion size for lunchboxes and while you're travelling
--------------------
Pepsi Classic. You can't go wrong with the blue. My favorite soda
--------------------
Pepsi is classic. It's what I drank growing up...and now much more so in moderation, but this remains my go-to for the classic cola.
--------------------
Orangey goodness is your mouth! Not much of a citrus person but this is a delicious drink to quench your thirst
--------------------
Not my favorite orange soda to reach for! It doesn't have that bite and crispness I look for in an orange soda. Sunkist is my favorite hands down but when on a craving for some orange soda, a Fanta will suffice.
--------------------
Love getting this pop for a birthday party. So tasty and its the best orange pop on the market!
--------------------
I enjoy the flavor of Fanta Orange as its very tasty. Its also refreshing as well. I do prefer Orange Crush over Fanta but will still drink Fanta.
--------------------
Fanta is the only orange soda Ill drink. Theres something about it that sets it apart from other brands.
--------------------
Little orangey taste but still good. Would get once in a while. Thay need to make it more fruity flavored than more fuzzy.
--------------------
I normally don't get fanta but it tastes great. Their commercial is cute. The pop is caffeine free. So if you want to wake up this won't help.
--------------------
Love this soda it's one of my favorites and I was the best one of them all nice packaging better cold just overall good
--------------------
Fresh and delicious but a little bit expensive. Great flavor, my favorite soda so far.British Orange Fanta Soda 6 Pack Of 330Ml Cans
--------------------
Good nice taste good amount of soda doesnt taste bad drinking some this moment is my favorite soda
--------------------
Love a good Fanta! Nice flavour and quenches thirst! Good as a sometimes food- due to high sugar content in all sodas.
--------------------
It taste so good . These are so good for party’s and occasions. I recommend this drink.
--------------------
I drink this all the time people love it so much it is an amazing taste really cheap if you add ice it’s very refreshing would definitely buy again it’s very affordable and it’s amazing like All I ever do is drink this so buy it it’s amazing
--------------------
I have always loved orange Fanta. I don’t drink it very often anymore because it isn’t healthy, but it tastes so good!
--------------------
I absolutely love orange soda and this one is perfect. Plus, when you mix it with the Fanta peach it’s even better￼￼
--------------------
This pop is definitely the one pop that I absolutely love and I won’t stop drinking and it’s caffeine free. I like it a lot.
--------------------
I have always liked orange soda beginning with the Bireleys brand. They disappeared from the grocery and supermarket shelves so I began buying generic orange soda. Last year I began buying the 2 liter bottles of orange soda. I bought Crush, Sunkist, and Fanta. I tried Crush for one week, Sunkist for one week, and finally Fanta for one week. Of the three orange sodas, Fanta is my favorite. Fanta has a smooth taste with the right amount of orange flavor and doesn't go flat.I buy the 2 liter bottles of Fanta every week now. I only drink orange soda from a glass bottle so I bought a 4 pack of Fanta Orange in the bottles. I drank all the soda and washed the bottles in hot water. These bottles are placed in the refrigerator for future use. Every day I pour Fanta Orange from the 2 liter bottles into the glass bottles. There is something about drinking sodas from glass bottles. I don't drink sodas from the cans because I don't like the metallic taste.
--------------------
It’s good. It definitely has bubbles though. If you don’t like texture.. etc, you won’t like this. It does have a good orange flavor too.
--------------------
Who doesn’t like Fanta?! For someone who doesn’t drink pop, I’m addicted to this stuff!!
--------------------
I’m not sure why but this brand of Orange dis taste way different to me than any other brands. It’s like more bitter or something I don’t know exactly what it is but something makes this brand specifically taste “off”
--------------------
Fanta orange will always be a favorite..it's delicious and refreshing! It's caffeine free, but there's about 40g of sugar in a 12 fl oz can so it's not an all the time drink.
--------------------
This has to be one of my favorite drinks when eating a meal because it’s just so sweet and bubbly. It tastes great without feeling too sickly afterwards. I would 10/10 recommend this for anyone!! Fanta Orange Soda Soft Drink
--------------------
I get this sometimes . It smells and taste like orange flavor. Taste really good.but gets flat quickly.
--------------------
Lately this has been my go to when I have soda. I love the orange flavor and love that it doesn’t have any caffeine in it.
--------------------
You cannot go wrong with an orange Fanta. I can have it straight, I can mix it with some sprite, doesn’t matter. There’s nothing bad I can really say about it, besides the fact that it’s not healthy, but no soda’s healthy.
--------------------
If you’re looking for a refreshing fruit flavored drink. It’s gotta be Fanta orange soda. It is the best for its taste and how smooth it goes does. It by far was better than any expectation. Time to get another!!
--------------------
All of the Fanta flavors are amazing but Orange is no doubt my favorite flavor! I love grape and strawberry as well! Though they have a lot of sugar, that’s kind of what you’re asking for when you get drinks like these. Love them!
--------------------
Tastes amazing. If you throw this in the blender with some vanilla ice cream it’s (Fanta)stic.
--------------------
Fanta is a good soda brand but personally I just don’t like orange flavored anything. It’s nothing against Fanta. I just prefer other flavors. The drink itself was obviously a good quality one, considering it’s part of the Coca-cola company.
--------------------
When I want to cheat on trying to be healthy I find myself diving into Fanta Orange soda. Fanta has the ability to taste great cold or at room temperature. That is very rare to find in carbohydrates drinks. The mini cans are my favorite the only problem is one tends to lead into two, but my craving does get satisfied.
--------------------
So refreshing! As well it helps that it isn’t a dark drink that tend to stain your teeth over time. As well, this brings back the 90s with orange soda if anyone gets the hint I am going for! I recommend having if your looking for a soda.
--------------------
As a diabetic I really love this soda. When I was diagnosed and informed that the only soda I should drink moving forward was diet I was a bit saddened because I thought I wouldn't be able to drink fanta anymore. When I found fanta zero I was super happy because I could once again enjoy one of my favorite sodas. The taste is great.
--------------------
Totally my guilty pleasure. It’s awful but I could drink this stuff all day like it was water. I may have an addiction.
--------------------
It’s definitely good but we try to drink soda with real@sugar only now. So we don’t purchase it anymore
--------------------
This soda takes me back in my high school years! I love the rent a soda because it tastes like orange and has refreshing after taste. Sometimes I put it in me orange cake to make it more fluffy and more "orangy"! I recommend it to everyone who wants a tasty soda!
--------------------
I love this soda because it's my favorite flavor. It met all my expectations of what a soda should taste like.
--------------------
Tastes sooo good, and I dont like colored drinks. But it always hits the spot, great value, great packaging.
--------------------
Besides Kel loving orange soda, (sorry not sorry) I love it as well. This is a great tasting soda that's caffeine free so as a pregnant woman it made me feel a little better consuming it. Don't get me wrong it still has a ton of sugar! However drinking one 16.9 oz bottle throughout the day is definitely working for me!
--------------------
I find this orange soda pretty tasty. I dont drink orange soda much but when I get thirsty for one I would choose this one. And it's reasonable price for it too!!
--------------------
Looooooooove. My favorite soda ever. Perfectly refreshing for summer! Ice cold orange soda is the best.
--------------------
Fanta is my favorite i am not a huge fan of sunkist or anything but the orange is my favorite flavor of fanta
--------------------
Fanta soda what can i say the best for me. I enjoy drink a fanta with my food. I rather get a fanta then a pepsi or coca-cola.
--------------------
If I chose to drink orange soda then I’m definitely going with a FANTA. The price isn’t bad, the drink is satisfactory and there’s nothing that could make it better. Easily found in a can or bottle to recap.
--------------------
I love fanta, my absolute favourite drink for summers. I love everything made with oranges or orange flavour in summers. This tastes so good and tangy. Perfect way to beat the heat. I always keep extra stock in my fridge. I can't live without it. It has many other flavours too
--------------------
I only drink sofa IF once a year and never a full can but as a child this was such a treat for me and I absolutely loved it. I never liked Coke but Fanta Orange soda was like a gift from heaven for me. It was so delicious going down on a super hot day. I remember it vividly as a childhood memory.
--------------------
This is my favorite orange soda. It tastes so good cold. It taste good from a fountain, can, plastic and glass bottle.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite choices of orange sodas. I don’t have it often but sometimes will get a bottle or two at the store when checking out. Super sugary but aside from that its a pretty good flavor.
--------------------
It’s my favorite soda, one of the good thing is Cowan’s have caffeine so I could drink when I was pregnant I can said it’s more healthy than the other ones
--------------------
I love Fanta Orange because it has a sweet taste to it, it is what I always get from the vending machine when i am craving soda at work and it is very refreshing.
--------------------
This is one of the best pops out there. Tastes amazing and is always refreshing. Perfect for anytime of the day.
--------------------
This is my all time favorite soda. Im not a big caffeine person so I love getting this. Nothing is better than an iced cold orange Fanta. I like this compared to all the other brands.
--------------------
My absolute favorite pop ever. It’s the best Fanta flavor and it’s awesome that they make it in Zero calories. I always have to have Fanta zero when I go to the movies, it just makes it that much better
--------------------
My favorite soda to have when I go out! Started liking it since middle school and still do! I drink other flavors, but this one is by far the best!
--------------------
I love this soda! It always has the perfect sweetness to it and tastes refreshing. The packaging is normal. Nothing special. Just orange bottle. I buy this once in a while when I'm craving soda.
--------------------
Orange soda used to be my favorite but as I have gotten older I try to slow down on the soda and candy. This is still a good flavor I just don't drink it anymore.
--------------------
I love the Fanta from Mexico it just taste better for some reason and that’s all I drink when I go over there!!
--------------------
Fizzy, sweet, goodness with every gulp! Full of flavor and no caffeine! My new favorite soda!
--------------------
I love to drink Fanta Orange Soda Soft Drink it taste really good. I drink it Since my middle school. It is a good value and affordable price. Yes it met my expectations. I would recommend it and will buy again and again z
--------------------
Whenever I go to a gas station or grab chinese food I ike to compiment my meal or plain thirst with a ice cold can of orange fanta I love Orange soda and fanta is my go to first
--------------------
This it's my sons favorite drink, I like it because there isn't any caffenie. And I can usually find it anywhere for a good price.
--------------------
Love this soda. Like the orange flavor and strawberry too. Pretty good for not having caffeine. If u want to avoid bad soda, you ahould try soda with no caffeine, it helps alot.
--------------------
Sometimes I want a caffeine free, fruity drink and this hits the spot. Fanta is so good!! My kids think it's a special occasion when I bring this home and allow them to drink it, lol.
--------------------
Bold or zero sugar. I don't like them. Are you discontinuing diet???I hope not. Thank You. Please advise if you can.
--------------------
Ginger ale is a great soda flavor, and Canada Dry is probably my favorite brand for it. This is a soda that feels more refreshing than overly sweet, and when I want soda it can be a better option than some of the too sugary ones.
--------------------
This ginger ale has been my hero through hospitalization and chemo! I was so grateful to UWMC and SCCA for carrying name brand ginger ale and having diet readily available for those of us that cant handle sugar. I buy it regularly in the 2liters for home and LOVE adding lime.
--------------------
Great flavor. Perfect for low cal mules and other drinks. Great on meats too to ad flavor.
--------------------
I am trying to find out if the diet ginger ale has sugar and how much
--------------------
I've been buying Mott's Apple White Grape Juice for years for myself and granddaughters-this is so delicious! Try it, you won't be sorry.
--------------------
Wasnt expecting to like the flavor of a diet ginger ale but was happy with it the taste is great
--------------------
I hardly ever buy juice for my kids but when I do Im very picky on the brand. The kids love Motts
--------------------
It is a product to analyze because it changes a bit to know, I recommend using it probarlo
--------------------
I love anything apple or grapes and when I can have it as a drink its even better. My hubby doesnt really understand the love I have for it but its okay, I tend to overbuy and results into not having enough space to store my juices. Hubby bought a wine and cider kit so he can experiment with the extra bottles we have in to car. At least were both using it!
--------------------
It tastes like bad medicine. Not good! If your going to buy apple juice, just stick with the original.
--------------------
This is the only juice that my four kids will drink. Usually keep some on hand, they even like it watered down some.
--------------------
That white apple is amazing it tastes amazing with some white mozzarella sticks i swear to god amazing. And its so sweet and pure.
--------------------
Great for lunch. Its a little on the sweet side so I always mix with water but thats ok it lasts longer
--------------------
Love how this taste just like the original but it is diet! Very Refreshing and delicious!
--------------------
I've loved this since I remember. So refreshing when nearly frozen cold on hot summer days. So revitalizing when cool/warm during those yucky days when I'm ill. Looking for it everywhere now!?
--------------------
Love to mix this in my alcoholic drinks on a Friday night! I also like to add a little bit of cherry flavoring and it’s amazing. I would like for them to come out with more flavors. I would definitely keep on buying this soda.
--------------------
I buy six packs in the bottles approx four six packs at a time and have for over a year only this time the ones I purchased are flat and I can not drink them......
--------------------
I love the diet Canada Dry ginger ale because even though it’s diet I can’t tell the difference and ginger is great for upset stomachs!
--------------------
Family's drink every meal we have... The taste is oozing and taste so good. We tried different flavor and this is the best flavor for us....
--------------------
Just as delicious as the non-diet kind! I love this stuff! Try mixing it with some watermelon juice! So good!
--------------------
Great flavor. Helps when my stomach is upset or I am feeling nauseous. Like the diet option for less sugar.
--------------------
It's so yummy and refreshing, it's caffeine free and you can drink it without regrets since it has 0 calories.its
--------------------
I recently discovered my love for Canada Dry. When flying I get slightly queasy so started drinking this and have actually started loving it. I keep it as a staple in the house. It’s not over priced and it taste great. It’s even better mixed with bourbon.
--------------------
This is my favorite for when I want something refreshing but don’t want the caffeine. It also is great for upset stomachs.
--------------------
I personally think the diet ginger ale tastes so much better than the regular ginger ale. It has such a nice gingery taste and is super refreshing. I literally drink this almost every day to help settle my stomach.
--------------------
This has been my lock down spring/summer drink, I gave up pop several years ago, recently wanting a fizzy drink loving ginger this fit the bill, it's refreshing and also makes a great mixer with an adult alcohol beverage, reminds me of my favorite drink Moscow mule and some vodka and a little mint it's even better.
--------------------
Though diet, it has a good quench of thirst with first sip. Balanced ginger flavor without feeling too “chemical””
--------------------
I have been using this product for years, little by little the original taste has been disappearing finally the last case I bought had done it!!! The taste has gone, more a citrus acid taste then the ginger I expect. I don't know what is going on, but someone in TX is playing games with the formulation! it's to a point I'm giving you 1 more try! UPC 07800014842 ... L1159
--------------------
Super delicious drink! It’s great to have when you aren’t feeling the best, or just want a light color soda. I’ve been dieting so it’s perfect to have!
--------------------
The fulfilling, crispy, slightly zingy flavor delights the tastebuds. Whether you have tummy troubles or need a not-too-sweet drink to quench your parched thirst, Diet Canada Dry Ginger Ale will cover just about every need you have, including your need to stay on track calorie wise.
--------------------
I love this juice and so do my kids. It’s delicious and very nutritious. DEFINITELY A WIN WIN! I would absolutely recommend.
--------------------
The best ginger ale- I love it! So good!!! I always drink this at home. My family loves it!
--------------------
My house is always stocked with diet ginger ale. I’ve had times when I have to buy another brand, and it is not the same. The taste of Canada Dry is so crisp and balanced. The flavor is never overpowering.
--------------------
This is the only diet soda that I not only tolerate but love. My kids like it to so it’s a treat for the whole family.
--------------------
Brought 2 six packs of the diet ginger ale and noticed that it has 5 calories. 2353 sep 0920 jx1
--------------------
Canada Dry has such a refreshing, sharp, clean taste- unlike colas or many other soft drinks; & the diet has no weird after taste at all like most diet drinks! I love it!
--------------------
Canadry dru is my preferred brand of ginger ale. Has a bold flavor and is very refreshing
--------------------
It’s not bad but not my favorite soda...I try to avoid soda with sugar and tried this Diet Ginger Ale but I still prefer Coca-Cola Zero sugar!
--------------------
A dependable great taste even without the sugar. Still crisp and refreshing. Almost the same as the original
--------------------
This brand's ginger ale is very good. It is expensive compared to other brands and isn’t a good value overall. It is equal to other, less costly brands, and I usually buy those. I would buy it if less expensive brands are unavailable. I recommend trying it.
--------------------
This is, by far, my favorite brand of diet ginger ale. I’m not even a fan of sodas, but this just has a wonderful flavor. Other brands of diet ginger ale have a weak flavor. Some taste artificial. Canada Dry has a strong flavor that stands up to a little melted ice, even. I highly recommend it.
--------------------
I love mott's 100% apple white grape juice. It makes regular apple juice taste better and sweet with a hint of grape. I can't go back to regular apple juice! I would definitely repurchase this.
--------------------
Best ginger ale ever, great taste! Greetings from switzerland!
--------------------
Love this for my sugar free diet. Doesn’t quite taste like the original ginger ale but it okay
--------------------
Motts Apple White Grape Juice- I love this juice! This was my first time trying the drink and it tastes amazing!! I wouldn’t say there’s a way to improve the drink because it tastes good!! I would repurchase!
--------------------
I call this my medicine! Because I gave up soda for 2019 new year and haven’t drank it since. EXCEPT Canada Dry diet ginger ale! It’s my absolute favorite and definitely helps soothe a hurting tummy! Sponsor me Canada Dry
--------------------
Sweet baby Jesus. These are so good. I can’t get enough. Not syrupy like the other sodas are. Taste is so refreshing it will have you coming back to crack open another can!
--------------------
I don’t like pop usually but I always make an exception for ginger ale any day. I like this because it’s 0 calories and I don’t believe you compromise the crisp flavor.
--------------------
refreshing never fails, I always look for it when I go to super the whole family we like
--------------------
I love the diet ginger ale. I do not like to add extra sugar in anything. And this tastes amazing. By itself, or mixed with vodka and a fresh lime.
--------------------
We love the diet Canada Dry ginger ale However, we are Unable to find it anywhere during the pandemic. We have been to Many , many. stores. Any suggestions? Oxford Michigan
--------------------
I love the regular apple juice, so I decided to try this one. The flavor is good and it’s not as sweet as I wanted it too be but still good. The packaging is easy to open.
--------------------
Canada Dry diet Ginger Ale has great flavor. Often diet ginger ale doesn’t have the same ginger taste as regular soda but Canada Dry does not disappoint.
--------------------
Love this drink. It tastes just as good as non diet but without the extra calories. I wouldn’t change a thing.
--------------------
If I’m grabbing a soda, I’m always going to try to grab a diet one. And Canada Dry Diet Ginger Ale is really yummy! It’s great on its own or as a mixer. I personally don’t mind diet sodas, however I know some don’t like the difference in taste to the original counterparts.
--------------------
My new favorite drink! It’s light and taste refreshing! It’s also a great mixer, especially with bourbon
--------------------
Good product , but very hard to find in the stores in 16oz bottles. we don't like cans, if I could find this without trip after trip to the store i would rate it higher.
--------------------
When I'm not well, I buy ginger ale. I'm going to choose the cheapest option out of the name brand ginger ales. Ginger ale has helped settle my tummy since I was little abd had been sick and home from school. My mom would pour ginger ale into a cup and either stir to get rid of bubbles (carbon dioxide) or let it sit out and go 'flat'. Either way, ginger ale has been a "life saver" for my children and I over the years. My kiddos won't drink ginger tea but they will tear up some ginger ale!
--------------------
I love ginger ale! Great when you are not feeling great and your stomach needs some settling down
--------------------
Yummy and refreshing! It also makes a good punch if you add fruit juice and fruit to it.
--------------------
I love this when I have a stomach ache or when I need something carbonated. Great taste and better with lime
--------------------
I really enjoy ginger ale and this is my favorite brand. I especially like the diet ginger ale it leaves no aftertaste and it tastes just like the regular ginger ale to me it's crisp and refreshing and I really enjoy it. I would definitely buy it again
--------------------
Love me some Canada Dry, especially if it’s diet! This stuff is so good and tastes just like the regular Canada Dry.
--------------------
Really good good taste good price good package love this product I recommend this product
--------------------
Canada Dry is one of the better ginger ales on the market and whenever I was sick as a kid it’s what i would get to drink. I love the taste of it and even if ginger ale doesn’t actually help when sick i keep using it for the placebo effect lol
--------------------
One of my favorite drinks! After finding out I was intolerant to sugar I was so sad that I would be giving up my ginger ale but then I saw they have a diet version that literally saved my life! They are so fresh and delicious and great for any time or occasion
--------------------
This is my favorite soda to drink. I try to only drink a glass a day with dinner, but it is light and sweet.
--------------------
I use not like this bc it had no sugar and I use to drinking the regular one. Once I started watching my weight and sugar I went back to this and love it. Whenever I have upset stomach or need a soda this is my go too! I’ll never go back to regular
--------------------
This is my favorite ginger ale, and I won’t buy any other brand. It is the perfect balance of spicy ginger and sweet. It does not have too much of a fake sugar diet taste. I love it for cocktails and just drinking on its own.
--------------------
Love this drink when I’m sick and on regular days. One of the only drinks that are also good when they’re not cold as well.
--------------------
Great for being on keto when you have that occasional soda craving! Tastes perfectly sweet and the flavor is spot on to normal Gingerale
--------------------
I love this drink. I also love the fact I can buy it in the diet soda form. I also keep this around for when anyone gets sick because it is flavor that keeps them hydrated. It mixes well for cocktails if any of the grown ups want it.
--------------------
Great for mixing with alcohol for low calorie cocktails. So glad they made a diet version.
--------------------
Diet ginger ale is the only soda I drink. This beverage has a great taste with no added sugar. It is perfect for when you need to calm your stomach or over ice on a nice warm day. It is very affordable and relatively healthy compared to other soda options
--------------------
Love the taste and how smooth it goes down! Great for me when my blood sugar levels are too low great sugar booster
--------------------
Love this for keto ! It tastes delicious and can be used in cake mixes as well . So happy to have the diet version !
--------------------
This was my go to drink for nausea during pregnancy. The carbonation helped me feel a little less nauseous. Canada Dry is the best tasting ginger ale
--------------------
I have been switching to diet ginger ale lately as a healthier alternative to regular ginger ale. I have to say I can definitely taste the difference, but still a decent drink
--------------------
I love diet ginger ale and buy lots of the diet Ginger ale! I have noticed lately that some of The diet ginger ale taste flat and also noted That when a container does taste flat the Container does not have on the side of bottle Made with real ginger! I do hope I can continue To find “made with real ginger” on the container! Thanks!
--------------------
I am a big fan of Canada Dry Diet Ginger Ale. I always keep some in my house. It is affordable and a great staple to have for any occasion, from mixed drinks to stomach aches. It has a great flavor and I will continue to be a repeat customer and recommend this product.
--------------------
Diet Ginger Ale is the best!! So refreshing. I've been drinking it for a couple of years now. I always keep two 12 packs in the fridge at all times. It's the best cold straight from the can.
--------------------
Recently I've been cutting back on meat (mostly beef and pork) because I've been getting an upset stomach constantly. We picked up a 12 pack of this to help settle my stomach and now I'm addicted again! I think ginger ale as a soda is vastly underrated. I am admittedly a diet soda lover and this will be a staple in our house again when I want something naughty
--------------------
I've been drinking ginger ale since I was 5 yrs old. Mother would always give to us anytime we had an upset stomach. Great for 51 years!
--------------------
not as flavorful as the original, but for a diet soda, it’s not bad! would rather drink the regular kind but being healthier isn’t always the tastiest
--------------------
This is a pretty decent product for ginger ale. Plus, it is diet. So, it has 0 calories. The only drawback I can think of is that it has 0 caffeine. I prefer a kick with my sodas.
--------------------
I love ginger ale but typically only drink diet drinks so this is my go to. I’ve tried other diet brands of ginger ale and didn’t like them so I would definitely choose this brand over the others if you want diet ginger ale.
--------------------
A staple in our house! We love this soda so much and use it as a mixer or just drink it alone
--------------------
This is great like the original Canada Dry except it’s healthier so I go for this one
--------------------
The taste of this sweet blend of juices gently taps upon my taste buds like the goddess of dance. However the packaging greatly diminishes the potential of this exquisite concoction. I believe the problem stems from the fact that the straw is pathetically weak and cannot perform its job! Many a time I have been left with a pouch half full, with the other half on the floor or on my shirt! I CAN NOT in good faith recommend this product to a friend, and I have not. Change the design of the pouch or increase straw strength and I may reconsider my recommendation and overall rating.
--------------------
Canada dry Ginger ale is my favorite ginger ale and I’ve been drinking out since I was a young child. I find that Canada dry Ginger ale has a stronger ginger flavor than any other brand and it never seems to disappoint my taste buds.
--------------------
The only thing that settles my stomach when I’m not feeling well. Doesn’t taste like a ‘diet’ drink at all. The only downside is that it gives me heartburn if I drink it on an empty stomach.
--------------------
Very crispy taste. It’s refreshing & affordable. I enjoy this drink very much. I usually get this on my flights!
--------------------
This is kinda like Diet Coke to me, in that sometimes you need the diet and sometimes you’d prefer to have sugar. It’s great for a delicate system. Ginger calms down an upset stomach so this is pretty easy to get down.
--------------------
I use frozen Strawberries in my Diet Ginger Ale and it is Heavenly! I recommend giving it a try!
--------------------
I grew up with governors. But never a favorite. So when I discovered Canada dry, I was impressed. Not overly dry a pleasant ginger flavor the perfect amount of "fizz". Works great to settle the stomach or just to sip on a hot day.
--------------------
I buy this almost every week prices are crazy in my area. I wish I could find coupons for it. I love the flavor!
--------------------
One of my favorite juice items to buy when I grocery shop. The taste is consistently amazing but the price is a tad bit expensive for the amount of product you get. I’d definitely recommend for others though I wouldn’t be sharing mine lol.
--------------------
This is juice has a all natural taste and makes me so happy!!!!!
--------------------
I love canada dry ginger ale, it's the only kind I buy. The only kind of ginger ale that doesn't go flat as soon as you open it!
--------------------
I am obsessed with it!!
--------------------
Great size, try them!
--------------------
Bought these for a family gathering and i should have gotten more, these were gone before i realized them. Seems like people prefer the mini's to the regular cans or even using cups. especially with social distancing measures.
--------------------
Perfect size! I used to always waste part of a regular can of Pepsi, not anymore!
--------------------
Just the right size no more wasting soda
--------------------
I will drink Pepsi Max any day since I like it just as much as its competitors zero sugar soda.
--------------------
I have grown up drinking Diet Pepsi, but as soon as Pepsi Max, and then Pepsi Zero, was available, I switched to the new brand. It's a classic & refreshing drink that reminds me of fond times as I was growing up. For example, my father would take me to a small general store where we'd each get an ice-cold diet Pepsi from an old-time freezer. Before we drank it, we would always put in some red-skinned peanuts, which would give our drink a wonderful sweet & salty flavor. Some of the favorite times I spent with my father, drinking one of my favorite ice-cold drinks - it doesn't get any better than that!!
--------------------
Classic flavor that comes in a much better portion size for lunchboxes and while you're travelling
--------------------
Zero Sugar? I'll take it. Good to see the rebranding of Pepsi Max
--------------------
I love cherry coke. It is one of my most favorite sodas. Just simply has a really good flavor
--------------------
This one is one of my faves. I like it better than just normal coke itself. It gives a good flavor.
--------------------
Yummm i love coca cola cherry it is def in my top 3 soda flavors! Anytime this is available in a fountain kn a restaurant this is my pick the flavor is just the perfect combination !
--------------------
This is my favorite. I Can definitely taste the cherry and it gives it a good taste. When I crave a soda this is what I drink.
--------------------
Anything with cherry is good in it! It has such a rich flavor in it, it’s hard to not miss the cherry flavor in it.
--------------------
The taste is similar to Dr. Pepper. Obviously a little different though. I love the fizz.
--------------------
A great soda. It has great flavor, usually affordable although some stores seem to be quite overpriced. A great mixer or drink by itself.
--------------------
Always gets this when we go watch movie. Cant explain how good it is but i really love it. Not much fuzz on it which is i like. Not to sweet bit really good.
--------------------
Everytime I have a cherry coke I’m taken back to being a teenager at the AMC movie theater. It’s sweat but not overwhelming
--------------------
Very delicious! I love the light taste of cherry while enjoying my fav soda. Perfect drink paired with a burger and fries
--------------------
Super delicious with a nice meal at home. You can never go wrong with this flavor. My spouse is addicted he literally drinks coke with almost every meal
--------------------
I love cherry Coke I couldn’t find the exact one but I like the 90 cal small can I get a headache now if I don’t drink it in the morning
--------------------
Coke is better than Pepsi and cherry coke is better than non-cherry (or regular) Coke but not better than Diet Coke or it’s children
--------------------
Our whole house looooves their cherry coke! Only kind of pop we buy and can’t live without! Such a yummy cherry flavor!
--------------------
Love a cherry coke! I do prefer flavor of cherry Pepsi to cherry coke but I still wouldn’t turn one down. A classic and loved beverage.
--------------------
One of the superior flavors of Coke. I don’t even know what it is about the cherry flavor that makes it taste even better, but it does.
--------------------
I know soda isn’t the best but this is my go to soda. I could drink it every day. I love that the cherry syrup isn’t too strong but perfect
--------------------
I like this flavor a lot. Sometimes you want something a little different than regular soda and this hits the spot for me.
--------------------
CAN CHERRY COKE IS BETTER. Fountain is next, and then bottled. That’s the only opinion that’s correct. Tastes amazing. 10/10
--------------------
I love this soda. It has such a crisp,carbonated cherry flavorful taste. It is also refreshing and easy to find in stores.
--------------------
I love all Coca Cola so much! I wish I didn’t because if the high calories, but I do! The price keeps going up, though.
--------------------
If I had to pick between classic coke and cherry, I would pick cherry 100%. I love the flavor combination! It's just sweet enough for my liking and it's cheap.
--------------------
Now Cherry Coke that's the best cocottes and came up it's not that strong not Coke is strong but I like it too but have to watch myself when I drink those
--------------------
The best mix of coca-cola and cherries! It’s delicious and met all of my expectations.
--------------------
The husband really love the cherry flavored Coca Cola. It’s his favorite. I used to drink it but no longer can drink soda.
--------------------
I don't like regular coke taste so the cherry in it really tones it down, it makes it the perfect mixture. It has that kick from coke but not the overwhelming taste!
--------------------
one of my favorite sodas to have with a meal. very refreshing and satisfying to the tongue
--------------------
Delicious cherry taste with that amazing coke taste !!it was Been a favorite for years !! Different logos / branding but same delicious taste !!!!!!
--------------------
I’m a big cherry coke person. I feel like cherry is such a perfect complement to the sweet, strong flavor of coke. I don’t drink soda very often as I find it can often be too sweet for me, but when I do I go for this flavor of coke.
--------------------
I’m not into cherry drinks but this one cleans the palette nicely! Not too overpowering with cherry flavor!
--------------------
This soda is super delicious and is one of my absolute favorites. The cost is affordable and the flavor has not been changed over the years either.
--------------------
I don't really drink pop that much besides Faygo but if I do Coke Cola is my go-to. I used to be a Pepsi fan but ever since I switch to Coke I don't feel like I get a headache everytime I drink it.
--------------------
Cherry coke is an original favorite of mine. It tastes so good when served icy cold on a hot day.
--------------------
My all time favorite soda. I always will pick this in the grocery￼ store out of all the options I get to pick from. This have just enough cherry tase so it doesn’t tase like cough syrup and it brings out the Coca Cola flavor.￼
--------------------
Best can drink i have had really good and so nice cold and fresh and i always get them when i go on break for work. Makes my day better having a good tasting drink and it meet all my expectations. I will be buying more of this lovely soda and i recommend this to call
--------------------
I mean, it’s wonderful. And I love it. HOWEVER, I would never suggest someone start drinking soda. It is pretty addictive and it’s been a huge struggle of mine it comes to me trying to be healthier. My eating habits could be perfect and I’ll still only want to drink coke. It’s madness.
--------------------
If I’m reaching for a soda or going to the cooler at a gas station, I’m looking for a Cherry Coke.
--------------------
Coca-Cola Cherry is my favorite flavor of soda of all time and obviously this is just the regular company bottle and it’s so delicious. I feel like it being in this bottle instead of a canned just makes it always taste better and it’s very affordable and you can get it I just any store so I highly recommend going out and getting one right now! ￼￼
--------------------
Coca-Cola cherry is so yummy! So flavorful and thirst quenching! I don’t drink a lot of soda, but this one is a favorite!
--------------------
Cherry coke is my absolute go to ! I love this stuff ! I can’t help but chug this bad especially if it’s ice cold !
--------------------
I’m a sucker for a good cherry flavored drunk without it tasting like medicine. Good flavor, good caffeine and carbonation. I love it as a special treat here and there.
--------------------
I love coke I drink it every day it’s my source of caffeine. It is the best and give the best taste.
--------------------
I love the charry OMFG This is the best Cherry Coke in the world! It tastes just like cherry coke! I would buy this again for sure! Mmmmm that initial burn that actually hurts! LOVE THE PAIN!
--------------------
I love how strong the cherry flavor is in this coke. Such a refreshing drink to have on a hot day. Will drink again. Fair priced.
--------------------
21 years ago my obsession with Cherry Coke began. It was a pregnancy craving that stayed with me long after the birth of my daughter. I would be heartbroken if they ever discontinued it.
--------------------
I love Cherry Coke. It has a nostalgic taste to me. I prefer this sugared version to the Coke Zero version. Nothing beats a classic.
--------------------
I absolutely love this soda it’s my favorite I buy it all the time it taste so good I would definitely buy again and definitely recommend this product
--------------------
I love, love cherry Coca Cola it is my favorite Coca Cola. Just love the cherry cola
--------------------
coke cherry is my FAVORITE soda in the world i crave it all the time. there is no other soda on the planet that can replicate the flavor of this soda and it is a timeless classic i will always purchase when i see it!
--------------------
Not a true fan of coca cola experimenting with new flavors. If just by itself, the originak is too sweet I can't imagine a "frutal" flavor bringing even more sugar to it or just to taste
--------------------
This is my favorite soda. It reminds me of the movies and I love to drink it with popcorn. It has a great hint of cherry with the iconic Coke taste!
--------------------
I have always been a coca-cola fan, but I am an even bigger fan of the cherry coke products!! Just enough cherry to give it that perfect compliment
--------------------
i tried coca cola cherry flavor and absolutely hated the taste. coca cola original flavor is the best and i'm never going to try another flavor after trying cherry one.
--------------------
This is the only flavored Coke product that I really like. It has a nice flavor to it. Just as regular coke, it is high in sugar content. So if watching calories etc, this shouldn’t be enjoyed every day.
--------------------
I love Coke. Love it. So Cherry Coke kind of fits in there by default. Its second only to Vanilla Coke in my opinion.
--------------------
This was a little too sweet as compared to the original coke flavor. I can really only handle a small sip of this
--------------------
Cherry coke with some ice on a hot sunny day is the best thirst quincer. With cherry oh yeah and its better with some adult beverages
--------------------
I HATE cherry favoring it reminds me of cold medicine. But Cherry Coke is always a go to for me when I'm getting a soda which isn't often.
--------------------
Coca Cola is one of my favorite sodas and the cherry flavor, especially cherry vanilla is the best. Cinnamon is a little weird, and orange vanilla is okay, but cherry and vanilla are so sweet but not overpowering. Fairly cheap and worth buying

--------------------
great cherry coke I love the old fashioned flavor of cherry coke and this brings me closest to that same taste easy to find at the store
--------------------
These are alright. To me, they don't taste much of cherry. It can be overwhelmingly sweet if you're not used to a whole lot of sugar. There's definitely a hint of it, but it's not as good as some other sodas where it tastes absolutely rich with fruit flavors. I think I'd buy it again, but if I had to choose, this wouldn't be my first choice...
--------------------
I already love coke by itself but adding the cherry makes it even more great!! I really recommend if you haven’t tried it!
--------------------
Cherry Coke is my overall favorite beverage. It’s nostalgic. You can go to a diner and get a sweet cherry coke and enjoy the moment. It is an experience. It is a flavor that can’t be replicated. It is affordable. It goes great with all meals. Tastes great as a mixer. There are not enough good words
--------------------
love them! they taste so good and literally my favorite soda drink and they have different flavors
--------------------
Cherry coke is my favorite. As a kid we used to go to the corner store and order a coke and have the guy at the register put cherry syrup in our cokes. Definitely my favorite!!
--------------------
Nothing beats a good cherry coke! If has such a good flavor and it is very refreshing.
--------------------
This is, by far, my favorite soda. It has just the right amount of cherry flavor so that it isn't overwhelming. I absolutely love it!
--------------------
This is my favorite flavor for coca-cola! I would drink so many of these if I could but only drink one a day!
--------------------
I love cherry Coca Cola more than I do regular Coca Cola. I think it adds a little bit of flavor and makes it a tad sweeter without it feeling too sugary
--------------------
A nice sweet flavor. The cherry mixes nicely with the coke. I like a bottle once in a while for a treat. Good color and carbonation.
--------------------
This is my favorite flavor of Coca-Colas, especially at the movie theater. The cherry just adds a little something special to the coke and I always get it whenever I see it’s available.
--------------------
Good taste. Easy packaging. Different kinds. Would recommend to others. Enjoyable drink.
--------------------
I love grabbing one of these when I go shopping. It fits easily in my purse and is the perfect size for my small hands.
--------------------
Cherry Coke is another one of my favorite flavors. I love almost cherry anything so cherry coke is no different. The price for all coke is great and not super expensive.
--------------------
I very much prefer coke over pepsi products any day but cherry coke is one of my favorite choices. I love the sweentess the cherry brings to it.
--------------------
I'll drink it but it wouldn't be a preference, especially between this and Pepsi. Coke is very harsh when going down, super fizzy and more salty than other brands. It's affordable.
--------------------
This is so crisp! Has a great cherry flavor and puts a smile on my face. Very refreshing! Satisfying! I will buy it again and I recommend.
--------------------
Coke is my top favorite soda. I like diet coke, Cherry Coke, regular coke, zero calorie coke.Every time I'm at a restaurant I will get a coke or when I'm at the gas station I will get a coke. When I'm doing my grocery shopping I will get a diet coke or regular coke, or zero calorie coke. I like the crisp taste when you take that first sip of coke. I also love the color of the can red is my favorite color, and the font of the coke writing is nice too.
--------------------
Yummmy so good I can taste it this is my favorite coke and vanilla flavor It is drank special when I want to treat my self
--------------------
Cherry coke is one of my addictions. I am a huge fan of coke, and their cherry coke is pretty darn good. I would recommend trying it!
--------------------
I’m really not a fan of Coca-Cola - it has so much carbonation, it makes my eyes water and my nose burn, and it doesn’t have a ton of flavor. But I thought that this would have more flavor with the cherry added. The carbonation is so much, it pretty much masks the cherry flavor. I don’t really get this unless a restaurant doesn’t have Pepsi products.
--------------------
Cherry cola is definitely my go to, especially at the movie theaters. Gives you that hint of cherry flavor that is not overpowering.
--------------------
This is a refreshing cherry cola with just the right amount of cherry flavor. It also gives you a nice afternoon boost of energy as a snack.
--------------------
Coca-Cola Cherry is a childhood favorite. It has a light cherry taste in the classic coke flavor. It’s wonderfully carbonated. It goes well in ice cream floats. I would purchase this again as a special tear.
--------------------
You can't go wrong with cherry coke. My kids love a frozen cup of cherry Coke as a nice cold treat on a hot summer day.
--------------------
Cherry coke is my favorite soda,period! A lot of different brands try to copy it and it can’t be done. This is just perfection!
--------------------
I think that the cherry flavor to this soda gives it such a great flavor. It’s very refreshing and is one of my favorite soda flavors out there
--------------------
Cherry coke is my favorite pop. There’s nothing better on a hot day than an ice cold coke and the cherry flavor takes it to the next level.
--------------------
I prefer the cherry coke over any other flared cook.it could be a bit too sweet but it’s good.
--------------------
I just recently bought this from my local market. My boyfriend loves and has to have soda's so this is mostly what I buy for him. I love it because it has the cherry flavor to it and you can not only drink it straight but its better if you mix it with vodka!
--------------------
I've tried quite a few varieties of this Soda. It has to be my favorite Soda out there! It's delicious, sweet and wonderfully fizzy. Enjoyable for everyone of all ages, packaging is simple and is worth the price. what more could you ask for? highly reccomended!
--------------------
This in my opinion is the best COCA COLA (coke) product, i have tried everything else out but i always come back to the original coke, i love all the flavors but this cherry coke is the best thank u to Coke for allowing me to review this product
--------------------
I absolutely love coca cola. It tastes so delicious and is very refreshing. I don't recommend this if you are on a diet, because it has a lot of calories just in one bottle. However is you are not on a diet, I recommend this soda 10/10 I will purchase this product again.
--------------------
This cake cherry was a every day thing for me in high school. The first time I tried this I was so surprised that it actually tasted like cherries.
--------------------
Not a fan at all. The cherry tastes like candy. I won’t buy again. I love the regular coke
--------------------
Cherry coke so good! So much flavor you want to keep drinking it! We are a repeat customer! I would love to see this in the small cans. Love this coke!
--------------------
Cherry Coke is probably my second favorite flavor of coke products. I absolutely love a nice refreshing cherry coke now and then
--------------------
This is a classic! It’s very sweet but I love this soda with popcorn at the movies. It isn’t very expensive
--------------------
This is a great product! Is it awesome quality, worth the price and definitely will be buying in the future! Great brand!
--------------------
Fiancé loves Pepsi so glad target has great deals
--------------------
Pepsi is the worst, Coca Cola taste way better.
--------------------
I love this product Pepsi is my only go to soda it gives me the sugar I need to get through the day and whenever you have a pizza to wash it down with you Gotta have a Pepsi￼
--------------------
Gives me my soda fix without going overboard.
--------------------
Something tasted off about the pack I received. I tried two cans and it kinda tasted off/flat. I love pepsi but I think I got a bad batch.
--------------------
Good price, tastes great no issues
--------------------
Product is great, I purchase with the intention to take advantage of their promotion (buy 2 get 1 free) it so be that 2 of my 12 packs were “unavailable” so I’m stuck with a $5 pack of sodas that I could of bought for much less. This pick up now feature needs to add a suplemento choice.
--------------------
Listed online as cans in the title and description but this is for the small bottles as shown in the photo
--------------------
These are small bottles that are easy to put in your adult-sized lunchbox
--------------------
Classic flavor that comes in a much better portion size for lunchboxes and while you're travelling
--------------------
Pepsi Classic. You can't go wrong with the blue. My favorite soda
--------------------
Pepsi is classic. It's what I drank growing up...and now much more so in moderation, but this remains my go-to for the classic cola.
--------------------
I love sprite. If I get a soda this is always what I get. Super refreshing and crisp. Cheap.
--------------------
Try mixing this with green apple snow cone syrup and apple juice as a party punch, when parties again become a thing. I promise you won't be sorry, sprite is a great starting point for a lot of things, I sometimes use it in place of water for marinades and even in cakes!
--------------------
Terrible for you but atleast it’s good. Horrible for your teeth but great for a stomach ache or hangover!!
--------------------
Favorite drink to get when I’m out and about at restaurants or just thirsty and in a need for a soda.
--------------------
Sprite is my favorite clear soda. I drink at least a case a week sometimes more. Its great for when your sick, an upset stomach, to just drink, for special occasions, and for hot summer days. It's refreshing just the right amount of lemon and lime. The packaging fits the product and is convenient to carry. Sprite Original

This is the best thing to mix any fruity vodka flavor out there! Can’t think of anything better.
--------------------
Yummy yummy yummy. I have always loved sprite. Easy to drink and not too strong. Sprite is the best
--------------------
My favorite caffeine free soda. Best super cold. Ice also enhances the flavor for sure

I recommend this pop to everyone. It has a nice crisp refreshing taste. You can buy it most places and the price is affordable. This is also a great drink for when you have an upset stomach
--------------------
If I drink a soda this will absolutely have to be one of my favorites it doesn’t even feel like your drinking something that may not be great for you perfect flavor combinations
--------------------
Always been my favorite definitely a thirst quencher . Great choice if you don’t want anything dark like coke or don’t want water

--------------------
I like sprite better than 7up. I’ll drink this when I have an upset stomach. No to sweet. I also like to add to my frappe.
--------------------
I love Sprite for many reasons. It's a clear soda so less dye, and when my stomach is upset or I'm sick it makes me feel better. I alway make sure we have a bottle in our fridge. I think it is a great product and always buy it. I hope they make more flavors soon! Great soda I highly recommend it!
--------------------
I just started liking sprite abiut 2 years ago.. it’s my boyfriend’s favorite and i started drinking it and now I like it.
--------------------
Sprite and Coca colas are must haves for gatherings. Guests usually loves to have one or the other. Sprites are also great for hangovers!
--------------------
This Is one of the few carbonation drinks I can drink! Very yummy and light on my tummy. I wouldn’t change.

--------------------
Great refreshing drink, one of the best thirst quenchers. I highly recommend Sprite on any presentation.
--------------------
Not a healthy choice in general but healthier than other sodas. Sprite is the only soda i drink because it doesn't leave as much of a gritty/sticky feeling on my teeth like coke. The lemon and lime balance out the sweetness and so I find it more refreshing than other sodas.

--------------------
It’s a good product. I like it, not to expensive and I think the glass doesn’t give it a metallic taste.
--------------------
I love it is refreshing alone or to accompany meals. It doesn't matter, summer or winter. #influenster #voxboxme #Voxbox #sprite
--------------------
Refreshing and light. Not too sweet or strong. Subtle hints of lemon and lime flavoring make it exciting and delicious
--------------------
Pairs well with a lot of alcoholic drinks or refreshing on its own if you’re craving flavor and carbonation. Prefer this one compared to 7up or Sierra Mist.
--------------------
This is my usual if I get fast food which isn’t that often. I’m not really big on coke
--------------------
Sprite is Sprite. I have no complaints, i'm not really a soda drinker,but if I do Sprite is my go to. There really isn't anything else to say I haven't have any problems with it.
--------------------
THE BEST SODA FOR COCA COLA! It’s fresh, light and taste great with any food you choose. I love the mini can Sprites to control my in take. It’s affordable and very popular. Only soda I buy! Repeating consumer.
--------------------
Although soda isn’t the best for you spite always helps my upset stomach and definitely helps cramps on that time of the month so I love it
--------------------
Great flavor. Great mixer. Keeps its bubbles. Favorite soda brand. Kid and adult approved. Price is reasonable and easy to find at all stores and wholesalers.
--------------------
man this drink really slaps, you’re sleeping on this if you haven’t tried this. but i wouldn’t give an alternative like 7Up. 7Up gives like a weird taste and the after taste is weird. so i recommend sprite:)
--------------------
We love sprite. It’s yummy and refreshing. Specially when we have any tummy aches. My family and I really enjoy this drink.
--------------------
Sprite is good no matter how you have it. BUT if you want the best sprite you’re ever gonna drink go to McDonalds. It’s CRISP.
--------------------
Sprite is something I only like to drink when i am sick. The price is comparable to so other carbonated drinks.
--------------------
Not normally a fan of much soda besides sprite if I’m going to be honest with this one.
--------------------
Always been a fan of sprite. When I have an upset stomach I drink it and I would get this if they don’t have my other drink.
--------------------
I prefer coke over Sprite, but if it's available I don't mind it. It's a little sweet for me, but I do like the fact that it's caffeine free. I've tried caffeine free coke, but I don't remember it tasting great
--------------------
I'm not normally a soda drinker, but when I'm under the weather and not feeling well, Sprite is the first thing I reach for. If you have an upset belly at any age, Sprite will settle it right down for you. Enjoy the fresh taste too.
--------------------
Soda is by no means healthy, but Sprite is a soda that I can consume without any guilt. It is compatibly better than other sodas, and the fact that it has no caffeine is great! The lemon-lime taste is amazing and always refreshing. In addition, Sprite is incredibly versatile and I’ve seen it incorporated into many types of punch, cocktails, etc. Sprite is my favorite!
--------------------
I really enjoy this product, it is very crisp and refreshing and perfect for those who don’t like to drink darker liquids. I find myself drinking this more than other sodas for the fact that it is so refreshing!
--------------------
Love this soda without the caffeine. I had to give caffeine up because I was consuming to much and this is a great alternative
--------------------
I love sprite!! So bubbly and sweet. It’s always a good price too. Definitely better cold!
--------------------
This is my go to soda drink. The lemon lime flavor is perfect not over bearing and still able to enjoy meals without and aftertaste
--------------------
Sprite is my favorite soda. I often request it in restaurants. It’s pretty affordable.
--------------------
I have always liked Sprite. Especially easy when I have an upset stomach or when I just feel like something light tasting. Soda in general has become pricey so I often buy the cheaper store versions. But if I am out and about this is one of my choices for sure.
--------------------
These specific size cans of sprite are fantastic for mixing drinks and not wasting a ton of one beverage.
--------------------
I'm giving this a 3 star review personally, as I dont like soda. However, i find this to he way more tasty than mountain dew! Really punchy flavor and good carbonation. However, it has wayyy too much sugar and that is a huge turnoff for me. I wont be buying again.
--------------------
Get you an ice cold sprite it will for a fact get you right. I always have one with my meals. Strong lemon lime taste after every swallow. Sprite
--------------------
Sprite is so tasty and the fact that it is clear makes it better to not worry about spills.
--------------------
Great choice when feeling thirsty and looking for something sweet. Perfect calories and great for gasses.
--------------------
Sprite is my go to drink. I need flavor in whatever I drink and it doesn’t have caffeine so it’s perfect for me.
--------------------
Sprite is one of my go to sodas. I do not buy soda very often but when I do I mostly buy sprite. It is very refreshing too.
--------------------
Drinking soda is more nostalgic to me as I only drank it at family gatherings and parties. goes great with spicy food
--------------------
I like Sprite and the ability to add extra flavor to it. If I want cranberry,blueberry or pomegranate in it they blend together so well.
--------------------
Its Sprite. Like my favorite drink. My favorite cocktail to make with sprite is something that I call "SPRUNCH" aka sprite and hi-c fruit punch. Its literally the best drink ever. I feel like when I'm 21 I will be adding sprite to actual alcoholic cocktails
--------------------
I absolutely love Sprite! This is the only soda I can drink that won't cause my skin to break out. The best way to drink a Sprite is ice cold there is no improving sprite. I wouldn't change anything about sprite they aren't expensive and they are a real thirst quencher.
--------------------
they comes in a cool packaging system. they have different size bottles, glass containers as well as in cans.the cans are colourful, very attrative and eye catching. I like sprite and recommend to all .
--------------------
This is such a good drink. It helps with stomach aches and has no caffeine! It is also refreshing
--------------------
Sprite is my go to drink ALWAYS!! I don’t know if it’s because of the container or just the flavor itself but this is my favorite Sprite drink! It’s so delicious and just taste fresh and is cheaper than expected!! I highly recommend if you love sprite trying this kind!
--------------------
I mix this with drinks all of the time. I even add alcohol to this. Sprite is my go to because I have up cola.
--------------------
Love sprite! The taste is so good. It has a great taste of lemon but not too heavy. Love that this drink goes well with anything! I can drink this soda all day and still want more! I would definitely buy again
--------------------
Not a tru fan of sprite either but I must admit that a cold Sprite it's a huge relief when the summer is kicking in. Its limey and refreshy
--------------------
Most soft drinks are delicious. They are absolutely terrible for us. Nothing but sugar. But that’s why we love them so much. Delicious, refreshing full of caffeine and sugar. Who doesn’t want to be bad sometimes.
--------------------
Also a favorite - Sprite just has that power of tickling your tastebuds and satisfies your craving of a bubbly lemon-lime experience. I like to drink this when I am out and about, or when my stomach doesn't feel well. The bubbliness soothes my stomach when it's upset. I also like to mix grenadine with Sprite to make shirley temples.
--------------------
Sprite tastes good to start with but in a bottle it is even better! I think it tastes way better than it does in a can. Try it from a bottle & then a can & you will see the difference. Sprite Soda 12 Oz Bottles 8 Pack
--------------------
I always buy these sodas there so good . I enjoy drinking these . I would recommend it to everyone.
--------------------
I mean sprite is a universal mixer for alcohol and when it comes to by itself it is hard to beat that crispy lemon lime taste.
--------------------
I love sprite because it doesn’t have caffeine and it goes with anything. Very refreshing and I love the carbonation
--------------------
It is a product that is cute and easy to use and I recommend it for use una bebida refrescante

--------------------
I love love love sprite! Room temp, frozen, on ice or even better as a mixer! This is a perfect drink by itself or mixed!

Sprite is my go to for soda. It is so refreshing with it lemon lime flavor. I prefer to let mine sit in the freezer and get just frozen enough to be a slushie. On a hot day?! Ahh nothing like a sprite slushie. Of course I recommend sprite!!! I just recently found out a cherry sprite exists. So I have to try that now & will let you guys know how it is!
--------------------
I love Sprite. It has this fizzy lemon, lime taste. I like sodas, and this are one of my favorites.

Like this because I’m not a caffeine drinker abs this gives me a bump when I need it.
--------------------
One of my favorite drinks I drink one or two can a day to take my medicine and the packaging is so satisfying I wouldn't improve this product because it is awesome. And the price is affordable not expensive and I would like to recommend this to others. Sprite Lemon Lime Soda, 12 Ounce (48 Cans) (4pack)
--------------------
I’m not fan of the sodas but not is healthy, but when I drink this is my second option, my first option is cansa dry ginger ale
--------------------
Sprite is my go to drink. It's refreshing with a wonderful lemon lime taste. I drink it cold or room temperature.
--------------------
Stays true to flavor and has nice packaging. Taste Lemony and refreshing. It tastes great with any food or even by itself. It’s affordable I will be buying again
--------------------
Wonderful cooling drink. Perfect for hot summer days. The postage is expensive, but for the hot summer days worth it to me.
--------------------
it’s rly good. Whenever I drink this it taste like static. It is a good flavor and stuff. If you leave it out for like 5 min it gets flat. It’s a good value. Worth it. Reccomend, bye have a nice day day!
--------------------
Sprite is one of my favorite sodas. Mostly because of the virgin Shirley temple drink.
--------------------
Always a refreshing taste in my mouth whenever I drink it . Compare to a a lot of other things I would recommend this when you have a dry mouth and want something refreshing .
--------------------
Coca-Cola is amazing. The taste is somehow a dessert with this sense of delicioussness that is so artificial, yet amazing. What I will say is that one can of coke is the equivalent of a plate of cookies. At the end of the day, I'd rather have a plate of cookies.
--------------------
I don’t really drink cokes, but this soda is my favorite. It’s so refreshing and not too strong. I love it!!
--------------------
I like to Drink and more with these products I really like the good taste #GoodByeJuly
--------------------
Sprite is my favorite soda because it’s the only caffeine free soda that’s widely available everywhere you go I highly recommend it to anybody who doesn’t like caffeine and loves lemon lime.￼
--------------------
I love the sprite it is so good even though it’s flight. The flavoring of the lemon and lime is so exquisite. #Sotto #Sprague #Mia #Sprague #MyLifeIsGreat #NotFlat #SuperFlat￼Sprite 85 Fl Oz Aluminum Bottle
--------------------
I am not a big fan of sprite but my kids love it. It isn’t expensive at all and it is a good lemon lime flavor.Sprite 85 Fl Oz Aluminum Bottle
--------------------
Sprite is my favorite soda! I don’t drink it a lot because of sugar but when I do I love it! Has the best flavor and has a great flavor
--------------------
I love sprite is my favorite soda ik it’s not healthy but I drink it 2 times every 2 weeks .but it taste so good The flavor is amazing
--------------------
I like how it taste! And love the fizz. It was a really good value. And really refreshing to drink. I would improve this by adding more flavor and a tad bit less fizz
--------------------
Party night favorite right here. Great value for what you receive. Long time favorite
--------------------
Sprite is just a must have! My youngest loves sprite! He will choose this over any other flavored drink!
--------------------
Sprite is the perfect drink to have when having a party. Also it is the perfect fountain drink. And it taste so good.
--------------------
Best tasting drink! The bottles get finished quicker than we can open them!
--------------------
Just enough to “Do the Dew” without feeling like I drank my sugar intake for the week. Tiny cans are the best!
--------------------
This is the perfect citrus blend with a caffeinated kick!
--------------------
Delicious! With ice, magical. I always keep some type of soda in my house and although I don’t drink it often, I treat myself after a week of following a routine. I slowed down on fast food, a lot, but having an ice cold Coca Cola with a home made veggie (I’m not vegan) or turkey burger helps keeps me on track for the most part.
--------------------
TIMELESS CLASSIC. nothing in the world beats an ice cold coca-cola. Important to know how addictive the drink can be. Once you start it’s hard to stop. Nothing better than treating yourself to a glass pores over ice after a long hard day.
--------------------
Love Coca-Cola! It’s is so refreshing to drink cold and always great to drink with your food. Family loves it! Always got some in my fridge. Favorite drink.
--------------------
I drink way too much of this but it’s my favorite! You can’t go wrong with an iced cold coke!
--------------------
can never go wrong with a coke!! taste great and is amazing!! great for any restaurant drink!!
--------------------
Coca-Cola cold classic has been in this family since I can remember and I'm old.... Lol. It's the best dark Cola to drink. Whether it's fountain drink or out of a 2 litre, you are guaranteed a great drink. The only soda kept in my home!
--------------------
I really like this classic drink , but I don’t drink it often only when I really have too !
--------------------
You either like Classic Coke or you don’t, really. My review isn’t going to change your mind if you’ve already tried it. If you like it, though, what a great refreshment. Even the thought of it makes me want to pop open a can and take a sweet fizzy sip.
--------------------
I don't like Coca-Cola. It leaves a gross sugary film in my mouth and after a take a few sips it starts to taste weird.
--------------------
Always some coke and biryani goes really well , and sometimes in the evenings for refreshment purposes . I’m always satisfied but I consume less. I see people rely mostly on these drinks everyday (like an addiction) and it is important for the company to make it very safe for health and body even in longer run .
--------------------
Such a yummy product and staple in my household! I love this product so much and always have some!
--------------------
I love this!! Coke is always my go to pop! I grew up on it and it hasn’t changed it’s flavor.
--------------------
Great drink. Always good to have at parties or get togethers. Great to have in the house and a very refreshing drink always have at home
--------------------
The taste is good, but you’ll need your stomach to adjust to it. Whenever I drink it, I feel bloated and gross. I recommend only drinking a little bit at a time if you’re not used to drinking carbonated sodas like this. Drink with ice or refrigerate for better quality.
--------------------
I personally don't like it at all, it's too sweet, I don't like it and it's very expensive
--------------------
Who doesn't love coke what can I say except it's better then Pepsi everyone loves coke but the original is an always will be the best
--------------------
Go to soda if I’m really craving it! It’s my fave on some days but I hardly ever drink soda!
--------------------
My absolute favorite soda. It has a much better taste than any other “coke” flavored product.
--------------------
Coke products are a bar staple at my house. We use them often for mixed drinks and cocktails, as well as to drink on their own.
--------------------
My go-to. I am an addict. The original is the very best. Getting a little expensive these days, but still the fan favorite.
--------------------
Coke is my choice of beverage if I’m ever craving a carbonated drink! I prefer coke over Pepsi
--------------------
It tastes great when it is ice cold. I love carbonation and the carbonation on this is very strong.
--------------------
I am a classic girl. Classic coke only. It is the best tasting and not to sweet and goes great with any mixer and all occasions
--------------------
This is a classic soda. Great flavor. Usually very affordable. It isn't very good warm, it definitely needs to be chilled. Great for mixing or drinking by itself.
--------------------
Coca Cola is one of my. Favorite as long as it’s ice cold great with cocktails mixes
--------------------
If I'm going to drink soda, it's going to usually be a coke. You can mix up the flavors and it's always refreshing
--------------------
Great company, great product and quality. Could be some expensive. But is worth it at the end of the day. Will recommend.
--------------------
I don’t use to drink much Coca Cola but when I do I enjoy the classic one! It’s fresh
--------------------
If I am going to drink a soda, my go-to is definitely Coca-Cola (or sometimes Pepsi as I don’t have a strong preference either way). It is the soda I drink most often and the only soda I really order at restaurants or buy in stores.
--------------------
Bubbly as ever! This seems to be the coke variety that holds it's flavors best in the 2 litre. Packaging is classic-- but I would love to see the glass bottles make a come back. Repeat user, however I have a soft spot for coke from McDonalds. Obvi would buy again.
--------------------
This is definitely a classic drink. It can be found in my home, at any family get togethers and whenever I’m out I order a coke
--------------------
Very tasty drinks and it’s not too much. The can size helps to not drink too much. The perfect size to indulge in but not overdo it.
--------------------
The best cola period. I don't drink them every day, but sometimes I really crave a Coke. Nothing else comes close. There is no competition. Coke has the best cola taste.
--------------------
Coke is such a classic drink. I just try not to drink it too often due to the sugar amount but it is delicious. Can is superior to bottle.
--------------------
I love Coke a lot. It is very delicious and though I don’t drink soda much this is my go to
--------------------
This is just a classic and I find that it tastes better then Pepsi in my experience. I don’t drink much dark Soda but this is the one I would get if I had a choice
--------------------
Classic go to for mix drinks like a rum and coke or just a solid staple for a backyard bbq.
--------------------
I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE HAS TRIED COKE, BUT I WAS TOTALLY ANTI COKE/PEPSI FOR YEARS. I RECENTLY TRIED THEM AND NOW I AM TEAM COKE 100%. I dont know how much caffeine is in these, but it doesnt seem like much, I don't notice a difference when I drink them
--------------------
Sometimes need some soda to cheers up the day. Not good for everyday tho. Or for everyone. But for me, from all other soda types or brands, coca cola is my fave.
--------------------
Great packaging and taste. If there’s any soda I reach for, it’s this one. It goes with any meal and helps to buy in bulk.
--------------------
It’s a strong pop. I don’t drink for often. If it’s the only thing at the restaurant I’ll get it
--------------------
Im not much of a soda drinker. I quit drinking all soda years ago. They are way to sugary for me
--------------------
Love a classic coke. The flavor is crisp and rich. Lots of sugar, but if I’m going to splurge it’s the best way to go. I love the glass bottles, it makes me feel nostalgic.
--------------------
I love Coca-Cola especially in the bottle. This is the most refreshing drink ever. When I am on a diet and then I take a break this is the first thing I reach for because I miss it so much.
--------------------
Coke all the way! Took the taste test challenge back in the 80’s and of course it was coke for me
--------------------
Great flavor. Keeps its bubbles. Favorite soda brand in all flavors. Kid and adult approved. Price is reasonable and easy to find at all stores and wholesalers.
--------------------
There is a reason this is called classic and for mixed drinks there is nothing bettet
--------------------
You guys know Coca-Cola is addictin ￼. But it goes with everything, even with alcohol￼
--------------------
I love Coca Cola, my favorite one is the one in a glass bottle. Just add some ice and lemon and oh my gosh! So refreshing. I am aware it’s not a healthy drink but from time to time I like enjoying a Coca Cola.
--------------------
It taste great it’s refreshing af, it’s my go to soda taste great with salty food especially
--------------------
We drink these alot in our home the mini cans since it don't bring alot and don't go wasted the left overs. Its convenient I tend not to give my kids alot of soda
--------------------
This is an amazing brand. Not only this product but also all the products of this brand are amazing. I wasnt unhappy with this purchase as i wasnt with any other product of this brand. You guys should definetely give it a try. I know you wont regret and be happy just like me.
--------------------
You cannot go wrong with Coca Cola. It’s so delicious and refreshing. I love these glass bottles too
--------------------
I’m just a fan of the classic Coca Cola drink. I’m not big with the different flavors.
--------------------
I Love coke so much! It’s my number one carbonated drink. The only downside is the high calorie and sugar intake.
--------------------
I definitely prefer coke over Pepsi, I feel like there’s more flavor & carbonation in Coke!
--------------------
Love coke! But I also have cut way back. These mini cans are a perfect way to get my fix without sabatoging my healthy eating
--------------------
I absolutely love Coca-Cola. I now they aren’t healthy to drink in excess amounts but I have been addicted to soda ever since I was a child and I almost never would drink water and was always drinking soda. However, after getting into sparkling waters from the brands La Croix and Bubly, I have been drinking much less soda than what I used to. I hate regular plain water, and sparkling water has helped me get that water intake while also having it feel like I’m having soda. I will still drink Coca-Cola, I’m just trying to keep myself drinking much less of it than I used to because I used to drink 2-3 cans of Coca-Cola a day. Coca Cola Classic Soda
--------------------
I drink coke. I have tied other sodas but no one else compares to my coke. I love the taste. I love the bubbles and carbonation. Sometimes its expensive but its worth it to me. I will always buy it!! Been buying it for years.
--------------------
I like Coca-Cola so much it’s my favorite soft drink the packaging is really nice I wish it had less calories I would recommend it tho
--------------------
Our family loves coke and the mini cans are great. My cousins tend to not finish a regular can so the minis are great for our family.
--------------------
This is what I personally normally purchase weekly, for my roommate. The price is good for the amount of product. I do not care for it personally. I would improve this product by lowering the syrupy taste. It's doesn't taste great and cause indegestion issues.
--------------------
I mean, it’s Coke. It’s classic it’s a constant flavor that never disappoints. I’m not a big soda drinker and this size is perfect. I do not like wasting more aluminum on smaller sizes though
--------------------
a staple at my apartment!! Literally i’m addicted it’s my favorite soda and we go though a pack so quick!
--------------------
Coke is my favorite soda! I used to drink a ton of it (about a 2 liter every 2 days). I definitely drink a lot less now. I prefer it to Pepsi mainly because there is a slight kick to it. It's not super sweet like pepsi is. The price is always reasonable.
--------------------
Coca-Cola tastes a whole lot better when drunken with Pizza Hut pizza. Sorry to be so specific but please try it, you’ll love it
--------------------
Best dark soda in my opinion. I know it’s absolutely terrible for you but it is just really good soda
--------------------
Best drink ever. I’m a coke fan through and through. It’s a classic drink that never gets old for me. It also doesn’t get flat as fast as Pepsi or Dr Pepper in my opinion. What’s not to love? I’d recommend. 10/10 all day.
--------------------
I love the different varieties. Wish I could give ideas for more flavors. Very affordable. I drink it with ice or no ice.
--------------------
Who doesn't love some soda . If there was one brand of soda I like its coke . Always been my favorite even thought it does have a lot if sugar in it.
--------------------
I love Coca Cola it’s a staple in my house and family! It’s such a great product I buy it weekly and keep some in my car during the cold months !
--------------------
Great for party’s, social gatherings, family events, etc. Been drinking coca colas since i was a kid
--------------------
So good I enjoy the minis for an occasional beverage. Recommend it is affordable. BBC. Fb BBC. B. V. V
--------------------
it's COKE - what's NOT to like? although - lemme tell ya - the bigger the bottle, the least the taste. try the little squatty bottles alongside these bigger bottles - and all the way up to 2-litre - they're all entirely different in taste. the smaller the bottle - the better the taste - and glass bottles taste more like the original coke from years ago.
--------------------
this drink is so delicious it is one of my favorite sofas its bubbles in your mouth make you tickle, I love it.
--------------------
I love these in a can. It limits me to how much coke I actually drink. I love drinking coke!
--------------------
Coca Cola drink is my favorite drink I love it I have a t-start of it it a bule T-shirt
--------------------
I don't usually drink soft drinks but when I do decide to have one this is the one that I gravitate towards I love the flavor of the soda there's nothing to improve in this product it doesn't even compare to Pepsi and I would definitely recommend this product to my Influensters'!! Coca Cola
--------------------
I love this soda! This is always been my go-to soda for any event or time of day. I love the genuineness of this product and how it’s roots run deep. It truly has a meaning behind it and wants to create a product that not only they can make money from but you can enjoy at a great price.
--------------------
Coca Cola is the best coke you can drink with food. The flavor and caffeine I think it’s what gets people. It will make you burp and have you feeling a great taste with any kind of food. Definitely better than any other dark drinks
--------------------
Love coke a cola ,its sweet but not to sweet like Pepsi. Has thirst quenching taste. Best in tge bottles but like cans to.
--------------------
Are we really reading the reviews for this, or can we all acknowledged that we have tried Coca-Cola and it is superior? Yes? Okay, moving on.
--------------------
My addition I love the little cans they’re 90 calories and a good way to slow down on drinking soda I’ve found after one my craving is gone and satisfied
--------------------
I loved coke and it was one of my favorites during pregnancy and there is no need for improvement and I love the taste and i still think its the best drink ever to me and I love the packaging and I also love drinking it to wake me up. But i would always buy more of it
--------------------
Coca Cola is by far my favorite soda. Sodas in general have become so pricey that often I will buy the store version but if I am out and about, Coke is my number one choice! Pepsi? Please! That tastes like flat Coke! Come all the way!
--------------------
it’s like any soda. if you like the taste of i. then you will like the soda. is is very very bubbly. and i like the packaging
--------------------
Honestly I love coke products. Even a fountain coke tastes delicious. I drink cokes everyday. That is actually the only soda I do drink
--------------------
I prefer Diet Coke. I don’t like drinking too much sugar. It still tastes sweet and I like it better than the competitor. It’s not weak tasting and the flavor is perfect. I’ll always be a fan of this iconic drink. Just give me a Diet Coke and I’ll feel better.
--------------------
I enjoy a coke on occasion. The sugar isn’t as bold as some other sodas but it’s still there. I limit myself but really enjoy it when I splurge.
--------------------
Coke has such a better taste even their Diet Coke taste a lot better than other products. I am for Coca-Cola.
--------------------
I am not suppose to but I absolutely love dark soda. I always break out after drinking dark soda but yet I always purchase them. They are great when they are cold with a drop of cola slush.
--------------------
The best part about Coca-Cola mini cans is how small they are. This garbage is the embodiment of how America takes things that are fantastic in moderation - in this case sugar and caffeine - and turns them into mass produced, over processed, over packaged, optimally addictive, insidiously marketed, consumable products that are terrible for your body. One star is because the cans are much better for the environment than plastic bottles. The other is, again, because of the smaller size. But really the best way to get an appropriate portion of this is to respect your body enough to say “no thank you.”
--------------------
At lunch you cannot miss a delicious Coca-Cola at all times, it is the best flavor and it is what everyone loves
--------------------
No way in hell would I drink a Pepsi over a Coke! Coke is the #1 best soda pop out there, and anyone that says anything differently is lying. It pretty much goes with any meal! Coca Cola Coca Cola Influenster The Influenster App Influenster I’d promote this brand for free if I could, it is my kryptonite, and my anxiety relief! So smooth and soothing to drink!
--------------------
when i am in the mood for soda i will choose coca cola. it’s such a classic and honestly is refreshing when i’m really craving it
--------------------
I prefer the glass bottles and I prefer this over Pepsi because it feels like there’s more flavor and less sweetener involved. It’s personal preference really and I throughly enjoy this as a float or sipping on it flat when I want something sweet.
--------------------
My favorite soda of them all. I think everybody knows this but if you don’t you should try. but it’s not healthy
--------------------
My favorite with cognac!! It's delicious it's the only time I drink coke. My kids prefer coke when they want soda.
--------------------
Honestly I like both Coca Cola and Pepsi but I drink more Coca Cola but it I go somewhere and they have only Pepsi which is in many places, I do get Pepsi!
--------------------
The classic chaser and the soda that most people love! You can't go wrong with coke at a party. Everyone knows what coke is, does it even need a review? When opened, the fizz levels are just right, and is my go-to soda when I need a drink that will appeal to the masses
--------------------
Puppy Monkey Baby! That's all I can think of when I see Kickstart
--------------------
Want the old diet 7 up back the new has an awlful taste
--------------------
Love Diet 7up! We DON’T even like sugar free 7up. Quite a difference in taste. Bring back Diet 7up! Please.
--------------------
I do not like diet sodas and do not drink them. I actually ENJOY Diet 7 up
--------------------
Why cant I find regular diet 7 up anywhere in the stores ??? I DO NOT want 7 up zero , I see no reason to add a product that just confuses the general public . Just stupid !!!!
--------------------
We like the original diet 7Up, not the new no sugar diet 7 up. I think it must be made with a different sweetener. Please bring back the regular diet 7 up. I am having trouble finding the last bottles in my town!!!!!!
--------------------
I've been loving Diet 7UP for years , but my last 6pack 16.9 oz was just awful. It's as if they forgot to put sweetener in it. I thought it was just my taste buds but my granddaughter gagged on it. I ended up pouring it down the drain. I 'll buy it again but not for a while. Anyone else get a bad batch?
--------------------
I have enjoyed 7Up for many years and this is a smooth drink. My grandchildren are now drinking them and I can see the smile own their faces which lets me know they enjoy the taste.
--------------------
This soda goes beyond all of my expectations! Esp. for a diet soda! I LOVE the regular 7 up too, but my favorite is the diet! Exceptional taste!!!
--------------------
Diet 7-UP has a one of a kind taste the best soft drink
--------------------
When you can find them. Why is everyone suddenly out of them?
--------------------
I have adored 7up since a child. More so as an adult. The flavor peaks at its open and lasts even when warmed. I cannot compare to other lemon lime drinks, as they have not the caliber of this beverage.
--------------------
This the best drink on the market to me it's has no dye in it and no caffeine and low sodium and it has only one hundred forty calories. It has zero fat but what I LOVE about this product it's so smooth and refreshing.
--------------------
Excellent in quenching your thirst on a very warm day
--------------------
Great taste. Very refreshing! No sugar no caffine!!
--------------------

--------------------

--------------------
