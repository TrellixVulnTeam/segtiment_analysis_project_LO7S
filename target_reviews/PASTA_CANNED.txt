Loved it as a kid and now as an adult I love it the same.
--------------------
Last weekend I was feeling hungry in my local shop and decided to purchase a ready made meal from the store. The meal I decided on was Chef Boyardee canned lasagna. When I got home I prepared said meal and let me tell you my friends, that meal was the most flavourful, the most esquisete and the most unique lasagna I have ever consumed. Gordon Ramsaey himself would perish over the delicious goodness of this meal.
--------------------
I love this Canned product so much, When I get to half a can ( the recommended serving size) I think, " just one more bite." And then I end up eating the whole can.
--------------------
i love having a can of chef boyardee for lunch, and the lasagna is the best, even better then the one i make.
--------------------
Easy quick meal to make.
--------------------
I've been buying these for years. The recent batches have not been so good. The sauce is watery and less flavor. Does this yellow nutritional info band around the top indicate that there has been a recipe change? I can't buy this stuff again.
--------------------
I would eat it all year long I. Love this baby sooooooooo much that I. Always have at least 50 can of them in the closet
--------------------
This is one of the best canned things Iâve had in my LIFE! Definitely recommended for any pasta lover!
--------------------
I recommend it.
--------------------
AMAZING!! Please never take away the pop top can.
--------------------
The three layers of lasagna mean so much to my family it's like a art in the form of a beautiful dish. Layer one Love and Affection also known as the noodle, the noodle is a protective cover to the meat like love is a cover to the harsh world we live in and is vital to the lasagna. Layer two the meat or The bloodline we all share and the bond we all have, the meat is the heart and soul of the lasagna it's what makes a lasagna a lasagna. Just like the bloodline and bond we share and why we cuddle up by the fire and watch Garfield a tale of two kitties every year for christmas with our famous high quality Chef Boyardee lasagna cup. Finally layer three another noodle or the base, the foundation of our family without this we wouldn't love lasagna as much as we do. Also Lasagna would just be like a regular double cheeseburger no onions no pickles a medium size fries a large soda and of course FULL SAUCE!!!!! The dish is more equezite than just a regular double cheeseburger no onions no pickles, medium size fries, a large soda and of course FULL SAUCE!!!!! This why lasagna is vital to the family and why all traditions are based everything around lasagna.

Love this item better than the traditional Spaghettios brand. It is more of a soup base unlike Spaghettios, which is almost all pasta now.
--------------------
My 1 year old loves this stuff.
--------------------
I love having these on hand for a quick and easy lunch. This recipe is tasty and light, and easy on the tummy. It’s a little more costly than other brands, but it doesn’t mess with my reflux/heartburn so it’s totally worth it! Yum!
--------------------
They taste great and it is good to know they are organic and have cleaner ingredients than similar non-organic products.
--------------------
My one year olds loves it! It’s organic and delicious
--------------------
My kids love these !
--------------------
Has a great taste and much better than other brands
--------------------
These taste awesome, similar to the non-organic version. A little pricey, but worth it to me to know I'm giving my child organic/healthy. 4 stars just for price.
--------------------
VERY liquid consistency. More like a soup in a can than pasta! The ground beef in this is also pretty much non existent. Used to be much better!
--------------------
The texture and taste are perfect. I tried the first time, and it tasted sweet, sour, and salty. I would buy again.
--------------------
So many memories in this can .... I will continue eating this into old age.
--------------------
We love the sauce but can't buy it in ontario canada. Just wondering why they don't carry it in this country. When the borders open up again will have to stock up.
--------------------
I have enjoyed your spaghetti and meatballs for at least 20 years....What ever you did to change the canned recipe completely ruined Chef Bogarde Spaghetti and Meatballs .. GARBAGE NOW
--------------------
I know this is not the healthiest meal to eat, but out of the four classic varieties I've tried this one is the best. I have read other peoples comments saying the sauce is tomato water. I beg the differ. It has a creamy smooth consistency that is just perfect. I love the mild taste. it allows you to enjoy the pasta and meatballs. Call me crazy, but I do not heat this can up. I open and enjoy at room temp or hot summer day in the car temp. So maybe the sauce changes when heated up. But try it room temp. I know you will enjoy.
--------------------
I don't know what or why it was done but the sauce is basically water now . Just nasty stuff ... Please change it back.. look for old label cans .. so much better.....
--------------------
I used to love this stuff, it was a nice little warm meal you could throw in the microwave and go. In the last couple of months, the quality has declined steeply. What used to be wonderful, almost perfect sauce has been replaced in most cans with runny tomato water, making most cans an unpleasant, sloppy mess to eat.
--------------------
I'm 60 years old and I've been eating Chef Boarder Spaghetti and Meatballs since I was 17. Don't ever change, and never stop selling this product.
--------------------
I bought this yesterday and it was disgusting the flavor was so bad and tasted so bad.
--------------------
I had always liked it, but the store had been out recently and they just got some back in stock. I got home and opened it and it was just a watery slop that came out! Even thinner than the beefaroni! What gives?!?!? You can't even eat it with a spoon now, what actual spaghetti that was in it would slide right off the spoon leaving nothing but sauce! I'll not be buying anymore!
--------------------
As the title states, my kids love it! I started buying the pizza sauce years ago, and it's the only pizza sauce I'll buy for my family. The wife loves it, the kids love it. It's great. Even the cat likes it when we have a tiny bit of leftovers. The taste is great and I love the consistency. We have lots of cans at home, and I don't think we've ever run out. This is great because we eat it just about every night. And every day. I never get tired of it. We even turned off the water to the house because honestly, why would you want water when you can drink Chef Boyardee's pizza sauce? Sometimes the kids say "Dad, we want something else." and I simply say "NO. DRINK YOUR PIZZA SAUCE." and eventually they do. I caught my wife sneaking in a soda the other night, so I had to clean the whole kitchen and polish every can we had. The only downside is that it cannot sustain a cat for an extended amount of time. He walks funny now, so I'm gonna have to remove one star. On second thought, maybe that's just his happy dance, so I'll add the star back. Sorry, I doubted you. Anyway, the value is great and I like that I can buy it in bulk. It works in multiple situations too! We wanted to paint one of the walls in our house and since the paint was out of the question, we just cracked open a can of pizza sauce and smeared it on the wall. I like it, and it makes the room smell nice. Same with the car, we had to wash the windows. I didn't feel like driving to go get some window cleaner, so I just used the pizza sauce. I threw out the mattress, the pizza sauce cans feel better. The wife disagrees, but she'll get over it. Anyway, I'm rambling. I like the pizza sauce, don't ever stop selling it!!!
--------------------
I don’t understand why everyone is comparing this product to the pizza product when they were never alike in taste and this product came first before the pizza one. I’m pretty sure that most people could make a better meal than this one but I can’t help but like it. It’s a part of my childhood and currently a part of my pregnancy cravings.
--------------------
I have been making homemade pizzas ever since I was a kid , and I would NEVER use any other sauce, NOTHING else compares...
--------------------
Favorite food of my granddaughter. Consistent quality and recognizable brand.
--------------------
ITS SO DELICIOUS like I can eat it everyday if I could
--------------------
I love Cheif Spaghetti and meatballs! Its been a min from last eating a can. I recently got few cans for lunch. I have to admit, the flavor is different then what it was. Maybe its just me being older. Still, One can or 2 servings is just the perfect size for a adult meal. Don't know why there soy product in it. That in it self almost stop me from getting it. But its been years from last eating one. I wish I had old copy of can from back in the days, to see why the flavor change so much...
--------------------
I am a long time fan of Chef-Boy-Ardi. I grew up with several of their brands and it's always had a delightful nostalgia for me. Recently I purchased both the spaghetti with meatballs, and the (original) ravioli. Both were UTTERLY FLAVORLESS!! It was just mushy paste. I don't know what they did to the recipe, but it was disappointing! Way to ruin childhood memories. Please undo what you guys did.
--------------------
Unlike another reviewer. I've been buying this can of sauce by itself for a long time. I use at least a can a week. No, it's not the same as what is in the pizza kit, but it never has been. Best tasting sauce I've tried throughout the years. For the price it can't be beat.
--------------------
This sauce is not the same sauce that comes with the pizza. The sauce that comes with the pizza is amazing! But this sauce they added cheese to the sauce. It's disgusting! Those writing good reviews for this sauce just don't realize its the wrong sauce they're writing reviews for. SELL THE ORIGINAL SAUCE, the same sauce that comes with the pizza and you'll have a home run! And if you are going to stop selling boxes with the single pizza, and only sell the 2 pizza box, then you need to have 2 smaller cans of sauce.
--------------------
4 of my 8 cans came badly dented
--------------------
Iâve always loved the spaghetti and meatballs. I bought some recently and it doesnât taste like it used to. Itâs just not very good. I wonât be purchasing anymore.
--------------------
This pizza sauce is the absolute best pizza sauce available.
--------------------
I hate every single kind of sauce but yall pizza sauce is the best in the world i can even eat it with a spoon ill only buy yalls pizza sauce i love it so much i yalls the only pizza sauce i ever use
--------------------

--------------------
i love the spagetti& meatbals i loved thim they tasted so good def recomed for 1.00 for a 10 pack is amazing love them
--------------------
This pizza sauce is very flavorful, just like I remember it! I buy it to use on homemade pizza. It's delicious and zesty. I wish they would put this in the canned ravioli, rather than the awful sauce that is in there now!
--------------------
Been years since I've had them. Loved them as a kid so I decided to buy a couple cans. What did you guys do to the recipe?! It used to be salty and sweet. The meatballs are terrible. Stop trying to cater to these delusional health nuts. Everyone knows these aren't meant to be good for you. Stop coddling these dummies that don't understand that. Go back to making them a delicious guilty pleasure.
--------------------
I loved all your products theyâve always tasted great but now I tried your spaghetti and meatballs and it tasted off, when I opened the can it was almost dry looking or mud like, before it would just slide out the can, this time I had to scrape it out. When I heated it up it still looked odd like the sauce was too thick once I tried it almost had no flavor the sauce was thick and pasty and it didnât smell that good either .
--------------------
The original cans of spaghetti & meatballs were by far the best. These new cans with pork, chicken, & beef are terrible. Wish they had left both & let consumers decide which one to buy.
--------------------
I have a son with Autism and, unfortunately, this has become his favorite food. I wish we had never let him try it. These kiddos typically have eating issues and get stuck on certain things. Although we currently purchase more of this than I care to admit, I simply canât recommend this product. We are working hard to wean him off but itâs a challenge. In the meantime I worry about his health: ultra-processed, too many calories, incredibly high sodium, and saturated fat all combine to make one unhealthy product. Iâm sorry to the producers for being so blunt, but you know whatâs in the can. I want others to know just in case they havenât looked closely at the label so they can make their own informed purchasing decision. If you can find a way to make a healthier version - that actually tastes good - Iâll be onboard! Finally, like a previous reviewer, our cans have been very soupy lately. I actually have to drain some of it off and then Iâm left with less than 2/3 of a can of spaghetti and meatballs!
--------------------
I HAVE EATEN CHEF BOYARDEE RAVIOLI , SPAGHETTI W/MEATBALLS AND BEEFARONI FOR DECADES WITH NO COMPLAINTS. HOWEVER,THE LATEST CANS OF RAVIOLI AND SPAGHETTI W/MEATBALLS HAVE BEEN OF EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY. THE SAUCE IS SOUPY AND TASTELESS AND AS EVERYONE KNOWS,THE SAUCE IS THE SELLER FOR THESE PRODUCTS. I WOULD SUGGEST PEOPLE AVOID THESE PRODUCTS UNTIL CORRECTIONS ARE MADE.
--------------------
The Spaghetti and meatballs is a fantastic quick meal option for my little one. When you are having a long day and you need to feed your child quickly you can choose the Chef Boyardee for convenience and a hearty meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My son really enjoyed the flavor it was really bummed out there was only four meatballs in the can. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

With 3 children and Avery hectic life, this is always a great go to for a quick meal. The overstuffed raviolis are very filling and hit the spot. They're not to messy and quick and easy to make. Can't go wrong with that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My kids have been gobbling this stuff up for years! When they were little they would go through picky eating phases but they would always eat Chef boyardee! They love the ravioli too (and I will admit I do also). This stuff is great to keep in your locker at work because the shelf life is awesome and it's so quick and easy to fix in the microwave. Honestly you just can't beat the price either. It's just an all around awesome value. I always keep plenty of cans of it in the pantry!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
CHEF BOYARDEE SPAGHETTI & MEATBALLS Has been in my pantry since I was a child. It is a go to snack or dinner for my entire family. We all enjoy it and since it is so quick to make we can have it whenever we want. Plus it is inexpensive. My kids eat it and so do I. Like I said we always have some around and we will continue to have it! Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Chef Boyardee is just how I remember it, yet the sauce is better. It's a great quick snack and it is filling.. meatballs aren't bad. Am I saying it tastes like grandmas? No, but for something quick when your hungry or after school for the kids it's perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Not one to eat a lot of prepackaged food but I admit we do especially when in a pinch. Not my first choice but it was flavorful. Very easy to heat up and eat. Kids definitely did not complain. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Chef Boyaredee products are one of those memories of being a kid. They still taste just as good as I remember back then. I love them all but the spaghetti and meatballs have always been my favorite. It has the perfect balance of noodles to meatballs. It makes a quick lunch or dinner when I don't have a lot of time to prepare something. I usually make garlic bread or rolls to go with it. Great flavor, easy to make and filling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Wow! I cannot recall the last time I had Chef Boyardee Spaghetti and Meatballs in a can. It took me back to my youth with that same great taste and full feeling. It was a brief escape from "adulting" while revisiting a classic treat from years ago. The Chef Boyardee Spaghetti and Meatballs makes for a great on-the-go snack for adults as well as a satisfying meal for children. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The texture of the sauce combined with flavor contributes greatly to the pizza as a whole.

I eat Chef Boyardee meat raviolis on occasion when I'm too tired to cook and want a hot meal but it's been years since I've tried the spaghetti and meatballs variety by Chef Boyardee. I see why kids love it, soft noodles and no flavors that are too overpowering. In fact, it might be a little too bland for those of you who like traditional spaghetti and meatballs. I gave it 4 stars because I feel it does what it is intended to do - provide a quick, hot dinner for those on the go or for those little, picky eaters in your life. I myself will stick to the raviolis because I actually like them much better but a picky child would probably prefer the spaghetti. I'm just glad they offer a variety so my whole family can be find something they like when they are slammed for time; my husband loves the Beefaroni. Want a good, quick meal for the kiddos or a picky spouse you might want to give some of the Chef Boyardee varieties a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Chef Boyardee is the only prepared, canned food that I will buy. The meals are delicious, hearty, and have a great price point. The flavors are present and never taste like it came from a can. This doesn't compare to Nonna's pasta, but it's a great, quick meal from a trustworthy brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It is like my childhood in a can. My kids are picky eaters but they liked the spaghetti & meatballs and ask for it at least once a week. It is great for a quick simple meal for the kids or for yourself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My kids really enjoyed the spaghetti and meatballs. The noodles and meatballs are on the softer side but it had good flavor. Instructions were easy to follow. This is something I would purchase for the kids to have a quick meal. It's not something I enjoyed too much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The sauce tastes bland compared to the beefaroni, and its spaghetti is way too soft. I don't know why, but I like their beefaroni better.
--------------------
The sauce was runny and had no flavor, almost ketchup like. The noodles were plasticy and the meatballs were grainy and tasted like cat food. Never again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

What memories! Chef Boyardee creates memories. I can still remember going to Grandma's house and her giving us Chef Boyardee with Italian bread. How my brothers, sisters and I loved every bit of it. I just created all those delicious memories when I opened a can of Chef Boyardee Spaghetti and Meatballs. I felt like I was back in Grandma's kitchen while I enjoyed every bite of my tasty lunch! The sauce is perfect and a great compliment to the spaghetti and the meatballs...what can I say...I still saved them for last and ate them with a smile. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My daughter literally ate this in about 5 minutes. She is a picky eater but didn't hesitate at all. She loves the mini meatballs and kept telling me "mommy look, little food balls!" She told me it tasted yummy and that she wants me to continue buying it for her. I think that was a win! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have been eating Chef Boyardee since I have been a kid. I have now passed the great taste onto my son. I love the ease if we need to grab a quick dinner during our busy evenings. From what I remember, the taste is the same but the amount of meatballs has changed a lot. Plus, they are a lot smaller. We always have Chef Boyardee in our cabinet for those quick grab meals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I was sent this product to review and while I like the product...My kiddos love it! It's the same taste I remember from growing up which is comforting and convenient. The kids love the flavor. We purchased more at the time of getting this product. All of which have disappeared. I would definitely recommend to my mom friends that looking for quick, easy, delicious meals. Look, lots of kids are picky and I have several therefore, I am more than willing to buy this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I grew up as a kid eating the spaghetti and meatball from Chef Boyardee and even as an adult I still enjoy them to this day. They are so flavorful and delicious. They are so simple to make, literally open the can, dump in a bowl, and devour them. This has got such great flavor to it, the meatballs are amazing, and everything about them is wonderful. I am a mom of three boys and each one loves them as much as I do. It's a quick lunch favorite for sure. So easy for busy people and they taste so good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Chef Boyardee has always been a staple in our house. Even when I was a kid, it was always in my pantry. My favorite has and continues to be Spaghetti & Meatballs. My son is also hooked on it now. It is a fast snack or meal for him after football practice and I love that he can make it himself. Also it is also such a good value. I have to stick to a budget but with 3 hungry growing boys I need to keep a lot of food in the house. Like I said I always have cans of this around. I get sad when I go in the pantry to have some and my boys ate them all. Maybe I need to hide a can or two. Anyway, I recommend if you have never tried Chef Boyardee that you do. I have always been a fan and will continue to be. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

--------------------
I love pretty much every Chef Boyardee canned products, though I've noticed that the only real difference between the Mini Ravioli, Beef Ravioli, and Spaghetti & Meatballs is the texture. They all have exactly the same flavor, only the texture changes. And it makes sense, as they have pretty much the same ingredients just in different orientations. With spaghetti and meatballs you have long skinny pasta with meat on the outside, and with ravioli you have square past with meat on the inside. SpaghettiOs also taste the same just with no meat. So doing a review for one is like doing a review for all. I used to have these Chef Boyardee meals on occasion when I was a kid and I still love them today. We always try to keep at least a few cans in the pantry. If the recipe has changed over time then I cannot tell. The sauce is delicious, and that's really all you can taste. Everything else is texture and the texture of the pasta and meat is spot on. It's really hard to believe that there are no artificial flavors, artificial colors, or preservatives... how do they do that and still make it delicious and shelf-stable?! Do they have a wizard working in their factory? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Best spaghetti and meatballs EVER !! Maybe because I haven't eaten after years the taste and flavor [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Chef Boyardee is a brand I grew up eating. I now serve it to my children. I recently bought the Chef Boyardee Spaghetti and Meatballs. When my older children when off to school, my youngest and I sat down to this comforting lunch. He is a picky eater but when it came to this meal he gobbled it up and asked for more. I was lucky to get a few bites when he was done. It was everything I remembered, saucy, flavorful and so satisfying. I almost always have the Ravioli but I will be sure to add a few cans of the Spaghetti and Meatballs to my shopping list. This was so easy to make and clean up took a minute. Chef Boyardee is also great to take on camping trips as you can heat it on the fire! Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My guilty pleasure, it has simple yet tasty flavor. I like that I can eat it stray from the can, those rushing days that I do t have time to cook and feel satisfied. It is not something I eat often but really love when I do lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My grandson loves this but it is messy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I used to eat chef boyardee when I was a kid and now at the age of 36 I still have a can from time to time. This makes for a really easy and quick lunch or dinner. Pair with a salad and you have a decent meal. Chef boyardee is inexpensive and it's really great when you're on a budget. This may not suit every adults taste buds but I enjoy it, especially with a slice of bread and butter so you can dip it in the sauce. This isn't going to replicate real spaghetti and meatballs and it isn't trying to. It has that classic boyardee flavor. The noodles are quite soft in texture and so are the meatballs. Not much chewing required.lol. kids love this stuff . It's high in sodium like most canned foods so it isn't something I would eat or feed my son regularly but once in a while it's ok. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Chef Boyardee is a mainstay in our house for a quick, filling, tasty meal. Spaghetti and meatballs is a classic, and this was really good. Normally our go-to is beefaroni, but we'll be adding spaghetti and meatballs to the shopping list regularly too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have served Chef Boyardee products to my family for years. My children love Chef Boyardee Spaghetti and Meatballs. It has a nice combination of pasta and tomato sauce with great tasting meatballs. I love that this is an easy and quick meal to prepare and it is filling as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I really always did like Chef Boyardee Beef Ravioli because it's quick and easy but I don't recall it being preservative free. It's also has no artificial colors or flavors. Also I noticed on the can that it has a Non BPA liner. There's only 220 calories. Even the 5g of sugar is on the label. I don't remember this product being as good as it is now, nutritionally. But my favorite thing about the product is absolutely the convenience of the easy to use pull tab. No can opener needed. My children approve of the taste of the Ravioli as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Recently gave chef boyardee spaghetti and meatballs a try and I absolutely love it! What I love most about it is the simplicity of it, you pop the top, heat or eat it straight from the can, so it's super convenient and a quick fix! This spaghetti is very delicious, the sauce is flavorful, the noodles are cooked to perfection, and they're very generous with the meatballs which are also very delicious. I would highly recommend chef boyardee spaghetti and meatballs to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My kids absolutely love Italian dishes and pasta. From my own childhood I recognize and love Chef Boyardee. I'm always looking for a product to switch up our daily lunchbox routine for school. The spaghetti and meatballs from Chef Boyardee make packing my boys lunch so much easier. I'm able to heat them up in the morning and put them in a thermos and my kids get a great, warm, healthy lunch at noon. It makes me feel better that they can pack a delicious warm lunch instead of a regular cold sandwich. There are so many different flavors and recipes to pick from, we love the variety.

I love chef boyardee spaghetti and meatballs it has been my favorite since I was a kid and I have always ate this brand.Both of my picky children approved as well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I bought the Chef Boyardee Spaghetti and Meatballs for my toddler son who usually loves their mini ravioli. He took one bite of the spaghetti and meatballs and didn't want to eat anymore. I was very surprised. Although neither product is something I like, he usually eats half a can of the ravioli in one sitting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I used to eat chef boyardee when I was a kid and now at the age of 36 I still have a can from time to time. This makes for a really easy and quick lunch or dinner. Pair with a salad and you have a decent meal. Chef boyardee is inexpensive and it's really great when you're on a budget. This may not suit every adults taste buds but I enjoy it, especially with a slice of bread and butter so you can dip it in the sauce. This isn't going to replicate real spaghetti and meatballs and it isn't trying to. It has that classic boyardee flavor. The noodles are quite soft in texture and so are the meatballs. Not much chewing required.lol. kids love this stuff . It's high in sodium like most canned foods so it isn't something I would eat or feed my son regularly but once in a while it's ok.

Family loved it! Will purchase again... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

With the cheese already in the sauce providing an extra crunch after cooking plus some real mozzarella cheese on top. This is an excellent start for pizza made at home. I've used this before most pizza places opened up when they had do it yourself pizza kits at the store.

I spent 88 cents for a meal and it didn't taste like poverty. Thanks, Chef Boyardee.
--------------------
Been eating this stuff for several decades! The meatballs have definitely shrunk over the years, but the taste has remained the same. May not be gourmet food, but is pretty good.
--------------------
Only giving us two meatballs per 14.5 can is so lame and cheap that it leaves me wondering just how stingy you really are.
--------------------
Best pizza sauce around! The best pizza sauce to make snappy pizzas. A recipe from my youth 1960s, so good!!

I have been eating this since I was born. I don't care how soupy, or mushy this pasta is, it's my favorite. I never heat it up because it removes the flavor from it. Pop the top, straight in a bowl, and eat. Always good to have a few slices of bread to make half sandwiches. Thanks Chef!
--------------------
Good staple to have in the house for when the weather has you trapped.

My 6 year old granddaughter loved it!! She's an extremely fussy and picky eater so it's very difficult to find nutritious foods that she's even willing to try! This was a great experiment! Thank you very much! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Love to eat these with grilled cheese sandwiches. Yummm
--------------------
An old favorite from my childhood I occasionally get a craving for! This easy and simple meal is just like it used to be when I was little, and can’t stop myself from keeping a can on hand!
--------------------
What you would expect for pasta in a can; easy to make. Doesn’t need a can opener

Got this as a sample to try and boy was I impressed. We had gotten away from a lot of the canned pastas but this one was really good. Its quick and easy to make its filling and very good. I'd recommend this to anyone [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am 32 years old, and I still love a good 'ol can of Spaghettios. I really do. I know it's not the 'healthiest' meal choice, but when you are in a pinch, it is so good. Plus, it is a really great comfort food. Kids and adults love them alike! My kids like the ones with meatballs in it, I like the one without meatballs.

I have been busy moving kids across the country and Campbell’s Spaghettios Canned Pasta were the perfect quick meal. My kids are grown but that doesn’t stop them from loving a bowl of this yummy, easy to make pasta. We like to keep a can or two on hand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My kids love these spaghettios. They can prepare them on their own by just putting in microwave for a minute and instant snack. The price is right so I just keep a bunch in the pantry for that easy after school snack. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My daughter loves spaghettiOs. They have a nice mild flavor and are perfectly soft for my toddler. My daughter doesn’t like super bold flavors so these are perfect for her. I remember loving these as a kid so it’s super nostalgic as well. They are also super simple to prepare, just heat and serve. Always a quick go to in my household.

I haven't had these in years so i decided to try them again as an adult. They were still myvfavorite i realized after all these years. My kids love them too..

My kids loved the spaghettios. My boys like to eat the meatless spaghetti I just wish it didnt have the after taste of the sauce. I also think that it needs more flavor added to the sauce to make it taste better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I received a 22.4 ounce can of spaghettios to try. The can was so big and I didn't realize they even made them this size. I was impressed that it fed myself and my son and no need for another can. The ratio of spaghettios to sauce is spot on and perfect. The taste was great just like I would expect from Campbells. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love these spaghettio’s they are just how I remembered them as a kid. If you are busy and you need something quick to feed the kids this is the way to go ! It’s so simple to pop these in a bowl or a pan and heat them up for the kiddo when he comes home from school. I definitely recommend these! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It’s nice pasta to have it as snacks item. I would have personally preferred to have it more spicy, smoky flavor with some cheese topping. but that is my personal preference. Overall test is good to try it once [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Campbell's Spaghettios are a classic favorite, reminding me of after school in elementary. i love the spaghetti taste and the o's are fun to look at and make me happy. If you are ever in need of a quick snack and something that doesn't cost a lot of money then I would recommend grabbing a few cans of these from your local grocery store.

SpaghettiOs have been around for a long time and brings back good memories of my childhood. My mom would have this ready on cold winter days after school. It has that same classic taste. I like the pasta and sauce and my family does too. It makes a quick, little meal for work as I can put the can in my desk. The pull off can is very convenient and easy to open. I can just pour in a bowl and pop in the microwave. SpaghettiOs are a family favorite! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received a free sample of Spaghettios from Tryit. I was curious to try it again after not having it for years. I grew up having Spaghettios as a special treat as a child. I had not had them in over 40 years. They were pretty much as I remembered. They would be good to have as a side with a meal occasionally. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The original SpaghettiOs need something more than just pasta and sauce. Some protein would make them a little better, but the sauce still leaves something to be desired. I was always a fan of Chef Boy Ardee ravioli as a kid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Who doesn't like Campbells SpaghettiOs. I know for sure kids do but I myself being an adult love them. My bf can't have them anymore, he found out he has celiac disease. He says he sure does miss the taste of them. Kids love the round noodles shapes. These are low in fat and very yummy. All you do is just reheat no cooking required. SpaghettiOs have been around for many generations I have no doubt they will still be here for many more. My only complaint is I wish they were gluten free so people with celiac could enjoy them as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

These Spaghettio's are great, love the small can, easy to carry anywhere, they taste just like they do in the bigger can, this is good size to keep on hand for a quick snack or just for the kids. They taste great as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love Spaghettios, they are just an easy lunch for a busy day and I love that they are low fat and has vitamin A in it. it is so quick to make and it is delicious. I used to take care of kids and it would have saved me some trouble if I would have made it for them a couple of times for supper I know kids would love the Spaghettios and it is healthier than most of the canned goods.

Wow, SpaghettiOs are my favorite childhood lunchtime meal. The quality, taste, and convenience makes this product an excellent choice for lunchtime, or anytime, for that matter. They taste the same as when I was a child. I love it. My mother used to make these for me for lunchtime during the weekends or summertime. It was a staple. I highly recommend this product for anytime you want a tasty, convenient meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received a free sample of Campbell’s original Spaghettios from Tryit. I could not review it because the can came to my home very damaged. I did not taste the product because I was afraid that I would get sick from it because the can was so damaged. I would’ve liked to see if if was as good as I remembered from my childhood. I was very disappointed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The taste is the same and does bring back some memories but as an adult I wish the ingredients were better and fewer. As a once in a while snack no biggie but I don’t think I would want my kids to be eating this too often. But again it does bring back nostalgia of when I didn’t care how much salt was in the things I ate Lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Spaghettios have always been a favorite for my kids. We pretty much have eaten spaghettios growing up and they are just delicious. They have fun little o noodles, the tomato sauce is so good. The can even comes with a cool, fun design on it. They are quick to warm up, either on the stove or in the microwave. A good delicious quick meal for adults and kids, they are very appetizing. We all love Spaghettios, very nutritional also. I highly recommend to moms that have picky kids, who wouldnt want to eat some good spaghettios. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I grew up on Campbell's SpaghettiOs. My boys loved them. It'd been awhile since I've had any so I was looking forward to trying this. I should of cooked 2 can. The can went quick. Just enough tomato taste to make the sauce really tasty. The O's are flavored just enough. The SpaghettiOs are seasoned just right. Very easy to heat. I heated them up in a sauce pan. You could very easily put some in a bowl, cover it, and put into your microwave to heat. This will be a new staple in my cabinet. Can't wait to try the other kinds!!

Nothing screams childhood memories like spaghettiOs. I think you have to be under the age of 10 to really enjoy these. Once you grow up and have a taste of real food this simply doesn’t do the trick any longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Cambell's SpaghettiOs have always been a great go to meal for me. The grandkids love the shapes and the taste is always on point. They are simple to warm up and serve so I always keep some in the pantry. If you are feeling a bit hangry, these will get you back on track quickly. A great source of nutrients and vegetables with zero trans fat makes SpaghettiOs a win for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Whoever said Campbell's SpaghettiOs are just for kids has clearly never tried SpaghettiOs! SpaghettiOs in our household is our fun kid's choice main entree for dinner. We like to have our kids make the dinner selection and this is 100 percent of the time what they choose and mom and dad get to enjoy SpaghettiO's guilt free! Just as our kids do, we love the taste and the added bonus is the fact that our kids get some of their daily vegetables without them even knowing it and it is not even a budget buster for us. It is easy for our kids to prepare in minutes. Will always keep Campbell's SpaghettiO's on hand for our meals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I would have to say that the Campbells Spaghetti O's taste the same like they did when I was a kid years ago. I have always liked Spaghetti O's but tasting thing now just seemed like the same before.

I haven’t had spaghetti-os in about 20 years. I forgot how good they taste. And now I have gotten my son into them. He LOVED them. So yummy. I have never seen a more excited child then when he got a big bowl of his sized spaghetti. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

As a kid, I really enjoyed SpaghettiO’s. I thought I’d give them another shot, and I wasn’t really a fan. They had sort of a metallic taste to them. They were still creamy, as always. But maybe my tastes have changed as an adult. I know kids still love them, though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I received this to try and I'm glad I did because it tastes like my childhood. It brings back memories and I am glad I am able to share them with my children.

I haven't opened a can of SpaghettiOs since I was a kid , until the other day. I'm still a fan. The tomato sauce is mild and the rings are fun to eat.

I just sat down and opened a can of spaghetti Os. Perfect size can for one persons lunch. I really enjoyed them. I really like that you do not need a can opener to open them. Makes it easier to take on the go with you. They were just as tasty as I remember them. Will be enjoying more of them in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got these to try as I can never find the Campbells Spaghetti which I enjoy as a quick lunch occasionally. There is a slight metallic taste, and the sauce is not the same. Kids, however may enjoy. I also do not heat....just eat.
--------------------
I actually bought this to give to someone who likes Spaghettios as 50th birthday present. I was slightly disappointed that I received cans with the standard label, not the birthday label that is pictured. Now I'll have to eat them myself... which isn't that bad.
--------------------
Who can complain about spaghettiOs? the expiration date was good for mine which i'm always worried about buying online.

My 6 year old granddaughter is an extremely fussy picky-eater! It's a real challenge to even get her to try different foods. So it was great to see her enjoy something & I was grateful for the added calcium! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Many of the cans i bought had pretty large dents in them. This would make a lot of them unsafe for eating due to bacteria that can enter the can. 1 out 6 cans had really large dents that cant be safely eaten.

My kids love SpaghettiO’s! I was worried that they might notice any difference in flavor from the extra calcium but they were happy as can be. I would buy SpaghettiO’s Plus Calcium by Campbell’s again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I was brought back to my youth whilst eating these SpaghettiOs. The flavor is exactly as I remember it--noodles in tomato soup. I am glad the the SpaghettiOs have been updated with added calcium, because if I ever need a dose of nostalgia, I can grab a can of this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The new Spaghettios with Calcium is healthier and tastier with no artificial flavors, no preservatives, no synthetic colors while giving you a desirable boost of essential Calcium. The old sauce which was overwhelmingly astringent tomato flavor has been improved and mellowed so it tastes good for all ages. With the Spaghettios with Calcium, you can add your own mix-in items. I added diced ham, but you could also stir in cooked well-drained hamburger or chicken bits or hotdog slices for variety. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have always loved and used Campbell's and have never been dissatisfied. I also love Spaghettios and the fact that they added calcium intrigued me, so I decided to try them. Delicious just like the others!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is one of my samples and I can honestly say this is average product and my kids as well as myself love it we have bought extra just so that we can all have our own.

Love the easy open can. It is still the Spaghettios of my youth, even with added healthy feature of calcium. I was happy to see the healthy addition to a classic favorite. I would definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
These were my favorite growing up. They are still just as tasty as I remember them. The can boasts about how they are healthy for kid but I honestly don't think any parent serves Spaghettios thinking they are a healthy meal. In terms of nutrition, there are pros and cons. One can has no trans fat, only 1 gram of saturated fat, 50% of your daily calcium, 9 grams of protein, 11% of your daily fiber and 40% of your iron. But, on the downside, it has 24% of your added sugars and a whopping 47% of your sodium. Still, I find them to be an excellent comfort food when I'm seeking a little nostalgia. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I spent a lot of my childhood eating spagettios and I'm excited about the fact that now there is a version with extra calcium to make it even healthier than it was before. To me it still tastes the same way even with the added vitamins. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Thank you for the spaghettio plus calcium. This product was good it has good flavor then what I thought.

More than 2 cups of SpaghettiOs gives at least 40 percent of vegetable intake, 0 trans fat, and added calcium which gives that boost for bone support. With the pull-top can and a quick microwave, it is really easy to prepare and enjoy as a meal for whatever time of day. The spaghetti Os can also be enhanced with condiments such as salt and pepper or grated cheese. Highly recommend for the general public, for whatever time of day, this does the job.

I am not much a fan for canned anything but my wife is. These spaghettios didn't have a chance around her.....I tried to get a taste and almost got forked. Gotta go get my own cans....probably a case will do her for.....a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The container is small but you can clearly see the size of the product when you purchase it in the store. It is easy to prepare and the taste is very nice to me. as for the serving, I think it makes a perfect filler between meals or a side course during a lunch. I was satisfied with the flavor and the portion. I put some parmigiana on mine and this is absolutely delicious
--------------------
I like the taste but it literally exploded inside my microwave. 0/10 would not recommend.
--------------------
Allow me to begin with one word: remorse. It has been one year since my last purchase, and let me say that I never quite understood the feeling called "buyers remorse" until now. Firstly, the Mere Size of the Beefaroni is not nearly enough for the average human being. To illustrate my point, I will use the age-old art of storytelling passed down from my father, and his father before him. It was an overcast Tuesday night and I was at my apartment in Cleveland. I had just got off a long shift at the sheet metal factory, and I couldn't wait to go home to a nice warm meal. Thankfully, I live right around the corner from a 7 Eleven that stocks Chef Boyardee products, so I had something to look forward to. I picked up One Cup of Beefaroni at the store and brought it up to my apartment, but it was not nearly enough to take the edge off. Hastily, I threw on my slippers and descended to the 7 Eleven, where I proceeded to buy out their entire supply of Beefaroni (seven cups). To make a long story short, I consumed a grand total of eight whole cups of microwavable beefaroni, and it did NOTHING to assuage my appetite. This episode left me with a feeling of broken trust, and I am beyond disappointed with my experience. I would not recommend this product to a friend.

Hey just wanted to say this stuff means a lot to me. My friends mock me all the time for my fondness for the stuff but none of them sppreciate the great taste, reliability, and quick cooking time that makes for a quick and delicious meal that I can eat again and again and again. I never tire of it. I always smile when I see the chefs jolly little face looking up at me as I crack open a beefaroni. It will always be a part of my life.

Before I begin, let me clarify that I mean no tea, nor shade towards Wendy's, who's beef is fresh and never frozen. One moonlit night after 10:30pm Knights of Columbus Mass at St. Vincent De Paul Chapel, my friends and I were missing the company of a notable Knight and great friend, Joseph. He was wasting away in Leahy Hall working on a philosophy paper due the next morning, and we decided to fetch him some snacks from the convenience store to lift his spirits. Whilst there, we ran into a friend of his who had the same idea. This friend was very well meaning, but he made a grievous error: his snack of choice was peanut butter M&M's. We knew Joseph would not receive this well, but instead of correcting the young man we bought Joseph a cup of Chef Boyardee Beefaroni (the obvious choice). We ventured towards Leahy with our offerings like the three Magi, but there were no stars to guide us that night. We found Joseph in a detestable state, surrounded in loose paper and reclining far back in his seat. His friend first offered his meager gift of M&M's, but Joseph rejected them outright. "These won't do!" he cried. I gently placed the Chef Boyardee atop his scattered papers and took a step back. My friends and I watched as Joseph's eyes lit up. He reached for the cup with tears in his eyes and held it aloft, crying, "this alone will sustain me!" He shoved the cup in his briefcase and swung open the door to the study bubble. We followed him out triumphantly, for we knew that our choice of Chef Boyardee Beefaroni had rekindled the life within our friend. I would recommend this product to a friend.

These be hitting dif on god
--------------------
my daughter loved everything about these raviolis. I liked how easy it was to cook.
--------------------
Got via order pickup along with many items, didnt check exp date. Was 6 months past expired when u got it, now it's a year past. Lesson learned, always check dates. Wasted my money since it wont let me ask for a refund now. Otherwise it's good ravioli.
--------------------
Low sugar content and organic
--------------------
If you ever wondered what soggy cardboard tastes like, get this.
--------------------
Something with the texture is so off.
--------------------
Great option for a quick lunch.
--------------------
My kids love this! I agree with another reviewer that it’s a little sweet tasting but even my picky eater loves it.
--------------------
This doesn’t have the funny taste that other canned food brands give off and I actually enjoy eating it
--------------------
I do like that its organic, but my kids didn't like the taste. It was too sweet. It is also more expensive than the other brand they prefer.
--------------------
Easy to take to work if you haven't prepared food for the next day.
--------------------
My 6 year old granddaughter loved it!! She's an extremely fussy and picky eater so it's very difficult to find nutritious foods that she's even willing to try! This was a great experiment! Thank you very much! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Got this as a sample to try and boy was I impressed. We had gotten away from a lot of the canned pastas but this one was really good. Its quick and easy to make its filling and very good. I'd recommend this to anyone [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Spaghettios original has not changed. Still a great value and great taste. I eat these as an adult and boy do I enjoy them just as I did when I was a child. Pairs well with grilled cheese. I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Always been a fan of Spaghettios but was sent a can that was badly damaged. Doesn't seem to have any holes or leaks so I'm hoping its okay.

I love spaghettios! They are some of my favorite childhood meals. I still every once in a while get a craving for a bowl of spaghettios. I try to keep a couple cans on hand. Have your kid try it! They just might like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

--------------------
I am 32 years old, and I still love a good 'ol can of Spaghettios. I really do. I know it's not the 'healthiest' meal choice, but when you are in a pinch, it is so good. Plus, it is a really great comfort food. Kids and adults love them alike! My kids like the ones with meatballs in it, I like the one without meatballs.

I have been busy moving kids across the country and Campbell’s Spaghettios Canned Pasta were the perfect quick meal. My kids are grown but that doesn’t stop them from loving a bowl of this yummy, easy to make pasta. We like to keep a can or two on hand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My kids love these spaghettios. They can prepare them on their own by just putting in microwave for a minute and instant snack. The price is right so I just keep a bunch in the pantry for that easy after school snack. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My daughter loves spaghettiOs. They have a nice mild flavor and are perfectly soft for my toddler. My daughter doesn’t like super bold flavors so these are perfect for her. I remember loving these as a kid so it’s super nostalgic as well. They are also super simple to prepare, just heat and serve. Always a quick go to in my household. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I haven't had these in years so i decided to try them again as an adult. They were still myvfavorite i realized after all these years. My kids love them too..
--------------------
My kids loved the spaghettios. My boys like to eat the meatless spaghetti I just wish it didnt have the after taste of the sauce. I also think that it needs more flavor added to the sauce to make it taste better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I received a 22.4 ounce can of spaghettios to try. The can was so big and I didn't realize they even made them this size. I was impressed that it fed myself and my son and no need for another can. The ratio of spaghettios to sauce is spot on and perfect. The taste was great just like I would expect from Campbells. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love these spaghettio’s they are just how I remembered them as a kid. If you are busy and you need something quick to feed the kids this is the way to go ! It’s so simple to pop these in a bowl or a pan and heat them up for the kiddo when he comes home from school. I definitely recommend these! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
It’s nice pasta to have it as snacks item. I would have personally preferred to have it more spicy, smoky flavor with some cheese topping. but that is my personal preference. Overall test is good to try it once [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Campbell's Spaghettios are a classic favorite, reminding me of after school in elementary. i love the spaghetti taste and the o's are fun to look at and make me happy. If you are ever in need of a quick snack and something that doesn't cost a lot of money then I would recommend grabbing a few cans of these from your local grocery store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
SpaghettiOs have been around for a long time and brings back good memories of my childhood. My mom would have this ready on cold winter days after school. It has that same classic taste. I like the pasta and sauce and my family does too. It makes a quick, little meal for work as I can put the can in my desk. The pull off can is very convenient and easy to open. I can just pour in a bowl and pop in the microwave. SpaghettiOs are a family favorite! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I received a free sample of Spaghettios from Tryit. I was curious to try it again after not having it for years. I grew up having Spaghettios as a special treat as a child. I had not had them in over 40 years. They were pretty much as I remembered. They would be good to have as a side with a meal occasionally. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The original SpaghettiOs need something more than just pasta and sauce. Some protein would make them a little better, but the sauce still leaves something to be desired. I was always a fan of Chef Boy Ardee ravioli as a kid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Who doesn't like Campbells SpaghettiOs. I know for sure kids do but I myself being an adult love them. My bf can't have them anymore, he found out he has celiac disease. He says he sure does miss the taste of them. Kids love the round noodles shapes. These are low in fat and very yummy. All you do is just reheat no cooking required. SpaghettiOs have been around for many generations I have no doubt they will still be here for many more. My only complaint is I wish they were gluten free so people with celiac could enjoy them as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
These Spaghettio's are great, love the small can, easy to carry anywhere, they taste just like they do in the bigger can, this is good size to keep on hand for a quick snack or just for the kids. They taste great as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I ate spaghettios all of the time growing up and the first bite took me right back to my childhood. I'm glad to know that the taste hasn't changed over the years and it's still a product I can count on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love Spaghettios, they are just an easy lunch for a busy day and I love that they are low fat and has vitamin A in it. it is so quick to make and it is delicious. I used to take care of kids and it would have saved me some trouble if I would have made it for them a couple of times for supper I know kids would love the Spaghettios and it is healthier than most of the canned goods. I just love the produt and will contiune buying it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

When my nieces & nephews come over this is so quick & easy, just heat & serve.They are all smiles & they so enjoy it.

Wow, SpaghettiOs are my favorite childhood lunchtime meal. The quality, taste, and convenience makes this product an excellent choice for lunchtime, or anytime, for that matter. They taste the same as when I was a child. I love it. My mother used to make these for me for lunchtime during the weekends or summertime. It was a staple. I highly recommend this product for anytime you want a tasty, convenient meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received a free sample of Campbell’s original Spaghettios from Tryit. I could not review it because the can came to my home very damaged. I did not taste the product because I was afraid that I would get sick from it because the can was so damaged. I would’ve liked to see if if was as good as I remembered from my childhood. I was very disappointed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The taste is the same and does bring back some memories but as an adult I wish the ingredients were better and fewer. As a once in a while snack no biggie but I don’t think I would want my kids to be eating this too often. But again it does bring back nostalgia of when I didn’t care how much salt was in the things I ate Lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Spaghettios have always been a favorite for my kids. We pretty much have eaten spaghettios growing up and they are just delicious. They have fun little o noodles, the tomato sauce is so good. The can even comes with a cool, fun design on it. They are quick to warm up, either on the stove or in the microwave. A good delicious quick meal for adults and kids, they are very appetizing. We all love Spaghettios, very nutritional also. I highly recommend to moms that have picky kids, who wouldnt want to eat some good spaghettios. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I grew up on Campbell's SpaghettiOs. My boys loved them. It'd been awhile since I've had any so I was looking forward to trying this. I should of cooked 2 can. The can went quick. Just enough tomato taste to make the sauce really tasty. The O's are flavored just enough. The SpaghettiOs are seasoned just right. Very easy to heat. I heated them up in a sauce pan. You could very easily put some in a bowl, cover it, and put into your microwave to heat. This will be a new staple in my cabinet. Can't wait to try the other kinds!!

A quick and easy meal that's a staple in my pantry. I add a little grated Parmesan cheese and serve with garlic bread. Classic taste from my childhood and still just as good.

There is nothing like having a good ole can of spaghetti O’s! It’s a quick meal with a sandwich or when the grandkids are over and want something fun to eat. We eat them cold or warm them up in the microwave. They taste great either way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Great for a quick, “go to meal.” Made this for my Grandkids with a grilled cheese. They loved it! I was pleasantly surprised that it still has the great flavor and packed with a lot of noodles. The sauce is creamy and has a good flavor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My kids love SoaghettiOs. This pasta meal is so easy to cook. The noodles taste excellent. The tomato sauce is the right consistency and does not turn runny when cooked.

Nothing screams childhood memories like spaghettiOs. I think you have to be under the age of 10 to really enjoy these. Once you grow up and have a taste of real food this simply doesn’t do the trick any longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Cambell's SpaghettiOs have always been a great go to meal for me. The grandkids love the shapes and the taste is always on point. They are simple to warm up and serve so I always keep some in the pantry. If you are feeling a bit hangry, these will get you back on track quickly. A great source of nutrients and vegetables with zero trans fat makes SpaghettiOs a win for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Whoever said Campbell's SpaghettiOs are just for kids has clearly never tried SpaghettiOs! SpaghettiOs in our household is our fun kid's choice main entree for dinner. We like to have our kids make the dinner selection and this is 100 percent of the time what they choose and mom and dad get to enjoy SpaghettiO's guilt free! Just as our kids do, we love the taste and the added bonus is the fact that our kids get some of their daily vegetables without them even knowing it and it is not even a budget buster for us. It is easy for our kids to prepare in minutes. Will always keep Campbell's SpaghettiO's on hand for our meals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I would have to say that the Campbells Spaghetti O's taste the same like they did when I was a kid years ago. I have always liked Spaghetti O's but tasting thing now just seemed like the same before. Dont get me wrong, they were still a good product but realy didnt see any real difference [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

As a mom of 4 this is great for my children to be able to make a quick lunch or dinner. My 7yr old son is the youngest and able to make his own. The taste is so yummy they'd eat them everyday and to be honest I love the flavor just as well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I haven’t had spaghetti-os in about 20 years. I forgot how good they taste. And now I have gotten my son into them. He LOVED them. So yummy. I have never seen a more excited child then when he got a big bowl of his sized spaghetti. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have eaten spaghettios since I was a kid, and these taste even better! The larger can helps to feed more people so it is much appreciated!! The design on the can was appealing to the eye as well! Overall I liked them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
As a kid, I really enjoyed SpaghettiO’s. I thought I’d give them another shot, and I wasn’t really a fan. They had sort of a metallic taste to them. They were still creamy, as always. But maybe my tastes have changed as an adult. I know kids still love them, though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I received this to try and I'm glad I did because it tastes like my childhood. It brings back memories and I am glad I am able to share them with my children. This is an easy meal for little ones or for a big kid. The larger can saves money and space in the shelves. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I haven't opened a can of SpaghettiOs since I was a kid , until the other day. I'm still a fan. The tomato sauce is mild and the rings are fun to eat. I will be buying a few cans to have in the house for those days that I want something fast that tastes just like I remember. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I just sat down and opened a can of spaghetti Os. Perfect size can for one persons lunch. I really enjoyed them. I really like that you do not need a can opener to open them. Makes it easier to take on the go with you. They were just as tasty as I remember them. Will be enjoying more of them in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My son loves this pasta. It is more like tomato soup with little pasta stars. Very yummy!
--------------------
My kids love this. Very tasty. I love that it's organic. Very easy to open, heat and eat!
--------------------
My kids love these! They are easy to prepare and have quality ingredients.
--------------------
My daughter is a picky eater and decided to buy this on a whim so she had some other varieties for her meals. She loves it and asked for more so I had to buy a few more cans. A little expensive for what you get but if she eats it then it's a win.
--------------------
Good quality for my kids. I hate the rates of these but my kids LOVE them. My son is also slightly allergic (skin) so he has to stay covered up
--------------------
This is the only soup I like and I would eat it every day if I could.
--------------------
Organic for my child. Great taste
--------------------
Chef Boyardee Beef Ravioli is so delicious I can't get enough! It makes for a great, quick meal and takes me back to such happy times. Thanks Chef Boyardee!
--------------------
What did you do to the beef ravioli. the pasta is so thick it is not good to eat. Iwillnot buy again. I used to eat but no more
--------------------
All my raviolis were melded together out of can. Sauce looked like blood coming out of the elevator in The Shining.
--------------------
I use to love this ravioli but the sauce has become watery with no flavor. I just can't.
--------------------
Anyone else here after googling if they changed their recipe? Please change it back the sauce tastes like ketchup.
--------------------
Used to love these as a kid. The sauce was thick! Now it’s so watery! It’s like eating raviolis in soup. No thanks.
--------------------
I've eaten this ravioli for 50 years or more - great comfort food, especially now in the pandemic - but now the sauce is so thin and watery, and there seem to be fewer raviolis - what a shame!!! I'd rather pay more for the old style food.
--------------------
Kids love it for either lunch/dinner!
--------------------
My husband is completely disappointed this is his favorite snack and all of a sudden it is a watery mess. He threw three cans away the other day because when he opened it it looks like water with grease floating in it. I don't know what you have done but you need to go back to the way it was. I will follow to see if it goes back to the old recipe otherwise I will not buy anymore because he doesn't like it.
--------------------
Bought a couple cans this past weekend and this is exactly as I remember. Not sure why the complaints about watery sauce, this can was perfect, thick sauce. Now the sodium levels are off the chart, 780mg per 282 grams serving size.
--------------------
Have eaten Chef Boyardee Ravioli since I was a child. Recently though, it seems like a completely different product and is not as enjoyable. Raviolis still taste okay, but the sauce to way too watery now. Please go back to the old recipe.
--------------------
I used to love Chef Boyardee canned lasagna, but lately the recipe has clearly changed. The sauce is so watery. It’s disappointing. Please change it back, as it’s been a favorite of mine for years and years.
--------------------
Just brought for grandkids. As they loved it in past. Seems you changed the sauce adding more water to save on cost. Sauce use to be thick. Now just water. What a shame.
--------------------
I used to love the beef ravioli but I hate the new formulation. The sauce is really watery and it seemed that there were fewer ravioli pieces. This was more like ravioli soup. Please bring the old formulation back.
--------------------
I'm no expert of Chef Boyardee ravioli, but I've eaten it enough times in my life to know that something is now WAY OFF with the tomato sauce. REALLY thin and watery. Something absolutely has changed...
--------------------
YO WHAT UP BOY CHEF??! YA ISH GOT ME TURNT ALL THE WAY UP! THANKS FOR KEEPING IT REAL ON THE FLIP SIDE FOR US OG HOMIES. ALL THESE OTHER HATERS AND PERPETRATORS ARE MAAAAAAAAD WIGGITY WIGGITY WHACK. NAW SAYING P.S. - IM TRYING TO GROW A SILLY STUPID STACH LIKE THE BOY CHEF. IS THAT OKAY?!?!
--------------------
Agree with the first post I read here! Did someone poor water in the pot and forget to stop? I love ravioli in it's thick sauce not colored water, please fix this issue quickly!
--------------------
I used to love ravioli from chef boy rd. Not any more. Now I’m trying to find off brands. Way to runny makes me sick. I have stopped buying it and every one I know is doing the same. This needs to change.
--------------------
I ate this as a kid growing up and it was good.I don't eat much processed food since I grew up,but when Covid hit I stocked up on canned foods as a backup to a shortage in the supply chain. I tried to eat a can today and it is awful, even with adding some spices and Parmesan cheese. This is nothing like it used to taste. i won't even buy anymore of this as a survival food.
--------------------
Others try to imitate the original but can't do it ! Keeping it "beefy."
--------------------
I bought a can a week ago, (haven't had them since I was a kid) I was very disappointed. The sauce was watery and I had to add cornstarch to thicken it up. I remember when the sauce was thick enough you didn't need a spoon, it would adhere to the ravioli. Will not buy again, for myself or my kids.
--------------------
i buy it almost everytime im at the store! i love it (:
--------------------
Bought cans of the lazania, and the first can was super watery. Thinking the first can was spoiled, I opened another can. The second can was super watery like the first can. It was like soup, so I threw both the cans out and made a sandwich. The dates on the cans were good until 2022, but I didn’t want to chance getting sick from the lazania soup. Won’t buy that again!
--------------------
What happened?? The sauce is essentially tomato flavored water and I'm not sure if there's even beef in the filling. I wasn't able to finish an entire bowl. Miss the quality of Chef Boyardee from the 90's/00's
--------------------
Why is ravioli and spaghetti and meatballs so watery now. What happened? I have literally resorted to shaking the cans before I buy. I good has little to no movement a bad can sloushes around like a can of soup. Please, fix this and become consistent. Very disappointing !
--------------------
A few months ago I mistakenly bought 4 cans of Ravioli in pasta sauce. It was horrible. I now have three cans on my shelf that I will never eat. Who makes the decision to no longer offer a classic product that many of us grew up on and substitute it with a product that is totally inedible. Whoever is in charge of making these decisions should be "canned". Chef Boyardee would be gagging in his grave if he had to eat this garbage. Bring back meat sauce!
--------------------
There's obviously a change in the product. The raviolis I just bought are in watered down soupy sauce. It tastes more like watered down Spaghettios. Are there less raviolis too? I've grinned and beared a lot of the subtle changes over the years, but if I'm going to have to get used to a "new" product, I might as well try different brands for once. Consistency is important. I don't want ravioli surprise...
--------------------
I used to eat these since the 80s and literally lived eating these during college in the 90s. I buy them from time to time bc it used to be so good but what happened???? There is absolutely NO flavor what so ever, it's getting worse every year to my shock and I'm just appalled as to who the heck is altering the recipe?? Don't tell me nothing has changed bc IT HAS. There is a reason why you guys produce canned goods bc there is that instant food flavor that may not be healthy but people gravitate towards canned foods bc of that flavor which used to be good but now you guys trying so hard to make it taste like it's homemade and I think that's where you have messed up. I am thoroughly disappointed and won't buy it again.
--------------------
Great product.Love some chef Boyardee Ravioli. But... would you consider it a soup or not?
--------------------
Got it for dad quickest fulfilling meal
--------------------
What happened to this product?! It used to be thick the ravioli used to be more firm now it's flavorless cheapened. Not buying it again
--------------------
I am a picky eater. I had eaten the Chef Boyardee ravioli almost every day for years. This was through middle school, high school, and most of college. I understand why recipes have to change, but I am very confused about what has happened in the past year or two. I have always eaten ravioli with the tomato and meat sauce. That's what it says in the description on this website. However, that is not the product that is available anymore. It is now ravioli with pasta sauce. Totally different taste, texture, nutrition, and packaging. You can see it in the image of this product! What is the difference? Why did you make the change? Why is there no information online to be found about this? Thanks for your time, a concerned ravioli fan.
--------------------
I bought 24 cans of this product additional to spaghetti and meatballs. The cans were under filled, and had poor flavor. The sauce is watery, salty, and lacks spice. Tastes like ketchup mixed with water, and pasta was nasty. Furthermore, the size reductions of the food content will leave you hungry. No longer a viable choice for the pantry, or emergency supplies. I suggest the board of directors focus more on quality and customer service before they find themselves without customers.
--------------------
Good amount of serving in each can! 
Easy to prepare! Delicious!
--------------------
The new recipe is super watery and really gross. The new sauce makes the pasta too soft and it comes out mushy. Will not buy any more !
--------------------
When my son tried the ravioli for the first time, he LOVED it! He was two years old at the time and my wife took a picture of him, half covered with sauce, grinning from ear to ear. It is one of my favorite pictures of him. He still loves them a year later.
--------------------
The can lists 320 calories in a whole can. I’m reading where 220 calories per serving with 2 servings per can. I want to ensure your can label is correct. BTW, love Chef Boyardee ravioli!!!
--------------------
I don't understand why the ravioli has to have so much sodium. Can't it have 2/3 less sodium?
--------------------
The new recipe is not good. The texture of the pasta is grainy and dry. The sauce is weak. Unfortunately we’ll be returning any remaining cans.
--------------------
I lived on this stuff growing up and over the years and now that you've changed the recipe is just plain FOWL!
--------------------
Most people have said they didn't like the new recipe but i think its a little better. I can eat cans of this stuff.
--------------------
I'm glad i googled, now I see I'm far from the only one who is completely baffled by this product. I lived on this stuff as a teenager and into my 20's, so cheap, easy and tasted good.
--------------------
Gelatinous rubbery clump of ravioli in a water puddle of âsauceâ. Opened a second can. Same. Used to eat this often. Threw it out. Wonât buy again until it is fixed. Canât believe this made it past any kind of QC process. You should be ashamed.
--------------------
There seems to be fewer raviolis. Used to be able to get one good size serving and a few more. Now the whole can makes one serving. The sauce covers the ravioli. As others have mentioned, sauce is watery. Looks like a soup now. Would recommend but with a warning.
--------------------
New recipe stinks. I will not buy again until you change it back.
--------------------
Whatever you guys changed with this new "no artificial colors,flavors,or preservatives" recipe has ruined the product. The texture of the ravioli pasta is grainy instead of smooth. The filling is dry and bland. Clearly indicate the consumer what version is which if you want to make a "healthy" option for people who want to eat this abomination.
--------------------
Hate the new recipe and sauce and also lowered calories never buying again just another pruduct cheapened
--------------------
I love most of the chefs products but this is awful. I mean, its bearable to eat, but I didn't really enjoy it to any extent.
--------------------
Formula appears different. It is very watery and lacks the same thick tasty sauce. Was one of my comfort foods ....not so much any more. Too bad
--------------------
its great and all but the sauce needs to change, its watery and slightly bland, i found out you can add a pinch of salt and will taste better but it doesn't resolve the fact that it is watery
--------------------
When I opened this can, I noticed the runny, watery sauce right away. There seems to be fewer ravioli in the can than previously. I had always had to pry them out with a fork; now they just pour out like soup. I still had an older can in my recycling bin, so I compared them. The whole can is now considered one serving instead of the previous two servings, and contains considerably fewer calories. The sauce is no longer meat sauce. So you're paying for less food in a disgusting watery sauce. I have eaten this for years and am really disappointed. I won't buy any more of this and sincerely hope you do not tamper with your other canned pastas. Store brands are looking better to me now.
--------------------
The ravioli is not good. The sauce has no flavor and is way too peppery. I have tried all the different ones and the taste is the same. The sauce used to be flavorful and not peppery. I used to love it, but now really cannot stand it. It is way different from how it used to taste. The spaghetti and meatballs are still ok. Please go back to the way it was.
--------------------
Iâve never had any issues eating Chef Boyardee raviolis or spaghetti. Kind of weird how it taste way better when itâs cold but when you heat it up the flavor changes.
--------------------
As other reviewers have noted the beef ravioli recipe has been changed recently and not for the better. The new sauce is drastically different, watery and lacking the richness of the product I've been purchasing for decades. The ravioli themselves are bland. Of course Chef B was never a gourmet product but it had a certain "comfort food" factor and kids mostly loved it. I noticed it was on sale at a local grocer so I stocked up yesterday. I'm embarrassed to serve this new recipe version to friends and family and doubt I'll purchase more if/when my current stock is gone. Very sad and pointless decision by Conagra accountants. also not happy that they'll charge me 300% more for a can of their new "throwback" recipe.
--------------------
I always loved this stuff but what in the world happened to the sauce? Its so watery and nasty now. Never buying this stuff again. Just another product cheapened.

The sauce tastes different for the worse kinda watered down. Meat in the ravioli is mushy not like ground beef. We could not eat it!!! 10 cans i don't know what to do with.

Back when I was in my 20s I worked the graveyard shift in a supermarket. I would buy chef Boyardee ravioli and then I would heat it up in the can under hot water. Iâm in my 60s now and I still buy it from time to time for a snack and still enjoy those Ravioliâs
--------------------
I prepared Chef Boyardee Ravioli as an after school snack. It was quick and easy to prepared. I warmed the ravioli in a pan as directed and it turned out tasty as a quick snack. The ravioli was meaty, the sauce was flavorful and didn't taste canned. I recommend this product as a quick snack or lunch. I would buy this product in the future.

I was enjoying a can of ravioli for lunch when I found a piece of rubber. It was absolutely disgusting. I noticed it was rubber when I pulled it OUT of MY MOUTH. It had a really awful taste. I will never eat another can of this again
--------------------
The taste is just not as flavorful as it used to be. The sauce is too thin or something.

I used to eat this religiously as a child, it was one of my favorite after school snacks. Having it 20+ years later, it still tastes the same and brings back so many memories. The pasta is a soft pillow filled with meat. The meat is tender and flavorful. The red sauce is not my favorite, but still tastes good. Overall, this is something I will continue to eat.

I have been eating chef Boyardee since I was a kid, and while I've gone back and forth on other shapes, I always seem to go back to the Beef Ravioli, I use to love both beef and cheese ravioli, but I do not like the cheese anymore, and I am glad you bought back the original lasagna.

Great option for picky teens who need a quick, easy to make meal.

The chef does it again.

I heat it in a saucepan. It really takes me back to my childhood.  It doesn't taste anything like spaghetti and meatballs, but I love it.  Make sure you get a "meatball" with every bite.

good food fast for microwave. why i put 4 star was missing 1 can.

Yummy tasty good food ready for microwave I love this!

I mean it’s spaghettios so it is what it is but it’s nice to get them in a 4-pack

I am 32 years old, and I still love a good 'ol can of Spaghettios. I really do. I know it's not the 'healthiest' meal choice, but when you are in a pinch, it is so good. Plus, it is a really great comfort food. Kids and adults love them alike! My kids like the ones with meatballs in it, I like the one without meatballs.

My daughter loves spaghettiOs. They have a nice mild flavor and are perfectly soft for my toddler. My daughter doesn’t like super bold flavors so these are perfect for her.

I received a 22.4 ounce can of spaghettios to try. The can was so big and I didn't realize they even made them this size. I was impressed that it fed myself and my son and no need for another can. The ratio of spaghettios to sauce is spot on and perfect. The taste was great just like I would expect from Campbells. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love these spaghettio’s they are just how I remembered them as a kid. If you are busy and you need something quick to feed the kids this is the way to go !

Campbell's Spaghettios are a classic favorite, reminding me of after school in elementary. i love the spaghetti taste and the o's are fun to look at and make me happy.

SpaghettiOs have been around for a long time and brings back good memories of my childhood. My mom would have this ready on cold winter days after school. It has that same classic taste. I like the pasta and sauce and my family does too. It makes a quick, little meal for work as I can put the can in my desk. The pull off can is very convenient and easy to open. I can just pour in a bowl and pop in the microwave. SpaghettiOs are a family favorite! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received a free sample of Spaghettios from Tryit. I was curious to try it again after not having it for years. I grew up having Spaghettios as a special treat as a child. I had not had them in over 40 years. They were pretty much as I remembered. They would be good to have as a side with a meal occasionally. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The original SpaghettiOs need something more than just pasta and sauce. Some protein would make them a little better, but the sauce still leaves something to be desired. I was always a fan of Chef Boy Ardee ravioli as a kid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Who doesn't like Campbells SpaghettiOs. I know for sure kids do but I myself being an adult love them. My bf can't have them anymore, he found out he has celiac disease. He says he sure does miss the taste of them. Kids love the round noodles shapes. These are low in fat and very yummy. All you do is just reheat no cooking required. SpaghettiOs have been around for many generations I have no doubt they will still be here for many more. My only complaint is I wish they were gluten free so people with celiac could enjoy them as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Wow, SpaghettiOs are my favorite childhood lunchtime meal. The quality, taste, and convenience makes this product an excellent choice for lunchtime, or anytime, for that matter.

I received a free sample of Campbell’s original Spaghettios from Tryit. I could not review it because the can came to my home very damaged.

The taste is the same and does bring back some memories but as an adult I wish the ingredients were better and fewer. As a once in a while snack no biggie but I don’t think I would want my kids to be eating this too often. But again it does bring back nostalgia of when I didn’t care how much salt was in the things I ate Lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Spaghettios have always been a favorite for my kids. We pretty much have eaten spaghettios growing up and they are just delicious. They have fun little o noodles, the tomato sauce is so good. The can even comes with a cool, fun design on it. They are quick to warm up, either on the stove or in the microwave. A good delicious quick meal for adults and kids, they are very appetizing. We all love Spaghettios, very nutritional also. I highly recommend to moms that have picky kids, who wouldnt want to eat some good spaghettios. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I grew up on Campbell's SpaghettiOs. My boys loved them. It'd been awhile since I've had any so I was looking forward to trying this. I should of cooked 2 can. The can went quick. Just enough tomato taste to make the sauce really tasty. The O's are flavored just enough. The SpaghettiOs are seasoned just right. Very easy to heat. I heated them up in a sauce pan. You could very easily put some in a bowl, cover it, and put into your microwave to heat. This will be a new staple in my cabinet. Can't wait to try the other kinds!!

Easy, quick meal and kids love it! Easy to heat up and easy to serve. It heats evenly in microwave. The ratio of noodles to sauce in this product is just right. Campbell’s canned pastas are a must have in our pantry! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Campbell’s SpaghettiOs are the best canned pasta available. The taste is delicious, they are very easy to make, fun to eat and kids love them. When you want something tasty and easy I recommend SpaghettiOs. You won’t be disappointed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love eating these as a snack or meal. They’re super yummy and they are low fat which makes me happy. They are very convenient for me to carry for my lunch at work and as a quick meal or snack at home. I love how easy it is to heat them up and I can be eating them within minutes! I highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love this, it was just enough for me for lunch. The spaghetti is well cooked, not mushy, the sauce is tasty. I wish the sauce were a bit thicker so it sticks to the pasta better, but the taste makes up for it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I tried Campbell's Spaghetti Canned Pasta recently and I was very satisfied with this product.The taste and packaging are good,the taste is not spicy,quite delicious.I recommend this product to customers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I received a free can of Campbell's Spaghetti-O's from Try It Sampling and they were great! I've loved them since I was a child, my children love them, as well as my husband! Its nice to eat something that still tastes basically the same and is good and good for you, or not terrible at least! Keep up the good work Campbells! Can't wait for my grandkids to try and like them as well one day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
There is nothing like having a good ole can of spaghetti O’s! It’s a quick meal with a sandwich or when the grandkids are over and want something fun to eat. We eat them cold or warm them up in the microwave. They taste great either way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Great for a quick, “go to meal.” Made this for my Grandkids with a grilled cheese. They loved it! I was pleasantly surprised that it still has the great flavor and packed with a lot of noodles. The sauce is creamy and has a good flavor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My kids love SoaghettiOs. This pasta meal is so easy to cook. The noodles taste excellent. The tomato sauce is the right consistency and does not turn runny when cooked. These are super easy to heat up on the stove or in the microwave. This also fills up my active kids when nights where we have a busy schedule and not a lot of time for dinner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I received this as a free sample and it was pretty tasty. My husband actually enjoys these and takes them for his lunch occasionally. I like how the serving has your daily dose of veggies in it as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Nothing screams childhood memories like spaghettiOs. I think you have to be under the age of 10 to really enjoy these. Once you grow up and have a taste of real food this simply doesn’t do the trick any longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Cambell's SpaghettiOs have always been a great go to meal for me. The grandkids love the shapes and the taste is always on point. They are simple to warm up and serve so I always keep some in the pantry. If you are feeling a bit hangry, these will get you back on track quickly. A great source of nutrients and vegetables with zero trans fat makes SpaghettiOs a win for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Whoever said Campbell's SpaghettiOs are just for kids has clearly never tried SpaghettiOs! SpaghettiOs in our household is our fun kid's choice main entree for dinner. We like to have our kids make the dinner selection and this is 100 percent of the time what they choose and mom and dad get to enjoy SpaghettiO's guilt free! Just as our kids do, we love the taste and the added bonus is the fact that our kids get some of their daily vegetables without them even knowing it and it is not even a budget buster for us. It is easy for our kids to prepare in minutes. Will always keep Campbell's SpaghettiO's on hand for our meals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I would have to say that the Campbells Spaghetti O's taste the same like they did when I was a kid years ago. I have always liked Spaghetti O's but tasting thing now just seemed like the same before. Dont get me wrong, they were still a good product but realy didnt see any real difference [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The small can provides the perfect single serving which is very convenient to take to work. The recipe tastes just like I remember from years back. A nice tomato taste that works well with bread and butter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

As a mom of 4 this is great for my children to be able to make a quick lunch or dinner. My 7yr old son is the youngest and able to make his own. The taste is so yummy they'd eat them everyday and to be honest I love the flavor just as well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I haven’t had spaghetti-os in about 20 years. I forgot how good they taste. And now I have gotten my son into them. He LOVED them. So yummy. I have never seen a more excited child then when he got a big bowl of his sized spaghetti. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have eaten spaghettios since I was a kid, and these taste even better! The larger can helps to feed more people so it is much appreciated!! The design on the can was appealing to the eye as well! Overall I liked them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
As a kid, I really enjoyed SpaghettiO’s. I thought I’d give them another shot, and I wasn’t really a fan. They had sort of a metallic taste to them. They were still creamy, as always. But maybe my tastes have changed as an adult. I know kids still love them, though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I received this to try and I'm glad I did because it tastes like my childhood. It brings back memories and I am glad I am able to share them with my children. This is an easy meal for little ones or for a big kid. The larger can saves money and space in the shelves. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I haven't opened a can of SpaghettiOs since I was a kid , until the other day. I'm still a fan. The tomato sauce is mild and the rings are fun to eat. I will be buying a few cans to have in the house for those days that I want something fast that tastes just like I remember. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I just sat down and opened a can of spaghetti Os. Perfect size can for one persons lunch. I really enjoyed them. I really like that you do not need a can opener to open them. Makes it easier to take on the go with you. They were just as tasty as I remember them. Will be enjoying more of them in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
my son used to love these but now they seem more watery than before
--------------------
Today I purchased a 40 oz can of Mini Ravioli as I was in need of a little comfort food. Instead of enjoying the ravioli what I recieve3d was a 40 oz can of sauce with only 7 mini raviolis... It was nothing more than a can of sauce.. I am very disappointed. Please do not give me the "Sorry you had this experience excuse"" Excuses are like noses everyone has one....Fix the problem or maybe you think that the media is going to ignore your lack of quality control... Someone needs to be watching..
--------------------
Having trouble finding mini ravioli on the store shelves these days, I’ve been buying the very large cans and all of them have gone straight in the garbage as it’s been separated and disgusting.
--------------------
Oye, Chef. No bueno. I remember the good times , when the sauce was thick and you could find the Italian sausage ravioli anywhere. Please cook the people what they want. ey ye ye
--------------------
A great, quick, at home lunch option. Sometimes when I want a little more kick, add a dash of cayenne pepper when hearing up on the stove...try it, you may like it that way too!
--------------------
i bought this yesterday and its amazing a very good go to meal
--------------------
I purchased 4 large cans of Mini Ravioli & the ravioli looks pasty, without meat as in pic on can, sauce is watery with no flavor. Will not purchase again & I have ate this for over 45 years as a go to staple.
--------------------
This was a great price, and it was so easy to have it shipped.
--------------------
Same great like when I was a kid. stocked up on these for hurricane season.
--------------------
Good amount of serving in each can! 
Easy to prepare! I cooked ground beef and mixed it with the mini ravioli, delicious!
--------------------
I normally eat Chef Boyardee several times a week. The new recipe has replaced the sauce with watery slop. The new watery sauce also makes the pasta too soft, now ita just a mushy watery mess. Please go back to the old recipe!! I will not be buying these again.
--------------------
Loved as a child & still love today, came in handy during virus lockdown, all Chef Boyardee products are very good.
--------------------
I am very disappointed with this product! I am trying to keep track of calories and the can says 320 calories but when scanning the bar code & reading the nutrition facts here the calories are 220.
--------------------
I will ONLY eat the mini ravioli brand. I don't like the regular-sized ravioli, to me, it has a different taste. I grew up on the mini-sized ravioli and as an adult, I LOVE finding these on sale. I can easily have a whole week of dinners with just eating this and be perfectly satisfied. If I'm feeling fancy, I'll combine it with Sweet Hawaiian Rolls to help lap up the remaining sauce. Then it's even a bigger party in my tummy!!!
--------------------
bought one can. didn't bother heating it up just ate it out of there with a spoon. nothing fancy, just basic, straightforward tastiness. will buy again.

My daughter is super picky and I was nervous about her trying Chef Boyardee. Luckily, we were pressed for time, and this was perfect to just heat up on the stove. I gave her just a small bowl at first, and she seriously DOWNED it - lol! She then asked for more, and she ended up eating the entire can of ravioli! Thanks for the snack, Chef Boyardee - she loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Chef Boyardee Mini Beef Ravioli is a great, easy lunch option. I had not tried it again since I was a kid, but this was a great lunch option to share with my son. He loved it and it brought back great memories for me. Still easy to prepare, same Chef Boyardee flavor and plenty of ravioli in each can. I will make this a regular on our grocery lists the weather is getting colder and its a nice hot lunch or easy last minute dinner option. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The mini ravioli are tasty, but they are just too small. They sort of disintegrated as soon as I picked it up with a fork. It has really good flavor, but the tomato sauce overpowered the ravioli at times. When I did taste the beef, it was so savory that I wanted more after I was done eating. I was aware of Chef Boyardee before trying this product, and I would try this product again if the raviolis were made slightly bigger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Was looking forward to this. Usually when they go back to the old ways it's better then what we have now. That was not the case with this. It tastes nothing like the one made today.

I revived a coupon from Viewpoints for a free can of the Throwback variety of Chef Boyardee, in exchange for my review.

I've tried plenty of other brands ie. Campbell soup, SpaghettiOs, Wolf Brand Chilis and many more. I always always beg for my can of Chef Boyardee. My fav was always the beef ravioli either in mini or regular size and what i would love to do is add black pepper; i love my food spicy! You've gotta let your inner child & haha your children of course try this brand if you havent. It's a game changer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Chef Boyardee Mini Beef Ravioli is very tasty and satisfying. I usually bring a can at least once a week to work with me to eat on my lunch break. It comes with the tab on the can so I don't need a can opener to open which is convenient. It's hearty and doesn't leave me feeling hungry. There's just the right amount of sauce and the perfect amount of filling in each ravioli for me. They taste great. They're low in calories for anyone counting calories. Even my pickiest kid loves them. It's one of my go to meals when I don't feel like cooking. I highly recommend these raviolis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It had lots of yummy rich tomato sauce and the mini raviolis were stuffed with lots of tender meat to satisfied my appetite. It's a deliciously quick easy way to eat a fulfilling meal or have a snack. Chef Boyardee Mini Raviolis are definitely one of my favorites.

I've been purchasing Chef Boyardee for years and will continue doing so. I can't find any other brand like them because they're uncomparable. They truly make great food products to eat. My whole family eats Chef Boyardee Mini Raviolis because they are so good. I recommend it to anyone who wants a fast easy yummy meal.
--------------------
Great for a quick meal or snack in a few minutes and something the kids will enjoy too. I've always loved the brand. Quality products and reasonably priced especially if you are on a budget. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My kids and I really enjoyed this product! I hadn't had Chef Boyardee in a long time and was pleasantly surprised. It was flavorful and my kids loved it. I also appreciated that it had no preservatives or artificial flavors. Would eat again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My picky kid loves this￼! I finally was able to convince her to try the raviolis￼. I grew up with Chef Boyardee spaghetti and meatballs￼ and my mom always thanked God that I at least would eat that! lol￼
--------------------
i was given this as apart of my hurricane relief package at school. I can tell you I WAS MOST DEFINITELY RELIEVED. 10/10
--------------------
people have asked me before, they say "is this food?" I can indeed confirm, this is food.
--------------------
My friends bring it to school pretty often so I thought, "Eh, what the heck, I'll try it." and I have to say, pretty good! I'm only a 1st grader so I don't know much about nutrition or anything but my friend Kyle says it's healthy. The cups themselves are of a good size and I appreciate that the top pops off easy. My hands aren't that strong and I can open them without my mommy to help me. This does frighten me though, as I worry that when I'm riding my bike one of them might fall out on the ground and spill out. Other than that the packaging is quite well made. Chef boyardee ravioli tastes good too! I remember when I used to live in Italy for 3 days, my uncle made a tasty ravioli. Now he's not allowed around us anymore but that's okay because everytime I eat the ravioli i'm reminded of him. While I am allergic to peanuts this is ravioli and therefore doesn't contain peanuts. That makes me happy because I don't like peanuts. Whenever we go out to eat a restaurants I always sneak a cup of Chef Boyardee ravioli into my bag with my crayons so that I don't have to eat the food at the restaurant. In fact, I eat nothing but chef boyardee ravioli. It is great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! To be honest, I haven't ate or drank anything but chef boyardee ravioli. So shoutout to my friend Abby for suggesting I eat chef boyardee beefaroni. Woo!
--------------------
I'm very upset that my chef boyardeee big time rush code is invalid. But overall very tasty ravioli even when it's 4 years expired.

These are just great to keep on the shelf for that snack when you don't want to go to a lot of trouble. They don't splatter all over your microwave with the tops and they actually taste good!

impeccable so amazing divine splendid delicious sobgood

My kids will not eat any other product but this item has been shortage everywhere and I see I am not the only person saying this...what is the reason for the shortage in supply?
--------------------
My daughter loves these, this is actually the only ones she will eat. We have been having an extremely hard time finding this particular kind.
--------------------
My 7-year-old and 14-year-old sons liked this, but my 2-year-old daughter didn't. The meatballs taste good, and the noodles and sauce are okay. I think my husband even eats these sometimes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I'm always on the lookout for quick and healthy food for me and my son. He generally eats anything but he really loves pasta with tomato sauce. I got this to try it out and he loves it. He has fun playing with the numbers and letters and it makes it easy to help him learn at the same time. To my own surprise, I ended up liking it also. It brought me back to when I was a kid and ate the same type of food. I will be adding this to our normal pick ups for pantry food. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I remember a time when I was young. A time when my mom would open a can of Chef Boyardee and heat it up in the microwave for me to eat. She would place the bowl down in front of me and I would just about lick the bowl clean. Chef Boyardee meatballs were my favorite thing ever. Unfortunately, time has not been kind to this brand or its products. The sauce takes on all the flavors of the aluminum can it comes in, and the pasta is mushy. Sad to say that the Chef Boyardee bubble has been popped. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is such a fun meal to heat up especially when you are in a hurry. Just heat it up in a bowl and serve. My grandson loved it! It has no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. It was fun to pick out the different numbers and letters. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My kids absolutely love anything made by Chef Boyardee! The Mini ABC's and 123's with Meatballs is no exception. We've tried other store brands and they don't compare. There is a reason that Chef Boyardee products are a favorite with kids and even adults. We do buy Chef Boyardee on a regular basis. It's easy to warm up and delicious for the kids.I buy this particular flavor along with others on a regular basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The kids enjoy eating this. Pros: Cooks quickly and easily. Cons: Very sweet sauce I made this for my preschool aged kids. They liked it enough to eat it. The shapes kept them entertained and the tiny meatballs were cute and just the right size for them. I tasted it, as I haven't had Chef Boyardee in many, many years, I was surprised by how sweet the sauce tasted, but otherwise it was fine. I myself wouldn't eat it, but I'd buy it for an occasional quick and easy lunch for the kids. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am a busy mom of 4 kids so anytime I can find a quick and easy food option, I'm excited! My kids love getting to choose their own variety of Chef Boyardee and it's easy enough to open and cook themselves. Mom win!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It doesn't matter if you're two or forty. Chef Boyardee is just one of those childhood classics that can completely satisfy your lunch time, after school or dinner cravings. Tasty & convenient. Packed full of flavor. What's not to love? My daughter actually had the pleasure of trying out the ABC's 123's. Her favorite part was the mini meatballs. She loved the flavor and said that one can was the perfect amount to fix her after school hunger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This brought back memories of being a kid. The taste was still the same as it use to be. I would definitely recommend trying it. It was hard to find but I think it was worth the time. Will be buying more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

First time I tried this Chef Boyardee pasta sauce and I would say the experience was good. I find the taste bland but my little girl loved the taste of it. I like the idea of the pasta shapes and the meatballs, taste great too! It is less effort because of it's easy open can and easy to prepare. I liked that it has no preservatives, no artificial flavors and colors. My husband and I, find the taste a little bland since he used to a bit savory taste. I would still recommend this as this is s really easy preparation snack or meal for kids. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I got the Chef Boyardee Mini ABC's and 123's with Meatballs Can. I like that it has no preservativeso, no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, and the can has no BPA liner making the food very safe for a developing child. The Meatballs and pasta are small in size, making it easier to feed a small child, no cutting needed, including the meatballs. The pasta is in the shape of the whole alphabet and all the numbers so you can reinforce the alphabet and numbers to a small child. You can even spell out words. The meal is tasty and not spicy, perfect for delicate tongues. As an adult I would like more flavor it tasted a little bland to me. but again this is made for kids. I have been eating Chef Boyardee all my life, it was one of the first things I used to cook or heat up as a child. Now you do not need a can opener, the top just pulls off. It pulls off safely and not really sharp as well as the can. Then I just emptied the can into a microwave safe bowl, covered it with a paper towel and heated it for 90 seconds or a minute and half. Then it was ready to eat. You can also heat up stove top as well. I would recommend trying this as a meal or snack for your child. they will like it.

I grew up eating Chef Boyardee as a kid, but over the years, the taste & quality have changed. It's just not as good as I remember. This time I tried the mini ABCs & 123s with Meatballs. The pasta texture is good & the shapes would be fun & educational for kids. The sauce was lacking in flavor & there was just too much of it. The meatballs tasted ok, but they didn't wow me. Overall, it's not bad as a convenient lunch once in awhile, but I wouldn't buy these regularly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The can of ravioli was the best I ever had from a can. The classic receipe made it taste closer to hand made ravioli than ever before. Great taste and texture [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received the Mini ABC's & 123's with Meatballs Can to try for free. I was surprised how many meatballs are in the can. It's great. It tasted good too. It's quick to make if you're busy and don't have a lot of time. My son loved it! I will purchase this product again. I recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Cambells is my favorite pasta soup brand. I liked the texture and flavor of the pasta and tomato sauce. I ate like half the can and saved the rest for another meal. I like the mario shaped pasta noodles. You can eat it cold or hot. I ate it warmed up. I will buy more in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The little one thoroughly enjoyed these Campbell's spaghettios. The excitement was all in the characters from Super Mario Bros. I wasn't sure how much was getting eaten versus identifying the characters. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My sons love this. It has one of their favorite charaters. They said it tatsed so goood. Something that is quick for a after school snack. or a quick lunch. Just an old favorite. Just the right amount to keep the kids full for a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this about a month ago & I didn't like it at all. The tomato sauce was bland as were the meatballs. I would've much preferred a little more flavor to convince me to buy this product again. I will try another type, but not this one again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

These taste great for a quick easy meal or a snack. It’s also good for the picky eaters in my house. My kids loved the shape of Super Mario and really enjoyed the meatballs. It satisfies some food groups. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My husband loves SpaghettiO's, so much, that he couldn't wait for me to take a picture of the can, so I could post a review! I was waiting to serve the Super Mario Bros. to our Grandchildren, but Grandpa got to the can and took it to work first. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My boys adored the mario shapes while eating and I feel that it made them eat it more. The texture of the sauce and pasta was great. The flavor was good and not too salty.

I received a 15.6 ounce can of Campbells Super Mario bros shaped spaghettios with meatballs to try. I loved how fun these were to eat. I found all the characters in the can and was happy to see that. The spaghettios are bigger than the standard O shaped ones and had a nice texture. The meatballa were perfect size and tasted yummy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
We love Campbell’s spaghettiOs products and the Mario Bro’s shaped pasta with meatballs did not disappoint! They have the same great flavor but shaped in my children’s favorite character. The meatballs are always great and the pasta too. The cook time was just perfect for heating. The sauce did seem a little watery but that was ok ad didn’t effect the taste any. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Same taste and flavor of the regular spaghettieOs but more fun to eat especially for the minions. Not a big fan of the meatballs. They have a weird texture to them. Besides that it's a perfect quick meal for the minions after school. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

These are great to have on stock in the pantry for when you don't feel like cooking. Taste is good overall and preparation is as easy as you want it to be. Can't go wrong with the classic Spaghettio's and Meatballs on a rainy day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

These were great. Who doesn’t love them some spaghettios?! My kiddos liked the fun shapes and the meatballs were perfectly bite sized. These are such an easy lunch to pop in the microwave and guaranteed to be eaten up every time! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Our family's go to easy to fix dinner, when I have no time to cook. So many different varieties .My kids and grand kids would probably eat it almost every day if I would let them. Spaghettios is not expensive, so easy to prep and has veggies in it and tastes so yummy.( packed with 9 grams of protein and 20 % of daily vegetables per 1 cup) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I tasted this product after receiving it recently. Not as good as I hoped for, but good enough for a quick lunch with some garlic toast. Not sure what ingredients are in the meatballs, but they could taste better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
As my kiddos were out visiting friends, my eight year old niece came to spend some time with me. She was very excited to see these on the counter & wanted them for lunch. We popped them open & I helped her warm them in the microwave (she loves to be as independent as possible). The Mario brothers shapes made me smile as I am a video game/classic game player. The character shapes excited her too as I have introduced her to Mario paint & a few other games, so she was familiar with almost all the characters. I didn't get any pics before or after cooking because she was so excited to see the fun shapes & make her own lunch haha. I like that there is some vegetables & that she couldn't tell the difference too! They have the same flavor I was used to as a child in my opinion. Her only request was that I added a few shakes of black pepper & mix it in when they were warm enough. The can had a good amount of mini meatballs & it filled her right up.

I received an example of the super Mario spaghettios about 2 weeks ago. they were very delicious, and it was awesome having a different kinda off noodle, such as the shapes and stuff. I was also able to share them with kids, who seemed to love them, and the shape as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Pleasant mild sauce suitable for younger children. Plenty of meat balanced nicely with sauce.Although precooked be sure to heat as this enhances the flavor.Our children love the shaped Past and have asked for us to purchase more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My kiddo loves this because of the cartoon printed on the label and the shaped pasta. The sass is just as yummy as the original but the cartoon shapes make it even more appealing to kids (and some adults)! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I liked the small pasta, but didn't care for the small meatballs. The sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking, but all in all I would eat it again. The portion was enough to fill my hunger and easy to heat up in the microwave. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Tastes just as good as any Spaghetti-O product ice ever eaten and I'm a big Nintendo buff so I really appreciated the Super Mario shaped pasta. It was fun and delicious.

The kids around here just love Campbell's® SpaghettiOs® Super Mario Bros.® Shaped Pasta with Meatballs, 15.6 oz. Ilove that they are healthy for them.

I used to love spaghetti o's so did my two kids. But these are more watered down.. I don't know why they did this maybe a bad batch? But i do love how they have regular spaghetti o's with the other noodles the mario bros. My kids ate the meatballs and some of the noodles but the consistency of the tomato sauce is very watered down not as thick as before?.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

tasty good food for microwave.
--------------------
My 5 year old is a picky eater, but he LOVES Mario. I got this to try to get him to eat something besides chicken. It actually worked! He saw Mario and went nuts. He and his sister split the can, both liked it. I thought it tasted terrible, but it only matters if your kids eat it, right?
--------------------
l love Campbell's soups and this Campbell's® Chunky™ Chili Mac Soup, isn't any different. It really tastes like a soup version of chili, a lot more broth, but enough beans and beef, small amount of pasta. There is no heat, yet it still tastes like chili. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I absolutely loved this “soup,” it was thicker so it reminded me more of a casserole or a stew. It had the perfect mix of all the ingredients and satisfied my need for warm comfort food! I shared a single bite with my hubby and he loved it too. I haven’t found it in the stores near me lately but I will buy in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

--------------------
So many good things to say about this soup! I say it's Chili but don't want to get people mad. It's good on its own but so delicious on some white rice or a baked potato! It's cornbread and cracker friendly without losing any of that great taste. I usually eat two cans of it in one sitting. It's a must for everyone to try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Tasted very delicious and interesting with the combination of flavors. It was very easy to prepare and also convenient for two or three servings. One of Campbell’s best food items to have for either lunch or dinner [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is my new favorite. I tried it and loved it so much I ran to the store to stock up on it . Even my picky kids love it. I love that it’s chunky so you actually taste the meat in it. It doesn’t taste like it comes from a can . It taste like it would be homemade. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I found this soup to be very good. The amount of meat and noodles made it very interesting mixture. I found it easy to make in the microwave. The sauce was smooth and flavorful. I poured it over hotdogs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My first reaction was excitement - that sizzle it makes when it hits the pan oozing out of that aluminum can! My first bite was misleading so I took another and suddenly realized ... this was not soup, nor chili. I couldn’t put my finger on it but I have had canned chili (not of a name brand) that tastes way better. I love chili Mac up until this, not for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This chili Mac soup is really rich in flavor. It was easy to make. I used this soup as a dip for movie night. It was an interesting way to eat it. It’s full of beef, beans and pasta and not watery, which is a plus. It fills you up quick too. The only con is that it’s very high in sodium. It’s like a fast food meal. So I don’t think it’s healthy to eat that regularly. But for a fun treat, it’s perfect! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

--------------------
This chilli Mac is hearty and thick. It's a great portion size for a full meal. The flavor is good, but the tomato flavor is a bit strong; tastes more like macaroni in tomato sauce instead of chili. Expected a bit more spices or seasoning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Who don't like chilli and macaroni? Well say no more as this delish blend of both is the absolute bomb!!! A nice rich bold tomato flavor along with the chilli and noodles make an awesome combination, beef,noodles and a tomato based sauce make this a perfect lunch time snack or even dinner if you like. Easy to make too all you do is open, heat and serve, great portion for one or share if you want!!

I was sent this a a free sample. I had gone out with the kids, I found the can of the Chunky Chili Mac Soup on my counter opened. I asked my husband who ate the can of soup, I had left on the counter and he admitted he did. So my review is based on his views. He detailed his review to me. Firstly, he stated that the lid was easy to remove, Then he heated the soup to his liking. After he tasted, he said “ I love this Soup.’ He said it was full of flavor and contained lots of meat and noodles. I still can’t believe he ate my soup. That’s fine because we agreed that we need a case of this soup [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Although the chilli mac Campbells soup is not my favorite mix of foods I have to say it is not that bad. For a canned chilli I was expecring it to be bland but to my surprise it was flavorful and hearty. Although it is not simething I would regularly buy it is definitely a meal that others would enjoy. Overall an average product.xa [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This Campbell's® Chunky™ Chili Mac Soup, 18.8 oz. tasted so good! It had plenty of meat in it. The meat to noodle ratio was good. The soup was very flavorful.

So my family loves the Campbell soups. Even this one was ok. Not one of our favorites but was alright. Out of the four of us we split on our likes so 50/50. I would use this one if making two different soups. Which I do sometimes cause I have to use two cans to feed my family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I had never tried the chili mac flavor before. I was looking for a flavor I would like with a lot of protein and this had both. I wasn't really sure about having the pasta with beans in it, but this was great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Combining chili and pasta, it's deliciously matched. This soup is so flavorful, it's like a party in your mouth. Tender beef, chili sauce/soup, beans, and pasta. What a great combination. Can be served as a side or as a meal. Hearty and filling. I think this is my new favorite soup. Campbell's knows how to make soup delicious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The can is easy to open, and the instructions on how to heat it are clear. It tastes good, and is a full meal that works for most people and kids. It has beans, meat, pasta, and tomato sauce. It will last a year or so since it is canned, and could be usefull for people who travel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I really enjoyed the flavor & taste of this Chili Mac soup. It's super hearty with a lot of meat, beans and elbow macaroni noodles. It was one of the very few times that what I saw on the outside of the can matched what was inside it. I added just abit of shredded cheese and sour cream to mine to add extra heartiness, I liked that I didn't have to season it or add any spices as it had just the right amount with every bite to satisfy my whole family-even my very picky 2 year old loved eating it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Not a fan of the chili at all. I got this bc chef boyardee chilli Mac is hard to find. There's no comparison this is tangy and weird not like chilli I've eaten.
--------------------
My husband loves this soup! He says it's filling, good flavor, quality ingredients, easy to heat up, and doesn't give him heartburn like most tomato-based foods. What's not to love?
--------------------
Italian wedding style soup is one of my favorites, so I am glad to have this healthy, hearty version by Campbell's Well Yes! It has a fresher flavor than many other brands.
--------------------
Easy to use and tastes really good. Cheaper than some of the other brands too which is always a good thing. Will buy again.
--------------------
I really like this Italian Wedding. It's healthier for you, but doesn't lack flavor. You wouldn't even know the meatballs are made from turkey without reading the can. It's flavorful, and filling. It's a perfect healthy version of this classic soup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is one of my favorite types of soup and normally canned soup doesnt come close to the way it usually tastes but this one sure does. Consistently, ingredients and flavor are all there. Well done!
--------------------
Upon opening the soup, it had that canned food smell, not bad, like ravioli smell.. I heated it on the stove top. Quick and easy. Tastes delicious. Very salty, if there was a lower sodium option that would be awesome. I enjoy the fact that this soup is 13g protein. Not sure how that compares to other Italian style soups but they have it on the label so when in a hurry it stands out nicely. I personally dont buy canned soup on the regular, but I would try this one again in the future.
--------------------
I loved this soup because all of the ingredients are familiar and it tastes flavorful and fresh. The small turkey meatballs and all the veggies are delicious, its satisfying and also filling. Perfect served with a little bit of crusty bread if you have it or as part of a larger meal. Its affordable and really tasty and I buy this frequently [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This soup was ok. I am not a huge fan of black eyed peas and missed the pic right on the can, omg. But it was good. Not to salty and the veggies tasted good in it. I like these new soups, they seem a lot fresher and less salty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This was sooo good. I loved the flavor & that it was a healthier version than a regular Italian Wedding soup.
--------------------
I purchased this soup for my Mother since she lives wedding soup! she ate it for lunch and told me right away that it was delicious and couldn't believe that it was from a can! she used to payingva lit more from the Italian restaurants nearby! plus, I know that it's nutritious, as well!!
--------------------
This was interesting. I wanted to try something I wouldn't normally try, and it was good, not great but good. I like that it had so many vegetables, and felt healthier than other soups I've had. it's going to be good in a cold day.
--------------------
this is my fave italian wedding soup. the meatballs are just right. the seasoning is just right. it is perfectly balanced
--------------------
A great soup for lunch with a bunch of noodles, meatballs, and chicken. It didnt taste like its healthy but it was light and tasty.
--------------------
I love the Well Yes! product line. Especially the sipping soups, no bowl needed. Great for on the go. Love the variety. I could eat it everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I was pleasantly surprised with this soup. Pouring out a can of soup is usually disappointingly brothy, lacking meat and veggies. Not so here. It actually looks just like the photo on the can. When does that ever happen? There are large chunks of carrots, celery, tons of pasta, and way more spinach than I expected. I am a turkey fan, usually making turkey meatballs or turkey sausage at least once a week, so I love the fact that this soup includes mini turkey meatballs! The only ingredient I thought it was lacking was the tomato chunks as the ingredients described, however, I only found one in the can. I definitely would have appreciated more tomatoes. The flavor is great, though I did add a sprinkle of salt. This is definitely going to be a new staple in my hurricane preparedness kit!
--------------------
Surprised! Tastes very good! I feel like this is homemade soup. Lots of solid inside this soup so it will fill me up!
--------------------
Well, Yes, I just may search out me an Italian wedding if theyre serving soup similar to this This is your, new & improved Italian-Style Wedding Soup, & it almost gets 5 Stars from me because its low in fat, calories, no added sugar, no preservatives, no artificial flavors, & packs in 13g of protein per can! Its also made with chicken bone broth & turkey meatballs without added antibiotics- nourishing! But, sadly the corn ingredients are from Genetically Modified crops GMO, so thats a turn off for me & Im sure many others who are trying to stick to certain diets for health reasons.
--------------------
first time I buy these canned soups and I loved their taste a light and cheap lunch that gets you out of trouble understand it is rich and easy to make the only thing is that the Italian vegetable is a bit acid
--------------------
I am assuming the garden vegetable with pasta is the same but couldn't find it. really great option for a vegan and so full of flavor that you won't miss the meat. very suprisingly filling and tastes like the quality you would expect of a restaurant like olive garden but easy to heat at home and you don't have to go out.
--------------------
This was another great variety of this soup. So far the family like this one and the Chicken and Rice the best. Easy to prepare and tastes great. All of us love soup, so I am glad that we decided to try this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This soup is pretty high in sodium so I was kind of hesitant to try it. It tastes good though! Unique flavour, not your ordinary style soup. Good!
--------------------
This soup was delicious! I was definitely surprised at the amount of flavor considering its on the healthier side of traditional Italian wedding soup. I would definitely repurchase.
--------------------
This is delicious. I usually make my Italian wedding soup from scratch, but this is almost as good and so much easier and cheaper!! Definitely a good purchase!
--------------------
This was my first time hearing of an Italian style wedding soup so I decided to give it a try. I cooked it on stovetop and it has an amazing taste. It has carrot, turkey meatballs, spinach, onion, and the little pasta balls that I am not familiar with but gives the soup a good combo. Its simple and fast to cook. I am definitely repurchasing this soup.
--------------------
I really like Italian wedding soup but this one was not my favorite. I think it was the turkey meatballs, yes its healthier but not as good as others Ive tried. I dont know if Ill get it again but it low in points and Im doing weight watchers so I might get it again.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this soup was. It was flavorful and the ingredients were plentiful. It wasnt too salty and filling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My dad loves Italian-Style Wedding soup. When I saw it was an option to try, I had to snag it. I love how flavorful the soup tastes. Theres just enough turkey meat in the soup so you dont miss some in a bite. Definitely add the Campbells Well Yes! soups to your next grocery pick up order.
--------------------
As someone that has lived my whole life only having delicious homemade wedding soup, this was pretty good. As with most canned soups it was salty but overall a good substitute if you dont have the time to make a homemade soup.

This is a delicious soup! The meatballs are really good and its not salty at all. I cooked it on the stovetop which was very easy. In fact, this is one of the best canned wedding soups Ive tried. Thanks Influenster for letting me try this for free! I will definitely buy this.
--------------------
This Italian Wedding soup reminds me of the soup I had on our Wedding Day. It taste very good. I have had this before and it is worth the price. It isnt expensive.
--------------------
Good tasting soup from trusted brand. I like the variety of flavors to choose from. It has natural ingredients, veggies, good amount of protein.
--------------------
when I saw Yes! had an Italian'Style Wedding soup, I knew I had to choose that one to try. This is good. the consistency is nice, jot too watery, not to thick. I would like for it to have more of an italian sausage flavor and the meat pieces are too small. The vegetables look fresh and are great tasting. Overall, i liked the soup. i would definitely buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I bought the Italian wedding soup for my husband and he had it for lunch today so I am relaying his experience. I like that the label shows what is included in the soups. You can look at the ingredients of course but at the grocery store Im usually trying to get out of there. What did he like about it? He enjoyed the pasta - pearl couscous. He said he wished there were more. The meatballs were like what he gets on pizza. Why he wouldnt have it again though was not taste - its acidic, which might be tomatoes.
--------------------
I love "wedding" soups! As flu season is around the corner plus the current pandemic I'm looking for comfort food. This soup fits the bill perfectly! Not only does it have a ton of vegetables but the meatballs are antibiotic free.
--------------------
The most authentic wedding soup is made in a can I recommend warming it , do not bring it to a boil separately it can turn your whole soup very bitter. Very tasty
--------------------
It is delicious just like home made soup from Italy these is one of my favorite soup and also my kids love it, I will definally keep buy it for sure it was my first time trying it pls everyone buy this soup [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I Love Italian-Style Wedding Soup, and this version by Campbells was Very Flavorful and thick, so A+ all around! There were 13g of protein in the can, and I ate the entire can :) I WILL definitely purchase more of these soups in the future! #influenster #WellYES #carrythrsoup
--------------------
I love wedding style soup and this one is the best Ive tasted from the can. Its not salty at all and it is super filling.
--------------------
I love this soup, its almost like my Nonna (grandmother) used to make. Its a great balance of flavors.
--------------------
I have tried every brand of Italian Style Wedding soup and Campbell's Well Yes has the best flavor and the freshest tasting ingredients. I love that this soup isn't overly salty. The veggies taste great, the pasta is the perfect texture and the turkey meatballs are actually amazing. This soup tastes like homemade!
--------------------
If you are a fan of classic Italian wedding soup, then youre going to LOVE Campbell's Well Yes! Italian-Style Wedding Soup. Not only does it taste delicious, it hits spot on a cold day. I love heating up these soups on the stove. Perfect serving for lunch. I recommend trying the entire line of Well Yes! Soups. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have never tried a soup like that before. It really tastes like home! Not like much canned soup we know. That taste is my favorite but I have to say Campbell's is my favorite brand. The plus is the reliable price.
--------------------
This soup smells great, but does not taste great. I tried to eat it with crackers but that didn't help as it seemed like there could be more flavor added to it. I wouldn't purchase this again, although the price is great and you get a lot of product for the price, the taste would not compel me to purchase it again.

I love soup, the kids do too! My personal go to is usually Italian wedding Soup so I was pleased to discover it in this brand. I really enjoyed the flavor and think it may be a bit better than my usual brand. Turkey meatballs? Yum. The can equals to about two of our household bowls so it's enough to share and easy to open. What can I say, I love cans that don't require me to dig out the can opener. So far the soup varieties I've tried are delicious and I'm looking forward to trying others.

Italian wedding is also one of my favorite soups and I am extra picky when it comes to which ones I like. You would never know this was a canned soup. Its delicious and super affordable and perfect for those chilly days! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I personally am not a big canned soup fan, but the first time I tried Campbell's Well Yes Italian Style Wedding soup, Oh MY Gosh! It was amazing! Prices vary a lot by where you buy them so it all depends on where you go that you get it for a good price. I wish mine had a little bit more meat in and a little less kale. Thats just my preference though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love wedding soup and Well Yes! is delicious and better for you than most wedding soups made with turkey meatballs and kale! So delicious. I go a little naughty and add a sprinkle of parmesan. I'm not feeling guilty afterwards either! I would buy this again and look forward to trying all the different varieties!
--------------------
This is my favorite! I am not a huge fan of canned soup because they contain so much sodium, but these soups are tasty and affordable! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

this was very tasty. I was always skeptical of wedding soups because most do not make them properly but this one definitely hit the spot.
--------------------
I love Italian wedding soup and this product delivered on taste and consistency. it was pretty easy to find in the store and reasonably priced. I would purchase this product again and recommend others to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Such a tasty and hearty soup! This is one of my favorite soups so I was super excited to try their version and it did not disappoint! This is the first try I have tried their soups in the can before and I will for sure be trying them again!
--------------------
This is definitely a good buy. First of the 3 varieties i purchased. the flavor is just right, not too salty. Comes in an easy open can and can be heated up stove top or microwave. I put some fresh cilantro leaves after heating for that refreshing taste. Its definitely heartwarming and filling, ones that is good to have especially with the incoming cold weather. #influenster #contestcomplimentary #digitalcampaign [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This was the best Italian eddying soup in a can Ive ever had. Gonna have to go out and buy more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I wish there were more variations in the store I went. I really wanted to try the Tortilla soup. My mouth waters just thinking about it. This is a great way to incorporate unnoticeable veggies to my kids' lunch. They really enjoyed this one, but we are willing to try other flavors, now that they do homeschooling I needed more ideas to give them lunch.
--------------------
First time trying this Campbell's well yes! Mediterranean style wedding soup. this is very delightful. No changed on this, very very good! I highly recommend getting this soup for your kitchen for a nice lunch or dinner thats easy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am currently on a liquid diet for 2 weeks due to surgery and this was so amazing! I strained it and drank the broth, which was so flavorful and tasted like homemade. My kids fought about who got to eat the chunks of my soup and they loved that as well.
--------------------
This was a very yummy soup. I really enjoyed the little turkey meatballs. Great value for the price with a great taste. This is the 3rd flavor I have tried and I have enjoyed them all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My twins (3.5) and I love this flavor of soup! I was thrilled to see that Well Yes now offers it! I love that I can read all the ingredients on the label and that it is packed with 13g of protein and has tons of Vitamin A, iron and uses Chicken Bone broth!!!!
--------------------
Very interesting flavor name for a soup. It contains a lot of whole vegetables, much more that I thought it will contain. Its very filling, not bland but very flavorful. I will definitely purchase again!
--------------------
I love Italian wedding soup and this well yes! version is delicious. very hearty, a ton of meat and noodles. would definitely purchase this one again
--------------------
Recently purchased for influenster campaign and very surprised! Tasty and fresh and not "thick" and gravy like other soups. I felt full and satisfied healthily with this soup. Wish my store had more of the varieties of the well yes soups, but pleased with the qualities. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Absolutely love this flavor of soup! Love that theres extra protein and the seasoning is on point. I will repurchase and recommend to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This soup was delicious. I think this canned version is easy to mistake as homemade. It smells and taste amazing. I would buy it again and recommend it to soup lovers!
--------------------
I received a cash back trial of Campbell's Well Yes soup from influenster. It was pretty hearty, but I thought that it lacked flavor. I liked the fact that it is a healthy version and that there are so many interesting choices. Not conventional flavors like in their regular line of soup. But when I tried it, I felt it could use a little something more as far as seasoning. The meatballs were tiny and had a very unpleasant texture. If you're looking for a new flavor to try, something that is a healthy option, I would recommend giving this a go. But maybe have some spice on the side to add and give it a little boost.
--------------------
I'm super excited about soup season. I chose Italian Wedding Soup, because I grew up with it and I miss my mom's version . Of course this doesn't compare, but it's an easy grab when the cravings hit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This soup was really delicious!!! I usually find canned soups too salty, and this one was a bit salty, but it was super flavorful and I love that it wasnt mostly broth. It was full of turkey meatballs, orzo and chunky vegetables. Overall it was really tasty and I would definitely purchase it again. Thanks Influenster and Campbells for giving me the opportunity to try it out and review it!! #influenster #incentivized #gotitfree
--------------------
Great flavorful soup that has plenty of add-ins. I loved the al dente texture of the orzo pasta. There were more mini meatballs than I was expecting (which was a good thing) but I could have done with a bit more of the kale, tomatoes, and carrots. I loved that it was flavorful and not just salty tasting. I would definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My go to for sick days. Makes me feel better just by eating this. Love that it has the perfect flavor.
--------------------
This is a great choice for anyone that likes bold but hearty soups. This soup is packed with veggies (celery, carrots, spinach) and meat (meatballs and sausage). Every bite you take includes some type of flavor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This was also delicious, but I could do without the turkey meatballs. Sorry I did not love them! Great price, large veggie serving, easy and tasty for a busy schedule. Low in calories so you won't feel too guilty. If you are worried about sodium just balance it by drinking lots of water that you should be drinking anyway. Can't wait to try the other flavors.

Campbell's Well Yes! Italian-Style Wedding Soup is nutritious and deliciously crafted with turkey meatballs, pasta, carrots and spinach . Theres two packs 18% of your daily nutrition ...Thats amazing for one of my favorite soups and this one comes close to homemade. Enjoy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Definitely not a fan of this soup. It has good flavor but nope wont try again way to much salt added to even be healthy at all. Priced right right amount of veggies yes. But basically cant try any of the other soups not vegan friendly [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Just like nonnas Sunday dinner! Its rich and creamy! The spinach and noodles are sheer perfection. Didnt even need salt or pepper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I found it to be fairly bland with slimy orzo and over boiled veggies. Also, I was shocked at how little nutritional value it had when I actually read the label. It was way over priced for what it was and honestly, kind of a let down.
--------------------
This is my favorite out of the line so far! I will be continuing to try more of them, but I'm definitely stocking up on this one.
--------------------
So yummy and good for you, too. Not super salty like other soups. I've tried a few flavors of the Well Yes soups and this one might be my favorite. I will be ordering more!
--------------------
Quick and easy; reasonably good flavor.
