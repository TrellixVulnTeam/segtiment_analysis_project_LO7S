Why would you put the bananas in a bag with cans?!? Just wanted a quick Target run. Had kids in the car so I thought this would be a good idea???
--------------------
I don’t see why there are so many 1 star reviews?? Every banana purchase we have made at Target has been a good experience. The bananas are usually ready to eat and have a good fruit basket shelf life. We normally buy about 2 bunches each trip just because our kids love eating these and they don’t last long in our house!
--------------------
they gave us bad bananas.
--------------------
Yummy delicious and a great price! Keep it up Target.
--------------------
Delicious free range bananas, you can really tell it was ethically raised in a loving environment.
--------------------
The bananas they brought out were almost completely brown. They won’t even be good by tomorrow. I did not know until I got home and unpacked them, so I guess I am stuck with them. Very disappointed in the quality. I have not had difficulty picking up produce from other stores.
--------------------
My bananas all have a brownish/grey tint to them. Very disappointed.
--------------------
Who doesn’t like a tasty banana snack? I certainly do!
--------------------
They are bananas. People who are picky about their fruit should pick it out themselves.
--------------------
These are great quality bananas that taste good and have enough potassium to power me through my workouts. This is one of my favorite snacks to get at Target. Highly recommend
--------------------
Took them out of the bag like this. What the heck!?
--------------------
Tasty! Usually pick up fruit in store myself.
--------------------
This is the first time, but I received 6 banana. They are not fresh. I did not request "Fresh ones, please", because usually they deliver fresh banana. I have to use or eat 6 banana right away.
--------------------
the bananas I got were too brown, I threw them out. Tried posting a pic but I keep getting kicked out of the app.
--------------------
Bananas are always great. You are able to specify exactly the kind of bananas you want. Even when green, they are always ripe and ready to eat.
--------------------
Banana damage or almost expired.
--------------------
The one banana they apparently had left in the store was so rotten and really shouldn’t have been sold.
--------------------
Got 6 bananas and 3 of them were so bruised and soft. So disappointed
--------------------
Wow these bananas make me go bananas. They are bright and fun, but also have a beautiful taste. Will be repurchasing!
--------------------
Yummy bananas! Likely better when you pick your own.
--------------------
Excellent quality! Overall, had a great experience with the pick up.
--------------------
Great for a quick 29 cent bite. Just make sure you pick the bananas. But I have tasted better at other stores so it must be how they store these.
--------------------
Targets bananas are always on point. what's not to like about a nanner!
--------------------
Bought these bananas several times. 3 out of 4 times they were mostly rotten and bruised. The last time was significantly better, but honestly it’s not worth the anxiety of possibly getting bad produce. Target is usually good at offering high quality products. I just hope their fresh produce comes up to par.
--------------------
Imagine rating bananas 1 star. They all come from the same place people!
--------------------
go else and buy 1 lb in 29 cents
--------------------
Hi there thanks so happy happy Friday
--------------------
Bananas were good and lasted for a week
--------------------
I don't know what it is, about bananas I purchase at Target, but they go from green to rotten in 48 hours. This doesn't happen with any other bananas I purchase at any other grocery store. Luckily, I was intending to make banana bread, so them browning in 2 days was actually to my advantage.
--------------------
This tastes good and each bana was about medium sized. They were not very large which was fine. We had a variety of green on the stem as well. It’s been about 4 days and they are still good for eating. They don’t taste any different then other banana you get from other stores and work fine for us.
--------------------
They were too soft and badly bruised.
--------------------
That’s how they pick when you ask for delivery
--------------------
Not good bananas 
Squishy
--------------------
I don't know what it is, but every time I buy bananas from Target they do not taste good. They are still green, but browning in some spots.
--------------------
These bananas were a good flavor. However, they were a little more banged up and ripened a bit faster then their organic versions I purchased the other week. I would purchase again but check better for bruising and get a greener batch.
--------------------
They always have bruised, small, and green bananas.
--------------------
I love these bananas! Its not often I find ready to eat ripe ones either!
--------------------
I bought a banana from the Target in West St Paul and I was not disappointed. Unlike other retailers who use a yellow light bulb to enhance color Target's bananas are #nofilter. I used the banana in my unboxing video and my fans/kids were thrilled.
--------------------
Prices of frozen fruit from target are the best
--------------------
Honestly, these are really amazing! I absolutely love strawberries but frozen bananas are pretty darn good as well. I am so obsessed with this bag, I wish they were on sale but they're not. They're totally worth the money. I didnt get a chance to make a strawberry banana smoothie because I just ate them fresh out the bag. This is like a healthy alternative to ice cream. My biggest regret is that I didn't buy enough bags. I wish I could "order pickup/drive up" these bad boys but I cant. Can't wait to go back to target, hopefully they're still in stock.
--------------------
So good, I use this to make my smoothies everyday. Blends really well and tastes great.
--------------------
10/10 would recommend!
--------------------
I just found this at Target this week and I am so pleased — saved me the step of peeling bananas when making smoothies! I used them for the first time today and the quality was great.
--------------------
I used to buy the Target Market Pantry 48 oz strawberry & banana blend for post-workout protein shakes and smoothies.  The quality was very good, as was the value.  It appears as though the Market Pantry store brand is no longer being carried and has been replaced with Good & Gather?  While I appreciate the quality and organic profile of the G&G product, I don't feel as if it provides the value of the previous Market Pantry product.
--------------------
Good flavor but messy. I didn’t realize they would be so messy. I also didn’t realize there was added sugar so that was disappointing. My 2.5 year old loved them though.
--------------------
They look nothing like the box! I thought they’d look like dippin dots. Daughter ate a few bites. I agree with previous review, mix into yogurt
--------------------
My 10 year old just loves these. So hard to find new healthy snacks! She goes through 3 boxes a week! Please keep selling.
--------------------
I love these! They’re healthy and delicious! The yoghurt bits are pretty yummy too!
--------------------
I absolutely love these and Target is the only place I can find them so I hope they continue to carry them! Like adult dippin dots. So good and help me stay on track while satiating my sweet tooth!
--------------------
Bought a box and my 9 yr old son ate the entire box in one sitting. He loved them. Cool,sweet, healthy treat!
--------------------
they don't look like nothing in the picture. they look mushy, but because of the juice. Thought they were going to be more like the actual picture on the box, but they're messy. It's better to mix them in yogurt
--------------------
I love giving these to my 16month old picky eater. We have such a hard time getting him to eat anything and these make me feel so much better knowing he has something in his belly. He absolutely loves these.
--------------------
These and Super Bellies are amazing. The obvious simple nutrition and great flavors. I sometimes eat them too with my son lol. He’s 9 months and I’ve been giving him stage 4 of Happy Tots and I couldn’t be anymore satisfied. I’m always checking for new flavors. He loves beets too.
--------------------
Our 13 month old daughter absolutely lights up when she gets this one and I’m pretty sure it’s her fave!
--------------------
Great taste for our picky eater and has spinach which our child refuses to eat, but in this container, they have no idea, and we couldn’t be happier for it! Definitely recommend
--------------------
Food pouches are the easiest thing to give my 1yr old that gives good nutrients. She can suck it up like a smoothie on her own. The flavor of this one is good too!
--------------------
My picky eater is obsessed with this flavor. It’s the only way we get some fruits and veggies in!
--------------------
my kiddos favorite pouch. tried other mango and banana flavored pouches from other brands but they devour these ones.
--------------------
Appreciate these dried bananas without any added sugar. Pre-soak them overnight and they are a great and healthy addition to a smoothie.
--------------------
So good !!!!! Remind me of my childhood .
--------------------
Sometimes they’re incredibly chewy, so much so that I’m worried my crowns will fall off if I eat them. When they’re less chewy they’re great.
--------------------
I use these as treats for my pet rabbits, they love them! I only feed them dried fruit w/ nothing else added so these are perfect and the LOVE them! Not as messy as fresh bananas either, and 1 slice is more than enough per day for 1 house rabbit.
--------------------
When the Good and Gather brand first arrived at target the quality of these were outstanding.  I just bought a bag and all the pieces are so hard.  Not crunchy but liuke biting into hard caramel.  Hopefully they can go back to whatever they were doing at the start
--------------------
These taste just like the ones my grandma made growing up. I love these. I've never been able to get mine to taste like hers so I'm happy I can buy them. I hate the super crunchy ones!
--------------------
Maybe I'm crazy, but I think dried banana slices are supposed to be crunchy. And I like crunchy. These are soft and chewy and unlike any dried fruit I've ever had. They're almost like a gummy version of a banana. I hate it.
--------------------
Love these!  It’s almost Halloween so I picked up three bags of these.  I eat them all day long - soooooo good!
--------------------
My son favorite. He likes this a lot. Good combination flavor.
--------------------
A little pricey but my daughter loves these. I love how many nutrients are in them!
--------------------
My 6 year old daughter loves these. The little animals inside are brightly colored  and detailed. She likes that she can attach all of the bananas that she has collected and that they are scented.
--------------------
We received series 4 which is quite different in quality compared to series 1. Series 4 came with a figure, large gems, collector sticker and a ring pet to wear the figure- huh? No little foodie friends. No vine stand. Quite disappointing. The figure itself seems to be of lower quality in structure and design.
--------------------
Very cute toy. My kids love that you can keep the bananas and they still function after being open.
Great price. Most places charge $6-7 for just a single banana.
--------------------
My daughter really wanted this after seeing the commercial for them. We could only find them at Target and they are super cute I’m person! Love that it comes as a banana bunch and not just one. She has been playing with them quite a bit and reusing the banana peels. I will probably be purchasing again as a present for her birthday!
--------------------
My 5 year old was thrilled to receive this for her birthday
--------------------
Saw these on a commercial and my daughter had to have them so I ordered them for her birthday which hasn’t come yet. The toy looks very cute and like something she will love. It came with a bunch of three bananas, I thought they would be sold individually so was happy with how much she is getting for the price. I hadn’t seen them anywhere in stores so was glad Target carried them and then after I placed the order, I did spot them in a Target store.
--------------------
My granddaughter loves them, she told me it was the best day of her life. She's only 4!!
--------------------
nothing really in the banana's. So disappointing!! My 6 year old granddaughter even was looking at it like.... REALLY... THAT'S IT!!!
--------------------
Purchased for my grandson who loved it! Cute toy...exciting to see what is included in each banana. Only complaint...too many small pieces that can be left around as swallowing hazards for younger siblings.
--------------------
LOVE LOVE LOVE these, I don’t know if you’ve ever stepped on a hatchimal egg but it’s awful, these not only have more than one toy inside, they have stickers so my daughter could keep a journal of the animals she has and the toys fit back into the bananas and the peels can close up and open again so they have storage and can link together and have hooks to hang them on the wall so that my tiny kiddos can’t get into my oldest daughters toys! Oh and they smell like bananas even after being sanitized!
--------------------
Such a cute toy. Great for all ages. Boys and girls would like this toy.
--------------------
Great price for a toy seen elsewhere for $17.99!!! Cute, fun to open.
--------------------
Got this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter, she love surprise toys and has been wanting this for a while.
--------------------
Bought for a granddaughters present and very cute and well made from the outside. I haven't seen what they look like inside but I'm sure she will enjoy after reading other comments.
--------------------
These are super adorable & fun! My daughter loves these. They even smell like bananas too!
--------------------
These were cute since you could peel them. It was a pleasant surprise they were scented. I gave 4 stars because there isn't much you can do once they are open. The price seemed high for a toy that is really just for collecting the figures. My child had a difficult time attaching the bananas back together. They are worth purchasing at least once if your family enjoys blind bags and new toys.
--------------------
So Adorable my 4 yrs old love it’s. she’s want bananas for it’s worth the price the animals are much bigger then all the other collectibles. Buying more for Christmas! Go Bananas! Go go bananas!
--------------------
Awesome collectible toy. Fun to open for my 5 year old!
--------------------
Baby loves this flavor and these travel easy without refrigeration
--------------------
My 18month old just won’t give these up he loves them
--------------------
Good tasting. However, ordering online was not a good idea. The box was in terrible shape and two of the pouches had puncture like scratches on them, making them almost lost products. This was not from shipping but rather from the shipping/distribution center. BE MORE CAREFUL GUYS! Thanks.
--------------------
My toddler loves this!
--------------------
I bought these on a really good sale and although I thought the flavors were a little weird, my baby isn't picky so I thought we could give it a try. They have a ton of vegetables in them, and although I was a little skeptical, my son thinks they're delicious and gobbles them down.

Beware - due to the beets, this particular food stains really badly. Not horrible if you're prepared, but the first time I was definitely caught off guard.
--------------------
Our little girl loves these!! She is a seriously picky eater and we are trying to give her food with more texture as well as more veggies and these worked like a charm!
--------------------
I have four kids (1, 3, 5, 7) and they all eat these. The little two won't touch veggies so these are the only way I get them to eat some. The purple one is their favorite, followed by the orange and sometimes they'll tolerate the green one. They're quite expensive but I haven't figured out any other way to sneak in veggies so it's worth it to me!
--------------------
My toddler recently started declining veggies and this has a full serving hidden with fruit. Wish there was a little less sugar but overall a great alternative to no veggies!
--------------------
My 3 boys absolutely loved the squeezable fruit on the go! I often lean towards the no sugar added and this was the perfect choice for the boys. My oldest would grab one on the way out the door to football practice and my little would wake up from a nap wanting fruit. The flavor was amazing!
--------------------
Neither flavor was that pronounced. Tasted mostly like applesauce with no apparent mango, passion fruit, or pineapple flavors. Could taste some banana in the one that includes banana.
--------------------
My daughter loves the new flavorw
--------------------
I loved that these are made of real fruit, super convenient, and the flavor options. I was surprised how there was so much product in the pouch. Easy to throw in my purse or the car for a quick snack on the go. My son thought they tasted great and we're easy enough for him to open on his own. Definitely will repurchase!
--------------------
If your kids love GoGo Squeez, they will love these! The GoGo BIG Squeez are 33% bigger and they offer 1/2 cup serving of fruit, so they are perfect for older kids who still love these but need a slightly bigger portion. We tried Peppy Pineapple and Merry Mango — my kids love both flavors! Definitely recommend! Great for on the go or as a side in their lunch.
--------------------
Love its a nice healthy snack not loaded with sugar and taste great also.
--------------------
My son did not like it He did not like the texture.
--------------------
Not only did my daughter love these but I did as well! I really liked the taste and it reminded me of applesauce so it was definitely easier and more convenient to get my servings of fruit down!
--------------------
Finally a pouch with more! My kids love the fruit pouches but demolish the regular size ones in one gulp. This size slowed them down a bit and it fills their bellies a little more. Surprisingly all 3 of my boys had no issues with either mango or pineapple and they're pretty picky about trying new flavors. Big thumbs up!
--------------------
I love these !! The pineapple ones are soo delicious 😋 and my kids all love them too !!
--------------------
I would have to say it's a great concept but not our cup of tea. The flavors are very mild to none, and it's a bit watery compared to others I have bought. If your child likes apple juice and apple sauce mixed they may go for it. The package was great though I love the squeeze pouches! I always say try it at least once though.
--------------------
My 7 year old is such a picky eater. It is hard to get her to eat Fruits or Vegetables. She tried the Pineapple one and LOVED it!!! Then she tried the Mango one and loved it too!! My 15 year old said it tasted like baby food but overall liked it. The flavors were good, didn't taste too sweet or bitter. The convenience of the pouch is great especially when you are on the go. The lid can be screwed back on to eliminate potential messes... and it was easy enough to open and close for anyone.
--------------------
My kiddos love the flavors of these Go go big squeeze pouches. My daughter see them and commented that " these are HUGE! " She was so excited to show her school class on her zoom call! They have been eating them daily for a snack and we will continue to buy them. Such a great product.
--------------------
I brought these home and mistakenly out them on my counter while family was outside for a BBQ. As we sit down to eat dinner I hear "no, only gogo squeeze". I look at what this child is taking about and noticed he got into my gogo squeeze pack and had ate 4 so far and now his sister wanted hers. The kids loved them obviously and I admit they were really good. It's like eating applesauce but in other flavors. When you pour them out of the package, it looks exactly like applesauce.
--------------------
My girls are already big fans of the GoGo SqueeZ fruit on the go pouches, but sometimes they just aren't quite big enough for them! These GoGo BIG SqueeZ fruit on the go pouches are just the right size, though, with 1/2 cup of fruit in each pouch! We love these for at home, lunches, or road trips because they're super convenient and don't need any refrigeration. My girls really enjoy the mix of flavors and I adore the fact these are Non-GMO and 100% fruit with no added sugar! We love this brand and it's a great way to get your kids to eat more fruit!
--------------------
This was a no brainier for us, I've been buying Go-Go's for my kids since they were little,they are 11 and 14 now. They both play sports,so the bigger pouches are great for a snack before or after practice. The flavors are dynamite, mango and pineapple what's not to love!
--------------------
I'm a huge fan of GoGo SqueeZ, so trying the Big SqueeZ was awesome. My daughter and I always grab a SqueeZ when we need a snack. I love the Mango and Pineapple flavors so much. I'll be keeping the Big SqueeZ on hand for now on. Yummy!!
--------------------
My daughter has always been a huge fan of GoGo squeez but as she has gotten older, one pouch was never enough. We were so excited when we got our box of GoGo Big squeez! We are often on the go to medical appointments and these are just perfect to throw in our bag and have on hand for when that HANGRY moment strikes. My girl especially loves the pineapple, and this mama loves that she's enjoying a healthy snack with no added sugar. Bring on more flavors!
--------------------
These taste really great and my kids love them especially the apple and banana flavors. They are very healthy and are made with 100% fruit. I also enjoy them as a snack since they are in bigger pouches. My kids love the pouches especially the covers, it looks like helicopter blades. What a healthy and fun snack for kids.
--------------------
I am the mother of a 2 year old who will eat anything and a 7 year old who is the pickiest eater ! No soon as we received our package my kids could not put the GoGo Big SqueeZ down ! I couldn't even get a picture or video in ! I've been on the lookout for the flavors at our grocery store ever since , they have been begging for more!
--------------------
Love the new flavors and the bigger pouches are great for older kids. They were a huge hit in our house.
--------------------
My daughters really liked them. They liked both flavors. The said they were better than the normal go gurts I usually purchase for them. I will defiantly be buying more of these in the future. We have also told our friends and family members about them, they are going to try them now.
--------------------
This so good even my kids loved it I really recommend this it's so delicious
--------------------
My kids have always enjoyed GoGoSqueeZ. They even love the yogurt ones as well. I do like the size. It's bigger than the normal ones. I really love the packaging!!! Both flavors were good. I personally liked the apple, pineapple, peach one. Looking forward to trying the other boxes.
--------------------
So glad someone finally started making these in larger pouches for adults. I love taking these to work or eating one on the go when I don’t have time for breakfast. They’re a tad expensive but when they’re on sale it’s worth it
--------------------
omg the good and gather dried fruits are beyond horrible...they taste like goat feed. horrible. I almost threw up. I'd give no stars. Tastes like dried straw...all of them.
--------------------
Love this! I can’t stop myself and I always eat the whole bag in one setting, but with no added sugar I don’t feel bad about it. Definitely recommend, but grab two or three bags because these suckers go fast.
--------------------
Not great. I opened the bag to find one solid clump of fruit. Some of it was so hard I could barely chew it. I won’t be purchasing again.
--------------------
the mango and pineapple are amazing in this, but the bananas are much too hard to chew.
--------------------
Ever since I tried this, it has been part of my grocery list. The pineapple was perfectly sweet with a bit of tang, the mango was great like usual, the banana is what surprises me the most with its tastiness. One time they ran out of it at my local Target, so I bought mango and banana separately. THEY WERE NOT THE SAME. Somehow, the fruits in this blend were better than if you would buy it separately. Different recipe? Different supplier? Who knew. Highly recommend the blend. You won't be able to stop yourself and portion it into 3 servings like it is suggested. But hey, organic and nothing added, there are worst things to binge eating on.
--------------------
My toddler is going through one of those picky eating stages where she refuses to eat anything with nutritional value... But she LOVES these pouches! Makes me feel so much better that she’s still getting some veggies in and not to mention they are one of the easiest snacks ever when we’re on the go.
--------------------
My kids love this combination of fruits and veggies
--------------------
My 14 month old loves these pouches. It’s nice to know she’s getting her fruits and veggies in!
--------------------
My 2 yr old loves all of these happy tots pouches as a snack. I like that there is always at least 1 ingredient that isn’t too common in the house included and helps get her to have it as a part of her diet.
--------------------
My son has eaten these since he became a toddler and loves them! And easy way to get in some veggies and fruits between meals.
--------------------
Easy to give, no mess, travel easy, and the taste is great even for our picky eater! Definitely recommend
--------------------
My daughter absolutely loves these.
--------------------
Baby loves this brand! And I've tried them and they're pretty good. All the blends are nice and sweet tasting so they appeal to the little guy.
--------------------
Was turned onto this organic food for my elderly Mom who had a stroke and has trouble swallowing most foods now. She loves this food, every flavor!!
--------------------
I buy these in bulk for my 2 year old daughter. They're healthy (a FULL serving of veggies) and super convenient, and most importantly, my daughter loves them!
--------------------
Kiddos love the taste and I love how easy and healthy they are. Win-win
--------------------
These are positively addictive! I absolutely love these plain banana chips as well as the cinnamon variety. Super sweet and easy to go through most of the bag in one sitting. I will say that these are pricey, as well as the brands other chip styles so look for them on sale and buy all the bananas!
--------------------
The best snack with a cold bottle of water while watching your son play basketball on a Saturday. I love the crunchy firm texture that’s the highlight for me. Cant keep a bag in the house for more than one night.
--------------------
Wish it could be a little less expensive but not by changing anything about the product and more could be in the bag. Hopefully I'm not asking too much. Have a blessed day!
--------------------
I usually love these type of snacks. These were so hard. I thought my teeth would break. Maybe it was just an old batch.
--------------------
They were great tasting but the bag was full of air.
--------------------
crunchy exactly how I like my banana chips
--------------------
I grew up on banana chips, homemade and store bought and this isn’t it. They’re overcooked and sound like glass in the bag, so brown and SO sour. They’re overpriced to have such disgusting flavor and be unappealing in looking burnt.
--------------------
I usually love banana chips but these were super dark and seemed burnt and were so hard and overly crunchy I spit it out and threw them away. I do not recommend these.
--------------------
I tried the cinnamon and Apple and they're great. Got another plus granny smith. They are wonderful. But beI really do not like banana chips at all! But i love bananas. Do they have a different flavor & texture than ordinary banana chips? I would have to order online. Are they worth it?
--------------------
I purchased the banana chip today. The flavor was delicious but too hard to chew. A lot of the chips were really dark looking as if they were over cooked. I would buy again if you can not leave then in the oven so long
--------------------
When i tried these for the first time the taste was SO amazing, they have a similar taste to fried plantain bananas. But not sure if it was just my bag but they were abnormally hard, like could potentially chip a tooth if i was eating in a rush & im young and don't have sensitive teeth. Hopefully it was just this bag and not consistently inedible. Otherwise the flavor was o delicious, if these were more tender it would definitely be my go to snack
--------------------
These are garbage. They’re so hard you can barely break them to chew. If you do like them I would be very upset about the price. For almost five dollars you get maybe 15 chips inside. This is a picture from a brand new opened bag.
--------------------
After being on a liquid diet for two weeks for a medical condition, I was craving something crunchy and discovered your simply banana chips. I’m so disappointed! They taste almost burnt and way too crunchy... like afraid I’m going to break my teeth crunchy. A waste of money and an unfulfilled craving.
--------------------
These were so awful. Im used to "normal" banana chips and I spit this out when I tried one and threw bag away. Awful taste..not for me.
--------------------
These are the worse banana chips I have ever tasted. When I opened the bag, there was a terrible smell that came out of the bag. The chips were also very dark in color, like they had been burnt. It was a terrible tasting chip. It didn't even taste like a banana. It was also very expensive compared to the amount of product in the package.
--------------------
I bought several varieties of these yummy and healthy baked chips at my local Publix. So far, there isn't a flavor I don't like. Love the Banana, Strawberry Banana, and Apple. If you're like me, I don't feel like I've snacked on something I'm not crunching ;) These have got the perfect crunch. I've also crumbled them into my plain Greek yogurt for a pop of flavor. I read some of the previous reviews about "pink" chips...just wondering if the buyers accidentally bought the Strawberry Banana thinking it was plain Banana? I plan on trying more flavors.
--------------------
LOVE !!! all the flavors that I have tried so far: banana, strawberry, blueberry, raspberry, & apple. LOVE !!! that they are sugar free (WHAT I LOVE !!! MOST - which is not a review question option), nothing extra added, & wholesome, portable way to get in fruit throughout the day in mini-meals. Just need to know the potassium content for the banana chips...
--------------------
I love your chips. Sadly the bananas in the plain banana bag were pink & tasted like strawberries. Luckily I tried one before giving it to my son who is allergic to strawberries.
--------------------
I've purchased plain Bare banana chips three times. The first bag had been oxidized (store accepted return), the second was delicious, and the third was full of pink/brown colored, strawberry flavored chips. My family enjoys this product and they're the best banana chips I've ever had. But for the price and the very small quantity in the bag, there really needs to be better quality assurance.
--------------------
Very sweet, but super crunchy with a nice taste, will definitely buy more and would love to try the apples ones if I can find them in my city. I do wish there was more in a package though.
--------------------
I just tried these and OMG they are fantastic! I love the flavor and the crunch. I cannot wait to try the other flavors and varieties.
--------------------
These are really good banana chip made from only banana. The problem is that the package are 3/4 feel with air and only 1/4 of banana. They also are really small: for a family it would be best to have larger bag and bigger portion of banana. Thanks
--------------------
We started selling Bare at the store where I work so I tried them and they are really good. But once you open the bag there was more air than product. For the price I was disappointed. But they are very very tasty.
--------------------
I received a sample of these. They are the best banana chips I’ve ever had. I’m not normally a fan, but I enjoyed my sample so much that I’m looking at what else they bake. I’ll be eating these chips regularly!
--------------------
We are always looking for something with no additives, no fillers, no cross contamination of allergens, etc. These fit the bill, and they taste terrific! Keep in mind that they are VERY crunchy, and may not work for you if you have sensitive teeth. However, if you like crunch, these are delicious.
--------------------
Absolutely delicious, it is extremely crunchy and naturally sweet. The bag was only a quarter filled.... for the price and the amount you get....you form your own opinion.
--------------------
They're fine, but WAY too expensive for what they are. I wouldn't buy them again.
--------------------
There are some good things about these chips-like the fact that bag is plentiful and (hopefully only one ingredient) But the flavor is off just slightly and they are so crunchy I am worried for my dental work. Not the best Iâve had.
--------------------
I hate bananas but love banana flavour. I tried these as they were all natural with 1 ingredient. They taste like roasted plantains. Cooked foods develop the sugars and that's why these are delicious, sweets, caramelised, crunchy treats.
--------------------
Most of the banana chips I have tried are soft. The crunch and the carmelized flavor make these UNIQUE as well as WONDERFUL! I love these chips!
--------------------
When I first tried it, I thought they werent very good. But, they grew on me. Perfect treat to give you a little natural sugar and they are extremely crunchy. These are my go-to snack on whole 30, or when eating all naturally. They are not the fried sugary banana chips , so , you cant expect them to be that mind blowing. However, for a completely all natural baked banana chip, I dig them.
--------------------
Sorry Bare Snacks, these are the most awful things I have tasted. They arrived perfectly packaged, that's where the good ended. The chips were a very dark brown color, they tasted like they were over-baked. I gave one to my husband, he agreed that they were over-baked. Sorry will not be purchasing these again. I hope to get a refund from Bare Snacks. Would be zero stars if possible.
--------------------
I bought a bag of your Simply Bananas at the Houston International Airport. When I opened them on the plane I was surprised that they were pink! Then I realized that you had put the strawberry variety into a simply banana bag. I did not want strawberry, but I ate some of them. They were far too sweet, and when two chips had overlapped, the bonded portion was too hard to bite through. So, you need to do some better QC, and keep the right type in the right package, and only single chips, so they can be crunched without risking your teeth. For the price you are charging these kind of QC issues should not be there. Charge what you want, but deliver value to match your price.
--------------------
Great snack to curb my desire for sweets. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the cost. Pricey for so little
--------------------
I wanted to say how much I loved these. The bananas were so sweet and crunchy. How does it get so carmelized when baking without additional ingredients?
--------------------
First time trying these banana chips, picked up after falling in love with the bare apple chips and excited to read that there's no sugar or oil in these banana chips. Was very disappointed to find alot of dark brown banana chips with a burnt after taste- not sure if all batches taste like this, but bummed we spent so much on a product we won't be able to eat any more of.
--------------------
I just opened these up excited for a snack and to my surprise the bag is only half full of these chips. The other half seems to be wasted space and air. The flavor is incredible but if you're going to pay x amount for such a small portion I would reconsider.
--------------------
I hate bananas and I'm so surprised at how great these taste!
--------------------
Both a teether and a snack!!! Happy Baby organics has amazing favors and my babies LOVED these crackers.
--------------------
These are great snacks to have in a diaper bag and to give to baby at home. We love this brand and￼ I like to switch it up by buying the different flavors. They dissolve easily in the mouth and are easy to hold.￼
--------------------
My boy love these ! Only downfall is that they are beyond sticky when they melt
--------------------
My daughter loves these. They make her gums feel good.
--------------------
I got the sweet potato banana and my 6 month old did not like it at all. She wasn’t happy with the texture and it was flavorless. I tried one myself to see why she didn’t like it and it has no flavor at all!
--------------------
My little guy absolutely loves these! They last long just long enough to satisfy his teething needs. The only downfall is that they get slightly sticky once they begin to melt down.
--------------------
I little boy loves it perfect size for little ones easy get hold on tiny hands. My elder toddler loves it more than the baby I love how it’s packed and easy to keep bags as it’s individual packed it doesn’t get dry whole box :)
--------------------
This a while for my son to adjust to maily becuase its a bit on the dry side so have something to drink near by. I had a bottle of forumla for my son. It's not too sweet nor not too mild but has a just right taste....you can taste both flavors of the crackers as you're chewing on it
--------------------
These dissolve easily and my baby loves them. It is so convenient to be able to give her a cracker while I finish getting her dinner ready. I love that I don’t have to worry about her chocking, because they dissolve so quickly. They are also great for little hands, my tiny 6 month old could feed herself with these without any problems.
--------------------
My baby girl is 6 months and loves these crackers. I take them everywhere with me and if she gets cranky she can nibble on these. She loves them.
--------------------
Love love love! These were a favorite when our little one started teething and having more than just her bottle!!
--------------------
These wafers have saved me so many times! I always take one of these with me while we are out and anytime my baby gets cranky and I need to buy a little time, I give him one of these and it does the trick! Easy to grab for little ones, great flavor and also soothes teething gums.
--------------------
Can I just say these are just the best! My daughter LOVED these! She is super picky and struggles very much with food due to allergies and these made eating and teething so much more bearable for her. They even smell delicious! Thumbs up.
--------------------
My son absolutely loves these teething cracker. Every time he’s teething I give him this and it totally calms him. I’ve tried it to make sure it dissolves and I can say it definitely does
--------------------
My baby loves these wafers !! Best thing Ive ever come across. Super easy to eat. Melts easily so babies have no hard time. My baby is a little messy so she leaves me with dried up stains all the time but no biggie. Recommend these wafers to allllll moms
--------------------
I wanted to like these because of the stated Organic/Non-GMO, but I ate one myself and it had a “plastic” taste to it. Had to return them.
--------------------
Super easy for my baby to enjoy. Enjoyed that even before her teeth came in she could eat it without a problem.
--------------------
My daughter loved the little teethers. However, they don't dissolve well at all. My daughter choked on them at 8 months, I gave her a little more time thinking maybe she wasn't ready yet and tried them again and she still had issues with them dissolving. They are also incredibly messy. I wouldn't recommend these at all.
--------------------
This is a baby snack so very healthy for babies there are not too expensive I seen these five packs for five dollars and do babies will love this one
--------------------
My daughter took to them right away. She seems to like the flavor and wants more. I like them because they are organic and use healthier options
--------------------
This was actually one of my favorite products that I bought with my daughter and my son when they started teething this actually melts in your mouth a lot faster than a yogurt melts and its easier for them to chew so you dont have to worry about them choking or anything like that
--------------------
My son loves these! They are great to help relieve pressure/pain from teething as well as give him a small snack. I wish they had a little bit more nutrients to them but other than that, these are great for young ones!
--------------------
Perfect for teething baby! She loves it and it’s not messy.
--------------------
Great for a grumpy, hungry, teething baby. I dip In yogurt to add some nutrients to it.
--------------------
A little pricier than most other brands, and not much different in quality or taste...I would rather save a little money and get almost the exact product from a different brand. If you are passionate about buying only organic, its probably worth the extra cost! Not remarkably better, otherwise.
--------------------
We've been buying these for over a year now -- and my daughter is 19 month old. Love that I can buy just 1 unit (to get multiple flavors) on Target.com. Texture is perfect for babies & toddlers.
--------------------
We used these when my youngest was teething and he really seemed to like them. The consistency was good. They arent super messy. I would purchase again and recommend them to others.
--------------------
My daughter’s teeth start growing. I wanna buy some eatable food for her to bite. This is a perfect choice. She love this product
--------------------
This is such a cool rice puff snack. Its a good shape and size for babies to grip. A more independent snack. Nice for teething. My little loved it. Ive tried it. Has a good flavor. Id recommend giving it a try also.
--------------------
Not bad, but not sure how much it helped with teething. My child liked having these as a snack on a trip. They liked them more when they were first eating solids and not so much since.
--------------------
Excellent product for babies. My baby love the snacks and I am happy to see eating healthy
--------------------
My baby loves these. This was the first thing we gave her when she started teething and eating more solid food other than milk. It helped her get flavor and helped her learn motor skills with her hands
--------------------
Our kids seemed to love these. They are tasty and pretty much melt in your mouth. Good for early eaters because you dont have to worry about choking. My daughters fav cookie for awhile.
--------------------
Love love love these things! My baby loves to bite down on these to soothe his gums. The length of these are perfect for him to hold in his hand while he self feeds. They come in an air filled bag inside of a box to prevent breaking of the crackers which is very clever!
--------------------
I wasnt impressed by these sweet potato and banana chips. I do t think theyre good for teething infants. Maybe for bigger kids. The texture was a bit chewy and chips were super thin.
--------------------
We always used these and even make little peanut butter sandwiches out of them to get our peanut butter exposure
--------------------
My baby LOVES these teethed crackers. I think it must feel good on his teeth. He is able to hold the whole cracker and chew on the pieces, but I also feel comfortable giving them to him based on how fast it melts. I don’t worry about choking. It’s great for a snack on the road since it’s one big piece vs the little puffs which are better enjoyed in the high chair.
--------------------
T's favorite snack. She won't eat the puffs but love these. They don't have much vitamins or anything but keep her busy.
--------------------
Love these and my baby loves them. Pros, East for baby to hold. Cons- dry like concrete and stick to everything!
--------------------
These are very good for teething baby. They melted and were not hazardous to my baby and i would definitely recommend it to anyone with babies.
--------------------
My baby loves these!
--------------------
Our baby loves these!! Wonderful to take on trips . It can get messy and they will have sticky fingers.
--------------------
We really loved these with our first. I never worried about her choking because they dissolve so well. I do worry a little about how much arsenic was found in them. I loved that they helped my daughter figure out how to hold things but I am a little concerned about using them again.
--------------------
My daughter loves happy baby test hers. She loved the purple carrot ones. These were her second favorite
--------------------
My 7 month old did not like them. I had to return the other boxes.
--------------------
My babies love this. This has to be the perfect most simplest snack to give to your babies. I recommend to break into pieces to serve them but also good to have them eat as a whole.
--------------------
WHY would they add sugar to something that is meant for babies to suck on while they are teething?? This makes no sense to me. Please be aware of the label on these!
--------------------
Easy for baby to use and melt quickly in mouth. Inexpensive and packaged in packs of 2 so easy to grab for snacks/on the go!
--------------------
I purchased these for my 5 month old. So glad I did! She loves them! She has two little teeth and three more coming through, she likes to gnaw on these and it soothes her gums. They dissolve within a few seconds so you don’t have to worry about baby choking. She likes to hold it and feed herself but I stay close by so she doesn’t take too big of bites. Definitely recommend!
--------------------
The best tethers! I love Happy Baby because they have a wide variety of snacks and flavors.
--------------------
My baby loves these teething crackers. They seem to dissolve quicker and better than the puffs. She likes the feeling of it on her gums and they have helped while teething. She enjoys the flavor of them as well.
--------------------
My baby loved these. Especially while teething. It was nice for him to have something other than purées.
--------------------
My son loves these!!!! They dissolve quick aren’t sharp! They have tons of different flavors too
--------------------
My son is one year old and he absolutely love these! They're perfect for him to hold and feed himself. He currently has 7 teeth and can bite into these easily. These wafers are thin so even if your baby has less teeth, they are easy to break into smaller pieces and will melt in their mouth. Highly recommend!
--------------------
Can’t say enough about these teething wafers! Both of my kids LOVED them. Great to integrate with their first foods because they melt in their mouths and helps them with learning to feed themselves. Highly recommend to everyone.
--------------------
I have received these as a gift and I had no idea this existed my baby love them something to get them busy with I would just be careful when given to them and just watch the baby while eating them they to dissolve easily but still would be keeping an eye on the little one
--------------------
My baby had bad constipation with the Happy Baby baby food, but he loved these wafers! We have them in every flavor and he loves to bite pieces off and chew on them. He always gets excited when he knows I’m getting him a wafer!
--------------------
My baby absolutely loves these! They’re easy for him to hold and eat on his own. I love how they’re made with minimal ingredients. They are very sticky so make sure you wipe your baby well after.
--------------------
My daughter started eating these around 9 months old and they have been such a lifesaver! These are what have taught her how to hold food and bite pieces off. Also, they’re a good size so they keep her occupied for a while. I’m definitely going to have these stocked in my pantry!
--------------------
When my son first started eating solids, he was crazy for these teething wafers! I was only able to find them in a few different flavors, more variety would be nice. That being said, they are a great consistency for new eaters as they dissolve in their mouth. They come in packs of two which makes it easy to stick in the diaper bag and hit the road!
--------------------
Love these teethed wafers. Perfect thing to snack on and keep 9 month old busy while we’re out to dinner and such.
--------------------
After going through a gagging spell with textures he loves these things. BUT the only thing I will say is these things are like getting gum in hair. Anything it sticks to it’s so hard to get off so get it before it dries!!
--------------------
My baby loves these! She’s 10 months old and they’ve helped so much while she’s been teething!
--------------------
My baby loves the taste of these and they dissolve so easily I'm not worried about my baby accidentally choking.
--------------------
Love these teething wafers, so simple and my son loves just snacking on them. They easily dissolve which gets rid of my mommy worries.
--------------------
My 9 month old loves these snacks! I love how easy they melt, the price is great and packaged perfectly to fit in my purse or diaper backpack. This flavor is delicious and the ingredients are safe for my little one. Tip: for a low calorie snack I eat these as well :) #healthybaby #happybaby
--------------------
These are the best. My little ones have loved them as first foods and even as toddlers. They’re easy to chew on and dissolve quickly so I see them as a safe snack, as well
--------------------
Nice cookie! Little one loves them, but hard to travel with because they stick to everything once baby starts chewing on them
--------------------
Baby loves these. I like the few ingredients, she loves feeding herself. Great for feeding baby on the go - no mess!
--------------------
These were interesting. I have it 3 stars because my baby didn’t absolutely love them but she ate them . They were priced well though.
--------------------
This is the first snack i ever gave my baby , i would never leave my house without at least 2 of these!
--------------------
They love these when we are out an about. Give them to my twins at dinner to munch on and play with. They break easily so I don’t worry about them chocking
--------------------
These are a great go to for those first few months of BLW or combo feeding. They help teach self feeding and even babies as young as 6 months can be successful with them. They dissolve quickly which is great in the beginning. We do find that they are a little messy once they have gotten wet from baby. But what food isn’t.
--------------------
My baby love this wafers, wish they came without the apple juice and with whole grain ingredients for a healthy baby food
--------------------
My girls love these! They actually think they are cookies which is a #momwin because they are healthy. They don’t make a huge mess but they do become very sticky when wet. Perfect snacking size and great price range.
--------------------
My kiddo loves these!! He is able to hold them himself and they dissolve so I’m more confident in him eating them! He loves these as a snack and will eat them at breakfast sometimes as well.
--------------------
We haven't used the personally but my little sister did when she was younger and loved them and still talks about them
--------------------
My kids love this as a snack even as they get older.  It keeps them entertained while eating!
--------------------
My baby loves these. Super tasty and helps them while teething. I always have them on hand
--------------------
My Daughter loved these teething wafers when she was a tiny baby. We loved them so much and always got extras for grandmas house. I wish they had more flavors, but overall we loved the price and quality. I am glad to see Happy Baby in more stores.
--------------------
I feel like these are a staple in my house just like milk and butter! My children love these so much. I buy them regularly and find not all supermarkets carry them. I have found that Walmart sells them the cheapest
--------------------
My baby loves these. They are her favorite as well as the others. I eat them as well when she tries to share!
--------------------
My son literally would eat a few packs of these. Not sure if it helped with teething , but he sure did love them. I tried them and they taste like cardboard . Not sure what they like as far as flavor goes with them. But even my daughter that’s 4 would eat them.
--------------------
When my LO began to eat solids, these were great!  The dissolve very quickly and are very easy to chew, even with minimal teeth!
--------------------
This is the biggest disappointment for me from Happy Baby. We love all their products, but these wafers did not interest my little one at all. They are sticky and a pain to clean up. I know when it comes to teething, cleaning shouldn't be a priority, but when you can just give a saltine instead of a sticky mess, it is.
--------------------
My daughter loved happy baby teething wafers in every flavor! She still loves to get them if I offer them to her and she’s a year and a half old! This flavor especially!
--------------------
My son seems to really enjoy these teethers. They dissolve quickly, so I don’t worry too much about them breaking off in his mouth. He loves the flavor and I’m happy to have something more functional for him to chew on!
--------------------
My daughter enjoys these as her daily snack. They're easy to pack and bring with us whenever we go out. They also dissolve very easily
--------------------
Great teether cookie. Have bought multiple. Every flavor is good. Good price. Good ingredients. Love that it's organic.
--------------------
These are our little ones favorite treats and our go to snack. Healthy and she loves them.
--------------------
Very good for transitioning into solids and is soft and gentle on gums and new teeth. It is a little gummy and messy at times.
--------------------
Not going to lie both of my girls loved to eat those when they were growing up it was perfect for them both of them loved it
--------------------
MY LITTLE ONE IS A PICKY EATER, BUT SHE LOVES THESE BRAND OF TEETHING BISCUITS. ORGANIC AND HEALTHY! SUCH A GREAT SNACK!
--------------------
This organics Happy baby teethers is my go to products when it comes to my babies teething stage. It's gentle teething wafer and gluten free and has no artificial flavors or additives. It dissolves easily so it's safe for your little ones. I am very satisfied with this product.
--------------------
Love this brand! Love that it’s wholesome and organic and my son loves the taste! These cookies are great for first snacks because they dissolve so quickly in their mouth so they won’t choke.
--------------------
My baby’s absolute favorite quick snack! Keeps him entertained and helps with his teething aches
--------------------
This worked wonders in keeping my little one entertained and was a healthier alternative to crackers! It’s lighter and melts in your mouth after a bite so safe for babies just starting to teeth.
--------------------
Daughter loved these. With anything, it crumbles. I mean it's a cracker. But I liked the ingrediants. Loved putting f good things in her tiny body
--------------------
My favorite baby food brand!...my baby always wants more!. The flavors are yummy. Best part is that everything is organic :)
--------------------
Teething a horrible stage right? Trying many things to calm your teething baby a job in its own. I heard many great reviews about this product. The price not to bad.
--------------------
Trash so brown and nasty even though I said extra green
--------------------
Taste great! Would purchase again
--------------------
Purchased with a drive up order. The bananas were green and in good shape. They took a few days to ripen, which is typical.
--------------------
bananas over ripe and bruised
--------------------
Ordered via Drive thru pick up..never again. Bananas were really yellow and bruised.
--------------------
Love these bananas! fresh and nice
--------------------
it depends who staff picked your stuff.this one, I got it right! all bananas looked good. the ripe still right. the taste ok for organic. also cheaper than other places
--------------------
All rotten！The pickup order is really bad.
--------------------
I have never paid so much for Bananas. Why are some stores charging $1.99 per bunch and others charging $1.39 per banana? I just spent almost $9 for a bunch of bananas. Ridiculous. Can this be right?
--------------------
I keep buying these bananas in my Shipt orders and they keep showing up bad. My husband teases me and says “did you remember to buy the bananas to throw away?” I wouldn’t recommend the bananas!!
--------------------
They gave me the greenest bananas and even after 2 weeks they are hard and green
--------------------
Target Organic Bananas are my favorite. They last longer than 'regular' bananas and always taste great, nice and fresh. I buy these on a regular basis to use in my daily protein shakes!
--------------------
the bananas i recieved are over ripped and black waste of money should have just canceled this item then gove bad product
--------------------
They were just horrible
--------------------
Every single one of the bananas I received was 1/3-1/2 black on the inside, despite the peels not having turned brown yet.
--------------------
I've ordered these Drive Up multiple times and I've never had any issues. They've always been fresh and delicious, plus they're priced better than anywhere else locally.
--------------------
Bananas were great. Stayed fresh for a good amount of time. Nice amount for price.
--------------------
Not only over ripe but split open with visible mold.
--------------------
bananas were rotten I need a new bunch. this is not nice.
--------------------
Big bargain banana. I am happy.
--------------------
I’ve ordered the organic bananas for curbside several times and get good quality every time. My daughter is only allowed 1 (occasionally 2) per day and these never get over ripe before we finish the bunch. They’ve also never been under ripe when I pick them up.
--------------------
We get these often. Only twice have the bananas been soft or rotten, and Target was quick to refund. Usually, they are so fantastic, and we love the curbside produce!
--------------------
first time ordering produce with drive up and was pleasantly surprised they are all in good condition.
--------------------
Would not recommend on drive up order. I picked mins up and they are to ripe and passed its fresh point!
--------------------
Target employees.... thank you for doing the shopping. However we’re still paying customers. Would you like it if you paid and someone handed you a set of bananas that look like they had been thrown around? No. Also it seems like the days we get lucky and the bananas are decent are the days you don’t pay attention to this being 2 pounds of bananas... not 2 bananas. You’re going to lose revenue refunding everyone for lack of the full 2lbs or receipt of crappy bananas if you don’t start fixing the quality of shopping them or find a better way to store them. Please fix. Thank you.
--------------------
These are always fresh and delicious.
--------------------
Perfectly picked. No bruises - used Shipt.
--------------------
I must be the only one with an issue when it came to my bananas.. it was like I left a note asking for the brownest almost moldy bananas in the store. I use the app for convenience but when it comes to groceries I think I’ll choose either a different store or pick them myself
--------------------
We get these all the time and they never disappoint. The kids love them.
--------------------
When I buy bananas here there always so fresh and ready to eat.
--------------------
We order these a lot because they are fresh & yellow-green. :)
--------------------
Love these very fresh need my protein￼ Very good healthy snack or for breakfast￼.
--------------------
I was putting some in my cart and I was just a little confused why there was 44 reviews on BANANAS lol.
--------------------
Ordered online and they looked like they picked perfect ones that would ripen some more. I usually pick my bananas on the greener side. These weren't that sweet at all and I'm waiting to see if they sweeten up. I froze some and fried some. They aren't really ready to mash up in pancakes yet. Overall I give them a 3, they're usually really good bananas yet this time I didn't understand what happened. The price is awesome, maybe it was a bad shipment. I'll give it another try.
--------------------
Bananas came in great condition!
--------------------
Always great when I shop in store. Better value than non-organic.
--------------------
Target has the best bananas. They stay fresh much longer than any other bananas. The taste is great and the price is really great for the quality. Only place i buy bananas from.
--------------------
Quality was great, but the photo is deceiving. The quantity says 1, but the photo & price show multiple bananas. I did order pickup & realized I only had one banana when I got home.
--------------------
They actually taste better than regular bananas and they cost less.
--------------------
I’ve ordered the organic bananas through Shipt and purchased in store and have never had a problem with quality.
--------------------
Cheap and delicious!
--------------------
I ordered two 2 lb organic bananas online for pick up. When we arrived home and took them out of the bags I was shocked at the condition. I like my bananas firm and these were well past their peak. They were soft and bruised all over. I was disappointed and angry. The employee who picked these was very inconsiderate. They shouldn't even be selling bananas in this terrible condition. I wanted a refund but was offered a gift card. I had to drive back to the store and I gave them back their sorry bananas.
--------------------
I was surprised to see the negative reviews on here. I get my organic bananas from Target twice a month and haven't had any issues. I haven't even seen over-ripe bananas hanging in the store. Very weird. I think most of the bad experiences with bananas comes with deliveries where you can't pick out your own bananas. If you are getting bananas delivered and they end up overripe and/or bruised, make some banana bread.  I'd recommend these but only if you can pick them out in the store. Getting produce via delivery rarely works out.
--------------------
Ordered delivery today and ordered bananas organic
They arrived severely bruised and over ripened
Not even organic they are regular delmonte company
--------------------
Had bananas delivered with my order and they were delicious! They were the perfect ripeness.
--------------------
Not organic, I had to throw them away. Not happy ordering online.
--------------------
I just bought some bananas and sent them to my friends house
--------------------
The bananas are already rotting.
--------------------
don't send bananas if they're all battered and bruised
--------------------
Bananas were in poor condition
--------------------
Every single one, fell right off the stem. Now I have 6 brown, mushy bananas that I can’t eat.
--------------------
Usually the bananas that I purchase are perfect, this last order I created that was delivered via Shipt were not good at all.  They had no taste and the texture of them was unusual.  They were very hard to peel. I am starting to wonder if they were frozen at one time.  The upshot of the deal is that I threw them away.  I was bummed out, I love bananas.
--------------------
Two of the bananas were brown & mushy on the inside - half of each - tossed both of them!!!
--------------------
The bananas were covered in black spots and smushed inside. We had to throw them out.
--------------------
The store has an array of different levels of ripening available. I like my bananas more green than brown and was very happy with the purchase. The bananas were in good form and did not develop bruises or anything else from the store. They go great in smoothies and ripened slower than other bananas which is great so they do not go bad too quickly.
--------------------
I always thought "organic" was a gimmick. They stay fresh longer than regular bananas and taste better. These bananas taste wonderful even when they are ugly on outside and that includes buying them when they look grey. I will never go back to buying the other ones.
--------------------
Poor quality and old. Not fresh.
--------------------
Quality is not good dont buy it
--------------------
Tasty banana chips at a nice price!
--------------------
This product was not good.. It has no flavor at all.
--------------------
These tasted really good but wish there was more in the bag!
--------------------
These are super delicious and such a healthier alternative. We love them nice and fresh, crunchy and tasty!!
--------------------
They are fine for the price I feel. I just wish there had non-sweet versions of this. Just plain (with salt) or salt/pepper version. Considering how sweet these are, I'm not going to buy it again.
--------------------
Taste great! Only issues are price (expensive for a little bit) and super thick plaster packaging for an "eco-friendly" product.
--------------------
These are so delicious!! These banana bites have just the right amount of chewiness and chocolate to banana ratio. They make a satisfying healthier treat and are perfect for dark chocolate lovers!
--------------------
Different. A tasty combo of bananas and dark chocolate. And they're organic!
--------------------
Perfect taste, great dark chocolate, chewy bananas. 10/10 recommend
--------------------
My kids love the gogo squeez applesauce pouches. Perfect for on the go and school lunches.
--------------------
I love this applesauce! It’s tasty and doesn’t have a lot of added sugars!
--------------------
My almost one year old loves these. Please make more flavors or offer these at bulk!
--------------------
Older child (elem school) loves this flavor. Easy to pack for lunch or snack!
--------------------
my daughter tasted it, accepted a few bites, and that was it. it is very sweet, pudding consistency.
--------------------
The banana-pumpkin baby food pouch is my daughter's favorite. She is now 2.5 years old, and this pouch makes a great snack when we are in the car and she is hungry. I do wish that there was a way to buy these in bulk (and at a bulk discount).
--------------------
Food order came very quick and was packed very well. Was very happy with order.
--------------------
The toddler food is a great way to feed them a good and healthy meal.
--------------------
Good, simple baby food. My one year old son enjoyed it. There’s nothing hidden, just simple ingredients, apple and banana, and nothing more. I don’t like the plastic container though. I’d prefer a glass container. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My youngest granddaughter is just starting to eat all these new foods and flavors. I bought her the Apple Banana Oatmeal since I would have her for a few days. She had her mouth open the whole time I was feeding this flavored Oatmeal. She is not really fond of plain oatmeal and we are lucky to get her to eat a few bites. But this tasty oatmeal she just kept eating without any problems. I tasted it myself and the flavor was very pleasing. The fruit flavors blended without overpowering each other. The oatmeal has a slight nutty flavor. Its not too thick that a child at sitting stage would have any issues with. The only thing I would like is if this was available in the two packs. We will be buying this oatmeal and the other new flavors. We also like the convenience of having the fruit and oatmeal premixed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

She eats this every morning now. I love that Gerber is a family trusted brand ! I know she is getting the vitamins and nutrients that she needs for her growing body.. Highly recommended product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

We searched the Gerber products to find the few that offer really good nutrition (i.e. multiple vitamins and minerals at good DV%), and tried them all. This was one of those, and our 10-month old girl loved the flavor also.
--------------------
Easy cereal for when we are in a rush. My child loves the taste
--------------------
Delicious!! I tried this just to make sure it was good enough for my little one and it didn’t take artificial or weird at all! Very much a banana taste and I like the jars, I usually reuse and wash them, so I can put the leftover food from the plastic baby food containers in these and heat them up as needed. They do seem a bit more pricey but worth it for the taste and the reusable jar.
--------------------
cute little jars of yumminess.
--------------------
Most of the Ferber 1st food are a bit runny and hard to keep in my sons mouth, but this one has just the right consistency
--------------------
I was so excited for my son to try bananas and I was sure he was just going to love them. Unfortunately he didn’t like what I am guessing is the lemon juice that is added. He made a terrible face and wouldn’t eat it. I tried homemade baby food with just the bananas and he loved it. Oh well can’t win them all !
--------------------

Wow, Gerber! What a fantastic food. When it’s time to eat, our baby just loves your natural banana baby food. I have noticed that she really seems to love the taste.

We also love the fact that this food has no added ingredients making it just right for our bundle of joy. Good job Gerber. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Gerber has always been a company our family knows and trusts. I fed my son this jar of banana naturals and he went wild over the flavor wanting more after finishing his jar. I love how everything is natural in this jar of baby food and how pleasantly smelling it is, the texture was very creamy and smooth making it easy for him to eat. I highly recommend!!

My toddler loves these pouches. They're perfect for on the go and easy to store. It's perfectly blended and she loves the taste of it. I can taste every ingredient in it and I like that it's organic. I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My daughter loved this and gobbled it right up. We've had some of the other flavors in the past and she's enjoyed those as well. I do like that the containers are clear so you can see the inside and what's really in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I think that the protein content in this pouch helps to keep my toddler from getting hungry again too quickly. These pouches are so useful to throw into the diaper bag to have on hand as an emergency snack, but most of them are just fruit or vegetable and don't seem to fill my 15 month toddler's tummy for very long. This mixture adds bean (any maybe the chia) to give it more protein then most pouches and this seems to be more satisfying-- more toddler doesn't get hungry again as quickly. It tastes ok to me and my toddler seems to like it (but he also eats dirt, so he doesn't have the most refined palate). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
So I received this product a while back and been getting this ever since. This tastes so amazing. This flavor is by far the best flavor to me and I definitely recommend this product to anyone. It also tastes way better when it is really cold. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My 2 year old daughter loves the taste of this Plum Organics Mighty Protein & Fiber Banana, White Bean, Strawberry & Chia snack. She loves all of the flavors, actually. I will continue buying and definitely recommend to all of my friends who are parents. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
These are awesome, convenient and delicious! The only downside is he eats more than one at a time because there aren't much in them and that makes it kind of expensive. I'll continue to buy them though since he's very picky and at a stubborn age. He's thirteen months and pickier than ever. I LOVE THAT YOU CAN JUST THROW SOME IN THE DIAPER BAG AND GO.. It makes snack time so simple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

These are some of our favorite "snacks", if you will. We have three kids (5yrs, 3yrs, and 2yrs) and they love these for on-the-go. They don't require anything extra, we can throw them in our bag and take them with anywhere. The kids love the taste, they are healthy for them, easy to use pouches, and no mess. We always have them on hand! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My son hate baby food. I don’t honestly know why. I’m guessing he see us eat and wants to eat the same thing we eat. But he did eat this. I’m assuming it’s because it in a drink like pouch. But I’m not sure. It’s easy to open and easy to close. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I guess all of my child’s baby food before I give it to him. Despite the ingredients which make it seem like they wouldn’t be good together it is pretty good and it’s a nice snack I’ll turn it up instead of you know the typical snacks that I gave him this is a fruit salad cookies and things like that I think it’s a healthy alternative to could have. I like that it’s easy to open and easy to sell and I like that it’s easier for him to handle and it get to you so the idea of a strong without actually being a strong he only drink half of it one day and half the night at 16 months he did notDrink it all in one sitting but it’s definitely a product that I would recommend and I will be purchasing more of these in the future for our house.One more thing I forgot to mention I love the pouches clear so that you can see exactly what’s in the pouch that’s a great benefit.
