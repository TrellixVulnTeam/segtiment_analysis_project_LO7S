It wasn’t terrible, but there weren’t very many cookie pieces.
--------------------
as a ben & jerrys fanatic it is crazy to say this is the most craveable ice cream I've ever purchased
--------------------
Wow! This is my new favorite Cookies & Cream ice cream! It's loaded with cookies and the ice cream is wonderfully creamy. The entire family enjoys it & it's not a regular item on my shopping list.
--------------------
Best cookies and cream ice cream I’ve ever had!
--------------------
My Kids and I really liked this ice cream Cookies n creme❤️❤️
--------------------
Basically vanilla ice cream, tiny specks of cookies. Not sure if we got a bad one but will not be buying this again.
--------------------
I loaded up on several containers of Cookies n Cream and Mint Chocolate Chip today. I read the reviews which were excellent for the Cookies and mixed for the Mint. Price was regular $2.99 for 1.5 gallon, quite fair in July. The taste and texture is a excellent and the cookies taste fresh and robust and ample quantity mixture. I would ignore any negative reviews as they’re likely from competitors. This is a great value you won’t be disappointed. Btw, other flavors like Java Chip and Moose Tracks are prices higher over $4.
--------------------
This best cookies n cream I've ever had!!!
--------------------
Market Pantry has the best tasting ice cream, this one is my favorite.
--------------------
Delicious! I’d never tried this brand of ice cream before. It’s great! Creamy, not too soft or airy, good chunks of cookie, great price. I’d definitely get this again
--------------------
This ice cream is fantastic. Despite the fact that I shop at Target A LOT, and I adore ice cream, I had never bought the Market Pantry ice cream. However, one day at a SuperTarget they were offering samples of this flavor, and I had to try it. I was amazed at how creamy and delicious it was. I was sold. I bought a container and my husband enjoyed a bowl with me, and he also really liked it. This ice cream doesn't skimp on the cookie pieces or the flavor. I'm impressed with the quality and taste, especially for the price. Great ice cream! I'm looking forward to trying other flavors.
--------------------
This is my favorite brand. The taste is amazing especially ice cream with cookies love it.
--------------------
Very sub par taste and texture + not really ice cream (try letting it melt) with ingredient list a mile long. Threw away after tasting, would not buy again.
--------------------
The best most creamy cookie dough ice cream I’ve ever had!!!
--------------------
Cookie dough ice cream is my favorite and I have found the Market Pantry brand to be the best! It has TONS of cookie dough in it! I occasionally buy the brand names from the grocery store when they are bogo, and then I always lament that I did. A few months ago I bought one of the ultra fancy brands (was about $7 for a half gallon) and there were FIVE medium size pieces of cookie dough in the whole container! The whole time I ate through that container I was mad at myself for spending that much money. I felt ripped off. I don’t feel that way with this brand! It’s not all about the cookie dough, though. The ice cream itself is delicious and creamy, too!
--------------------
Great price for a great product! Much cheaper than Blue Bell and always in stock at my location.
--------------------
This ice cream was surprisingly delicious and a great value! I normally splurge on name brand ice creams but I was feeling thrifty and was in a hurry. I’m actually pretty picky about my cookie dough and didn’t have great expectations, but the other reviewers said it was good so I gave it a shot. Wow! TONS of cookie dough and the vanilla flavor of the ice cream was on point! If I could offer any criticism it would be that I wish there were more chocolate chunks, but the excess cookie dough more than made up for that so I didn’t even knock off a star. I will definitely be returning to buy this brand again!!
--------------------
This is the best cookie dough ice cream I've ever had. I usually find myself disappointed in the amount of cookie dough in my ice cream but this ice cream has the perfect amount. The low price is also nice.
--------------------
Very addictive like a previous reviewer said! I was hooked on it for 4 months straight ..But very yummy especially the cookie dough ! Lol can’t go wrong with this ice cream!
--------------------
I love this ice cream! They're extremely generous with the cookie dough bits. There's a spoonful of deliciousness in every bite. Can't get enough of it. Be prepared to get hooked. Once you start, it's hard to stop. Not kidding!
--------------------
This is a follow up review of different flavor than I wrote last week, also similar 5 stars for Mint Chocolate Chip and Cookies n Cream. We live in an ice cream family in an ice cream state, California. I purchased this container at a local store in Sherman Oaks. The taste, texture and color are excellent. The base is creamy and smooth, the chips are semi sweet hard, and the cookie dough is flavorful but not overly sugary. Anyone who likes this flavor should enjoy this ice cream. Price is reasonable $2.99 which is the lower price line at Target, others like Moose Tracks are over $4. Don’t waste your money on expensive fancy brands with their gimmicks. This is a very good, tasty and economical choice for anyone who has good taste regardless of budget.
--------------------
This is such amazing ice cream and a great price. Lots of cookie dough bits and the vanilla ice cream is perfect. The chocolate chips are yummy. This is our new family favorite!
--------------------
This is the beat cookie dough ice cream ever with a lot of cookie dough and chocolate chips. Great price too. I won’t be buying any other kind
--------------------
They constantly sell out everytime within a week when the stores get it. I rarely see it in the store, but when they do its the best feeling in the world. I did not like Cookie Dough until I tasted this ice cream.
--------------------
Literally the BEST vanilla ice cream I’ve ever had! I like vanilla but usually load it up with toppings. This is so creamy with such an authentic vanilla bean taste I want to eat it plain. Try it, you won’t be sorry!!
--------------------
We usually are an exclusively Bryer’s family but I couldn’t justify the cost versus the grocery store on this particular Target run. Got this instead and I must say I shouldn’t have been surprised at the quality and taste particularly from Target. The ice cream was excellent and we’ve been converted!
--------------------
So creamy and well balanced!
--------------------
I bought this vanilla bean ice cream as a shot in the dark because I haven’t found a vanilla ice cream that I’m brand loyal to. I was very surprised and I can honestly say that this vanilla bean ice cream is the BEST I’ve ever had. It’s creamy with a really good vanilla taste. I usually like richer ice cream and choose chocolate, but I got this vanilla to pair with an apple dessert and I’ve been choosing this over chocolate! I don’t add any toppings, just eat it as is. Definitely worth a try if you’re on the hunt for a good vanilla ice cream.
--------------------
Taste so good!!!! (If you love Starbucks vanilla bean Frappuccino, then you will definitely love this!) and the price for this ice cream is average
--------------------
This ice cream is amazing. Definitely as good as the better known ice cream brands.
--------------------
Best ice cream ever!!! And for the price you can't beat it! Creamy, doesnt get icey in the freezer and not too heavy! delicious my favorite ice cream ever
--------------------
Best ice cream ever. Will never buy name brand again and we love vanilla bean ice cream.
--------------------
At 1st I thought it would replace the name brand ice cream, which I love. Unfortunately, it has an after taste quiet salty of some sort. I'm peaky with my ice cream and I'm just going to stick with the name brand.
--------------------
I'm new to reviews, but I love to read they because they are helpful. This is the first item I chose to review. I wait until I can get to Target to buy this ice cream - vanilla regular. It is better than ANY other ice cream we have tried - all name brands - even expensive ones. Superb in a root beer float! I can live with the high fructose corn syrup. Try this product.
--------------------
Great tasting ice cream sandwich to bring you back to the old days. Nice vanilla flavor and the sandwich cookies do not stick to your hands, which is an improvement! wish they came in regular sizes, not just mini.
--------------------
Delicious! As good as any other name brand ones. We buy at least one box a week. Although these say mini, I feel they’re about 3/4 the size of a full-sized ice cream sandwich. They are a good size for still being “mini”.
--------------------
These are perfect for my kids! I tried them also and they taste just like any other icecream sandwich. Good price too! Will definitely be purchasing again.
--------------------
Tidy-size treat with classic flavor.
--------------------
These are a great size and tasty! The chocolate biscuit part has good chocolate flavor.  Great for kids and portion control.
--------------------
These are your traditional yummy vanilla ice cream sandwich. The mini size is fantastic for the kids. They feel like they are getting a treat and I am happy it isn't the size of their head!
--------------------
I ate the Breyer's chocolate ice cream in the 1970's and 1980's stopped eating it because of my eating disorder anorexia.... I am eating it it's very very very good....
--------------------
I noticed the carton of Breyers Mint Chocolate Chip did not taste quite right and was disappointed to discover that the packaging did not say ice cream anywhere. I want real ice cream. This, to my surprise, was subtly labeled “ frozen dairy dessert”. I used to like Breyers and I hope there will be a return to the former ingredients so it tastes like I remember it! It was wonderful before the change.
--------------------
Breyer's Chocolate is easily the best chocolate ice cream. Curious though, why the added ingredients of whey and vegetable gum? You used to market heavily on the fact this is nothing but milk, cream, sugar and cocoa.
--------------------
Thank you. Now that I've found Breyers clean, pure ice-cream I don't want any other products on the market.
--------------------
I loved your ice cream especially the lactose free. Is so delicious, and do not make sick at all. I lved. Finally, i can enjoy ice cream again. Thanks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This ice cream is really smooth and the chocolate is kind of rich but if you like chocolate itll be fine. Its a little bit expensive for ice cream but thats fine if you have the extra money to spend. It tastes really good so if I were you I would try it out.Breyers
--------------------
Ice cream is probably my absolute FAVORITE dessert in the world and I'll tell you what, this chocolate ice cream is my fav! Unlike others, you can actually taste the chocolate
--------------------
If I could I would give Breyers a 10 * I was raised on Breyers ice cream only because of that I will eat nothing else. No other ice cream taste like Breyers their chocolate is the best compared to every other ice cream place they are a little pricey but I think it's worth it
--------------------
It's the best and creamiest ice cream I've ever tasted the varieties are excellent.
--------------------
Love this smooth chocolate ice cream from Breyer, put behind my diet for a second while it melt in my mouth
--------------------
Creamy, smooth and flavorful. The chocolate flavor is very strong but not bitter. I made malts with it and it was a big hit.
--------------------
This is a flavor my whole family enjoys... its a tad pricey for the amount but not awful and so worth it!
--------------------
My number 1 favorite ice cream to eat since I was a little girl. Definitely a repeat consumer, I buy more everytime I run low.
--------------------
Reward yourself with this dessert! The Chocolate tastes like no other brand... It's my go to and unfortunately it doesn't last long. The only way to improve it, would be to make the container bigger for the same price! Slides down your throat effortlessly and brings a smile to your face at the same time!
--------------------
Brewers chocolate is one of those classic ice creams that you keep on buying. The size is great and it gives you much more ice cream than other companies. This chocolate flavor isnt overwhelming it is a great basic ice cream for partys or a hangout with friends.
--------------------
This is my new favorite ice cream! Ive been buying Breyers ever since trying this because I wanted to see if any other flavor owned up to this one! This has to be the creamiest and freshest tasting chocolate ice cream Ive ever had. Hands down. I highly recommend!
--------------------
Nothing and I mean nothing beats Breyers ice cream. I can eat all of that in one sitting while watching a movie. absolutely immaculate.
--------------------
I live in a chocolate loving household . Thus this is a well known name you see in our feeezer all the time . Great taste
--------------------
I love chocolate ice cream especially this brand because this bread is very affordable. I would not improve the product because it taste very good and it was not disappointing at all and I would definitely buy it again!
--------------------
I love this brand Chocolate is the best we get it all the time I like putting it in waffle cones it's very creamy and delicious there is nothing I would improve on is a rich deep chocolate flavour
--------------------
Left a bitter cocoa taste. I miss the pure milk chocolate taste.
--------------------
Such a great chocolate ice cream. It has great flavor and texture. We also like to use this ice cream for milkshakes!
--------------------
This is one of my favorite ice cream brands because the chocolate taste very rich and is delicious.
--------------------
The silkiest smooth chocolate flavor in town. Love it so much. Definitely a go to whenever Im craving ice cream at the grocery store
--------------------
This is a classic. Like always a crowd pleaser, good alone or good with something else like a brownie. You will never be disappointed with this classic.
--------------------
Breyers Creamery Style Chocolate is simple, but delicious. The chocolate flavour is distinct and the consistency is both creamy and rich. It should be noted that flavour comes from real cocoa and all of the flavours and colours come from natural sources. The cream is also fresh, antibiotic free, and gluten free.
--------------------
Honestly one of my fav chocolate ice creams on the market. Very smooth and great flavor, super creamy. Cant go wrong with this choice at all
--------------------
This is my all time favorite chocolate ice cream to buy at the store. Its super cheap for the amount given and the taste and texture is amazing.
--------------------
I've always love Breyers Ice Cream until the last few times I bought the chocolate flavor. It use to taste like chocolate fudge almost, now it barely even tastes like chocolate. PLEASE bring back the old chocolate flavor.
--------------------
This ice cream is delicious.. its rich and creamy! One of the main reasons I purchase this is because its gluten free- my daughter and I both have a gluten allergy so its nice to know that we can enjoy this treat without getting sick.
--------------------
I love eating this Ice cream because it's healthy and makes my stomach not too full compared to the other companies , and it helps a lot with the digestive system , I always buy from this company and I'll continue do it . I recommend for you people to enjoy the spring and summer time
--------------------
This is the only ice cream I eat. I only like chocolate ice cream. Its cheap too and you can get this from most of the grocery store.
--------------------
Breyer's Chocolate has a decent chocolate flavour. It's more of a milk chocolate ice cream. One thing I would love to see them do for their chocolate line would be to offer either a milk and dark chocolate swirl ice cream or a dark chocolate ice cream for a bolder chocolate flavour.
--------------------
This is so smooth and rich, but not too rich that you cant have more. This is the OG and its so delicious. I prefer just plain chocolate on its own, but this is also good base with add ins!
--------------------
Breyers chocolate ice cream isnt really good because its too creamy and it just doesnt look really fresh when I always buy it and it has this weird after taste. Also it is too much for the actual ice cream and I think they can do better.
--------------------
When you think of chocolate ice cream this is what you think of. Great taste and texture
--------------------
This icecream has an outstanding taste and it is perfect for the Summer! The packaging has leaked before so just be mindful of that when you but this brands cream.
--------------------
Ive cream has got to be my go to snack in the summer. Its so creamy and the taste is soo rich
--------------------
This chocolate flavor Ive cream is sooo delicious!! I love chocolate flavor and not to mention they have a lot of other food flavors available.
--------------------
This is so rich and delicious! I dont buy it super often because it is on the pricier side of ice cream.
--------------------
Ooooo these are sooo good. I dont keep ice cream at home on a regular basic. I only get it at certain occasions. Ever since I tried Breyers Chocolate havent gone back to anything else. Ive tried different flavors but chocolate is my favorite. They are so rich and thick but just melts in your mouth. So good
--------------------
Best tasting ice cream brand out there. Great to have when you need that ice cream fixing.
--------------------
Best chocolate ice cream period. Never can go wrong with it. It tastes amazing I always buy this brand everytime I want a good treat. You can never go wrong with the sprinkles either. I highly recommend and will buy again!
--------------------
just had my wisdom teeth out and this is what i ate! it is so good mixed with oreos!
--------------------
A nice well-rounded chocolate, not overpowering or cheap. Decently priced. Taste good.
--------------------
Great classic taste. Good quality ingredients. Good price. Simple and what you expect!
--------------------
This a great creamy chocolate ice cream high quality simple delicious ingredients make great product the only thing is I would like to see maybe a organic version or non dairy version with all of the best quality ingredients that this version has
--------------------
Best chocolate ice cream could never go wrong with having chocolate ice cream .. its texture is so soft and delicious I highly recommend to try
--------------------
The only ice cream brand I will eat. Chocolate is my favorite, Im not a fan of vanilla but I actually dont mind their vanilla ice cream either. So smooth and tastes good!
--------------------
I love me some ice cream, especially chocolate. The chocolate flavor is rich and sweet. Easy to throw in some chopped fruit or sprinkles.
--------------------
Love this product! Have been using it for many years! Would deff Recommend to anyone!
--------------------
chocolate ice cream is my favorite flavor of ice cream but the chocolate in this was just underwhelming. i ended up putting it in the blender with some chocolate milk for a milkshake and that was great
--------------------
Love love love the creamy texture of breyers icecreams and who doesnt love a good classic chocolate! Perfect by itself or you could jazz it up with toppings of your choice! Delicious
--------------------
Being a chocolate lover, they have the creamiest chocolate ice ever. I have it by itself and other items
--------------------
I love this ice cream. I dont know what it is but I always get this brand and flavor. Its creamy and no to sweet or has a after taste its just taste like frozen chocolate.
--------------------
Love chocolate, its a favorite for me whether Im eating ice cream, cake, candy, etc. chocolate is always the way to go! Breyers definitely makes one of the best chocolate ice creams! Its always very fresh, it has a natural chocolate taste that isnt over sweetened like some others. I really enjoy this brand and this flavor!
--------------------
This icecream is AMAZING! This is mostly the only brand my family eats. Its creamy and smooth and tastes great.
--------------------
One of my all-time favorite ice creams. They used to have absolutely nothing but all natural ingredients 10 to 15 years ago. The formulation has changed quite a bit so the flavor has been affected a little bit over time. But this is one of my favorites.
--------------------
My favorite classic flavor. And breyers always has simple ingredients that make a delicious ice cream.
--------------------
This is one of my favourite kinds of ice cream. It is simple yes delicious. I recommend.
--------------------
I love chocolate. Its my favorite flavor and Breyers is so smooth and delicious! I would definitely get it again
--------------------
Such a delicious ice cream. I've tried several other brands and I always go back to this one. It's my absolute favorite.
--------------------
Great ice cream. It's creamy and just delicious. I dont really know how to review ice cream. Lol. It's really good though
--------------------
Breyers chocolate is delicious. I like Breyers ice cream because it tasted very natural.
--------------------
This ice cream was super creamy and loaded with chocolate flavor. We buy the Breyer's chocolate ice cream a couple times a month because we just love it. Great price for what you get.
--------------------
Breyers has so much flavor and is so rich and creamy! All the flavors are so good and honestly I love having this on a rainy day at home! Its so good and if you do it on a warm cookie or brownie its to die for!
--------------------
Breyers Chocolate Ice Cream is so creamy & rich. The chocolate flavor is full-bodied. It is one of those treats you just want to use a spoon & enjoy the whole carton.
--------------------
I used to get this ice cream a lot a year ago but not any more . After I tried tillamook I cant eat any other ice cream
--------------------
There is nothing better than classic chocolate ice cream. This truly the best chocolate Ive cream I have ever had. Love it!
--------------------
Chocolate ice cream is so delicious and refreshing for me ! I can eat the whole tub to myself
--------------------
In the world of chocolate ice cream you have Breyers and then everybody else. Best brand of chocolate ice cream on the market BY FAR. Dont make the mistake of not buying Breyers.
--------------------
Never stored properly in-store so is off when it gets home
--------------------
This is the best chocolate ice cream I have ever tasted. Its not too sweet, but it has just the right amount of savory and sweet mix. Very creamy and thaws very nicely. Would definitely recommend others to buy this.
--------------------
I generally stick with Breyers brand ice cream or Blue Bell. They are guaranteed good flavors.
--------------------
We had ice cream today for my oldest daughter birthday. I love this ice cream. It tastes fresh. It is priced a little high but the taste makes up for that. If you haven't tried Breyers ice cream, you should buy it today.
--------------------
Delicious smooth creamy chocolate ice cream! Not too sweet. Had wonderful flavour and great price! Definitely reccomend it!
--------------------
This is the creamiest ice cream that we have found. Our family just Breyers ice cream because of its simple ingredients
--------------------
I love this ice cream! Real flavor and just a few ingredients
--------------------
Love Breyers ice cream and their chocolate flavor is a great option when youre looking for a classic.
--------------------
We love the carb smart ice cream. Especially the chocolate. It does not taste any different than the regular.
--------------------
Always so creamy and smooth. Close to soft serve in a carton. The lactose free version taste identical.
--------------------
Just amazing Chocolate Ice Cream. The only better one out there is Breyers Dark Chocolate with truffles
--------------------
A staple in our freezer no matter what time of year. Always great taste. Goes good alone or paired with cake, pies or in a shake!
--------------------
Great taste at a great price. Very high quality brand so you know what youre getting. I would highly recommend based on price effectiveness and quality.
--------------------
My favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate and in my opinion Breyers makes the best ice cream
--------------------
I cant be the only one who thinks Brewers sucks major lumps. Its hardly even ice cream, its just whipped cream. Its so light and airy and it doesnt even freeze fully, which makes me think theres hardly any real dairy. Its not that cheap either. Booooo.
--------------------
Classic chocolate ice cream. It is an absolute family favorite in my home. The only issue is the container has gotten smaller and the price has gone up- will only buy on sale!
--------------------
Pretty good. Not my favorite. I like Haagen daas instead to be honest. Their sugar free flavors are pretty good.
--------------------
Breyers chocolate ice cream is the ONLY brand to get. Ive loved this brand for as long as i can remember.
--------------------
Like what I said I dont have anything to complain about chocolate. This ice cream taste so good and not that sweet. Its so milky and creamy.
--------------------
I hate to say it but this is not my favorite brand of ice cream. Its not creamy enough and I am not a fan of the chocolate flavoring.
--------------------
Hands down the absolutely best ice cream ever. No matter the flavor. This ice cream brand never fails
--------------------
My boyfriend loves chocolate ice cream and we can always rely on breyers being available in the grocery store. The price is middle-end and is fair for what you get. The ice cream isnt fancy but its just what you need after a long day.
--------------------
Delicious ice cream, the kids love it the husband loves it! This is the best selection of this brand. Would buy this one over and over again.
--------------------
Not bad at all. Ate like half a container of chocolate the other night while binge watching TV. I do like others better but it's good ice cream and affordable
--------------------
Good tasting ice cream but doesnt have a bold chocolate flavor.It can be pricey but the brand itself offers good quality ice cream.I would still buy this product but I think it needs more of a chocolate flavor.
--------------------
Best ice cream ! Taste sooo good and refreshing on a hot summer day in Florida. Its delicious and affordable.
--------------------
I love it! My son and I eat the Pb & Chocolate all the time! Our favorite snack of the night!
--------------------
Yum!! This Breyers chocolate ice cream is rich and creamy and makes a fantastic milk shake. The only downside is a container used to fill my blender to make enough for everyone. They don't put as much in their containers as they used to. No brand does sadly, yet they all still charge the same or more. It barely fills my blender above the half way mark. Boooo Breyers.
--------------------
Soft and creamy and just plain out delicious. A decent price and is always so good. Ever since I was a kid this has been my favorite. I definitely recommend this.
--------------------
It’s great vanilla ice cream for the value but not the absolute best I’ve tried out there but you get what you pay for
--------------------
My family has eaten Breyers natural vanilla for nearly 20 years. We stayed with the product even after fillers were added, but out of shear curiosity, I noticed today that the box no longer lists vanilla as an ingredient and instead says natural flavors. Does the Breyers Natural Vanilla use castoreum?
--------------------
My husband talked me into trying your brand of Vanilla Ice Cream. After one bite, I spit it out and threw away the rest. I Put it into the sink to melt, came back three hours laters and it was still sitting there pretty much intact. After spraying with warm water, some of it melted, but left a chunky, foamy layer in the strainer. Some pieces are still there after an overnight sit in the sink!
--------------------
You can taste the vanilla it‚Äôs really good. I‚Äôm a ice cream fanatic so this def ranks pretty high and it‚Äôs a standard flavor
--------------------
Amazing flavor. My favorite ice cream flavor is vanilla and it‚Äôs just something about this specific one that just makes you happy when you eat it.
--------------------
I thought the vanilla flavor was bland and it didn‚Äôt really taste like vanilla it had a different taste
--------------------
Vanilla is my go to flavor when I want a sweet treat after a meal. Breyers is great because the ingredients are simple, you can really taste the vanilla and it doesn't leave a greasy aftertaste in your mouth.
--------------------
Yummm. I would hate to admit how much ice cream I have consumed in my lifetime. But it is my favorite dessert, my favorite snack, and my favorite late-night treat. So I speak from some expertise, having eaten a lot of this frozen confection. Vanilla is still one of my favorite flavors, and Breyers does it right. Great texture is the major part of the mouth feel, and Breyers ice cream is perfect texture, straight from the freezer.
--------------------
Breyers Natural Vanilla is always a hit! The tub is very reliable, however, recently we have been buying the individual cups and the vanilla has been very disappointing. The chocolate still rocks though! If we need vanilla from now on we‚Äôll stick to the tub:)
--------------------
10/10!!! This is hands down the best vanilla ice cream out there and you cannot fight me on it. It has such a bold and creamy flavor! I have been eating this since I was little and you seriously can‚Äôt go wrong with any of their flavors. Go try this!!
--------------------
Its vanilla, what can go wrong. It has the perfect balance of cream to vanilla and doesnt get as easily freezer burnt compared to other brands. I would definitely buy it again, vanilla goes with everything, especially hot holiday desserts.
--------------------
When you want a homemade creamy taste that‚Äôs good and worth it. It‚Äôs pricey but worth it.
--------------------
Overall, my favorite brand of ice cream! I could literally eat the entire carton!! It‚Äôs so creamy and smooth and has the perfect flavor, it‚Äôs the go to for sure
--------------------
I love it! Smooth, creamy, cold. Goes with any topping and I can share with my doggo!
--------------------
Love the taste of this natural vanilla flavor. Normally I add toppings to my vanilla flavored ice cream but I could eat this alone it‚Äôs so good!
--------------------
Tastes amazing. Just a slight hint of that homemade vanilla taste. Reasonably priced for the quality of the ice cream. Would definitely buy again. Great with fruit for toppings.
--------------------
Hands down one of the best vanilla ice creams out there. It taste more natural than other brand and is super rich and creamy without being too heavy. Love it plain or added to apple pie. Perfection! One of my favorite ice creams of all time. I would buy this again and again.
--------------------
The only ice cream I will eat, specifically Natural Vanilla. There is no brand, from low to highest end, that is as good or acceptable to me. Their Natural Vanilla has been the only one I eat for years.
--------------------
Such a good vanilla taste. I love using this ice cream on top of a slice of warm pie or cobble! It takes the place of whipped cream and is delicious.
--------------------
Like the flavor and the texture of this product. It also seems to have less sugar than other brands. I would recommend any of the flavors.
--------------------
Absolutely my favorite ice cream in the world. Has more of a real homemade ice cream texture than any I‚Äôve ever tried. Yes even better than Blue Bell. It has a richer natural vanilla bean flavor. It‚Äôs wonderful topped with your own favorites. I love walnuts and chocolate toppings or fresh strawberries but most of the time I take it just as it is.
--------------------
Always good. Always a classic. Our families go to vanilla ice cream. Smooth, creamy and very delicious!!
--------------------
Bryers natural vanilla is named perfectly! It tastes so natural. You can actually taste the vanilla beans in it.
--------------------
Very flavorful vanilla ice cream. Nice and creamy. Love that they have a gluten free option - yes most other ice creams do contain some wheat. Wish it was more affordable or had a larger size for the price. Would buy again based on flavor and allergen info.
--------------------
Very good ice cream,taste great,and I will buy more. Last time I bought the little cups of Breyers Vanilla,this time I bought a pint. Thanks Breyers,good job.
--------------------
The. Best. Vanilla. Ice. Cream. Ever!!! I love it. Real vanilla beans are used and you can taste the difference
--------------------
I‚Äôm not a fan of Breyer‚Äôs at all. Every time I shop for ice cream, I always choose other brands because I simply do not enjoy any of Breyer‚Äôs ice cream flavors and the ingredients have changed so it‚Äôs more of a frozen dairy dessert and not actual ice cream. I don‚Äôt like the taste of this at all.
--------------------
This has always been one of my all time favorite brands of ice cream! Their recipe is so simple and so delicious!
--------------------
Breyers Natural Vanilla ice cream is one of the classic ice creams with consistent taste and texture. Light and creamy. Not overly sweet. Perfect alone or on too of some warm apple pie! So good! Its a must have!
--------------------
This is by far the best vanilla icecream there is. They use real vanilla bean in this ice cream and it just makes it so true to the name! Ive always bought this 1 since i was a kid and hated going other places when theyd serve me crap vanilla hahaha
--------------------
Not the best vanilla out there. Texture is not good compared to other brands. Vanilla bean is better with more flavor
--------------------
This is a house staple. I always have a vanilla Brewers in the freezer and occasionally spoon eat it right from the tub.
--------------------
Creamy. Delicious. Smooth. What else can I say. Love to eat a bowl of Breyers vanilla ice cream with potato chips. I really enjoy sweet and the salty taste
--------------------
it is so good! not too hard but not too soft either! very creamy and sweet tasting! i would definitely recommend
--------------------
This is my favorite Vanilla ice cream brand. It is super light and creamy. It is great to eat with a piece of warm brownie.
--------------------
I have been enjoying Bryers Ice Cream for decades. It remains an excellent product obviously Made with care and culinary skill. Additionally, as a young Boy Scout I camped with other scouts on the Bryers’ Estate outside of Philadelphia. Enjoying Bryers’ ice cream is a treat.
--------------------
I love its taste and it helps me to eliminate the craving of eating sweet things also for digestion and it is very good for health, adding a little cookie would give it a better flavor. Delicious
--------------------
You can never go wrong with Breyers Natural Vanilla ice cream! The rich vanilla flavor is a classic and goes well with anything. Sometimes I even have to stop myself from eating the whole tub.
--------------------
It‚Äôs a great vanilla ice cream. The consistency is great for scooping into a cone and it tastes great. It‚Äôs a very smooth and creamy vanilla ice cream. I would recommend this ice cream to you. It really is great.
--------------------
My kids love this-it is a mild vanilla that makes a great root beer float, throw in the blender with strawberries and milk for a shake, or eat it plain. It is affordable (look for sales) and a great staple / treat.
--------------------
ice cream just makes everything better in every situation. enjoy it but try not to eat the entire tub.
--------------------
I like the flavor of the natural vanilla the best. The texture is not as creamy as others but I buy it solely for the flavor.
--------------------
This is literally the beat store bought vanilla ice cream there is I‚Äôve been eating it for about 20 years no and will not even try another vanilla so fresh
--------------------
My #1 Natural Vanilla flavor ice cream choice. Love the authentic vanilla bean specks. The unique Breyers ice cream texture. Its creamy but also dry (in that it breaks apart as you scoop it). Will always repurchase.
--------------------
Simplicity at its best!!!! You CANNOT go wrong with this classic vanilla ice cream! It‚Äôs just so smooth and creamy and flavorful! This beats all the other vanilla ice cream brands out there!!!
--------------------
Always a great product and vanilla is my sons favorite. You can tell the ingredients used are of good quality.
--------------------
This has been one of my favorite ice creams for decades. If I am making something that needs vanilla ice cream - this is always my first choice. It pairs well with any dessert, makes an awesome hot fudge sundae and is great to just eat right out of the container. It‚Äôs very creamy, has a solid vanilla flavor and has no artificial after taste. I love this product!!!
--------------------
Always have loved this. I have eaten it since I was little. My papa and I would watch movies and eat ice cream on Sundays, usually I didn‚Äôt have ball practice those nights.
--------------------
This is my all-time favorite vanilla ice cream. It is smooth and creamy and has an excellent flavor. It's a bit more expensive than other ice cream brands, but definitely worth it.
--------------------
I like vanilla bean. That‚Äôs the only one I will eat. I just like the flavor of the vanilla bean. It‚Äôs just fine the way it is.Delicious..
--------------------
This is my go to ice cream for root beer floats. It‚Äôs the only vanilla ice cream that doesn‚Äôt make me sick
--------------------
Breyers never disappoints. The flavor is on point. The taste is rich and creamy with fresh milk. Goes great on to of warm apple pie. Always able to find in you local grocery store. Will definitely continue to buy.
--------------------
Love a good vanilla ice cream. Taste great. I made banana pudding the other day and added this on top and it was delicious.
--------------------
This is the most truly vanilla ice cream! Like a creamy vanilla bean.
--------------------
I bought this to top my apple crisp the other day. I figured it was a pretty standard brand and couldn‚Äôt go wrong. Well, disappointed is an understatement. It was really grainy tasting and left a weird film in my mouth. Not sure how you can mess up vanilla ice cream..
--------------------
Briers has always had the beat true vanilla taste . No artificial tasing ice cream.
--------------------
Breyers used to be my favorite ice cream -- especially the natural vanilla. No more. They have made a huge mistake by adding non-natural ingredients. They will have lost a lot of sales -- including mine.
--------------------
If I had to choose one ice cream brand/flavor to have for the rest of my life, Breyer a natural vanilla would be it. It has a creamy light consistency but still tastes rich without being heavy. No fake vanilla taste or syrupy finish.
--------------------
Why oh why would change the ingredients of your original Natural Vanilla which was the only ice cream I would eat. Vegetable gum - really. You have now made something totally unpalatable. It now tastes like it has been pumped up with air, does not freeze well and OMG you've also upped the sugar content. Yuk!!! You have lost a loyal customer. Will never buy Breyers again.....
--------------------
Breyer's natural vanilla ice cream is and has been my daughter and my favorite ice cream for years and we hope the recipe never changes because it is PERFECT! It has the most delicious home made vanilla taste, it's creamy and we love it just as it is with nothing on it. The only other way we enjoy it is when I make shakes out of it for us.
--------------------
Great vanilla ice cream. This is one of my favorite brands. This consistency is great and the flavor never disappoints.
--------------------
Regarding Breyers All Natural Vanilla. Why has the vanilla been replaced in the ingredients list by "natural flavor"? Turkey Hill All Natural Vanilla has no gum. Vanilla is included in the ingredient list. The last three 1.5 qt packages of Breyers had ice crystals.
--------------------
Delicious sweet treat! Flavor is great! Really hits the spot for a great price. I would buy this again. Perfect option to eat by itself or make a sundae with.
--------------------
I love breyers!!! I literally just ate the entire tub... all of the flavors are so delicious and so easy to eat fast ü§™ It may be a tad bit expensive, but it is a huge tub so you get what you pay for. Highly recommend!!!
--------------------
Classic packaging ! Simple ingredient list ! Has been a favorite for years.Perfect for a rootbeer float or sundae!
--------------------
Natural Vanilla is my favorite ice cream. It taste wholesome and always satisfies me. I love the taste and the vanilla beans. Breyers is always the brand I buy and trust. It has never disappointed me.
--------------------
LOVE your Natural Vanilla Ice Cream, but my wife has a corn allergy. You originally used actual sugar in it. Have you changed your product to include corn syrup?
--------------------
Breyers comes closest to homemade ice cream taste and is very satisfying
--------------------
My mom buys it for me an d my family it’s so yummmy I would recommend I put sprinkles on it and it taste so good
--------------------
Actual Vanilla beans are small black specks scraped from the inside of a vanilla pod. Look closely at Breyers Natural Vanilla ice cream. You will not find any black specs. Read the ingredients, again no mention of vanilla bean. I suspect they are using natural vanilla extract among other "vanilla" flavors. Real Vanilla beans bring an intense vanilla flavor. Breyers natural flavor vanilla ice cream has no intense vanilla flavor. It is very flat. It is no longer a quality ice cream. Real vanilla beans are very expensive. Try pricing them at your grocery store. I understand why they are not using them anymore, but their advertising is very deceptive. No longer impressed with Breyers quality.
--------------------
Breyer's Natural Vanilla is perfect. It's perfect by itself, it's perfect on pie or with fruit. It's got a great vanilla taste, the texture is divine and it's so tasty. It's basic but you can certainly dress it up and combine it with things or throw in the blender for a milkshake.
--------------------
This was a really refreshing vanilla flavor . One of the best tasting.Better quality then others. Natural vanilla flavor.
--------------------
Great ice cream. I make milkshakes all the time for my kida and husband and self and this is the best icecream to.use for the job. Affordable and only improvemnet is that when I use to make milkshakes with this is melts down to half its original size so in order to make 4 half shake cups I have to add 2 cups of milk to the shake mixture which is ok would just like a larger option and maybe a sugar free one which there maybe but not in the places i have searched.
--------------------
I used to LOVE Breyers natural vanilla ice cream. But in recent years, it's noticeably deteriorated. I can no longer even see the vanilla beans, though they still depict them in the photo on the packaging. I don't see the point of paying a premium price for what is no longer a premium product.
--------------------
Tastes so good! I mix it in with my shakes and I like that the milk doesn’t upset my stomach
--------------------
This is the best vanilla ice cream on the market! The natural vanilla bean flavor isn’t overpowering and delivers the right amount of sweetness and flavor. I love the consistency of this ice cream and always buy it as part of my regular shopping trip.
--------------------
Next best thing to homemade. We love [product:breyers-natural-vanilla] ice cream! Creamy and just sweet enough with a great vanilla flavor. I like to eat this with cereal instead of a cone!
--------------------
Top quality. Very few ingredients and you can pronounce all the ingredients. Clean tasting. Refreshing.
--------------------
It’s fine. The texture is kinda icy and the flavor is nothing special but it works fine for just cake and ice cream or if you just want a basic vanilla to eat or mix. It’s just regular ice cream but there’s nothing wrong with that.
--------------------
I rarely buy icecream and when trying to decide amongst all the choices these days. I put back several other choices remembering how good the Breyers all natural has always tasted. After eating a bowl it just didn’t taste as good as it used too. Later I read the ingredients and realized it has changed. No longer the 3 natural ingredients we know. Very disappointing. I may as well pick one of the others next time.
--------------------
Great classic vanilla ice cream. Nice smooth I've cream with great vanilla flavor. Tasty on its own or adding toppings. Breyers vanilla is my go to vanilla ice cream, have preferred it to other brands I've tried.
--------------------
I’m a chocoholic, and an ice cream snob, and loath anything that tastes to sweet, as I grew with homemade ice cream every Saturday night, with fresh ingredients. While it is not the ice cream of old, (PA 50+yrs ago), it is the best. I/we could eat it everyday ... in large amounts, if I/we didn’t discipline myself/ourselves (entire family). Unfortunately, chocolate tastes to sweet these days, as I cut sugar intake to 1/2 or 0, just like salt. There is a coffee w dark chocolate pcs in another brand that is another favorite when we are out and about... loved this flavor since junior high (Howard Johnson’s).
--------------------
This is hands-down the best vanilla ice cream in your supermarket case. Real vanilla flavor (not just "sweet milk" like a lot of vanilla ice cream seems to be), great creamy feel in your mouth, and perfect for eating alone or using for a sundae or root beer float.
--------------------
I love breyers brand ice cream. You can grab it for a great price every time you purchase. It is so creamy and delicious! We are a repeat buyer of breyers in my house and love it so much. Only thing I don’t like is about after 1month of opening it starts to taste like the container it comes in...so eat it buy then.
--------------------
This has always been a favorite because of the vanilla beans and all natural flavors. Recently, I tried the No Sugar Added" because of the lower calories, but the taste is lacking because it does not contain the vanilla beans. For vanilla lovers please add the vanilla beans to the no sugar added ice cream.
--------------------
Thanking about boxed ice cream, This is my favorite ice cream brand, the consistency it’s great, it has a great taste, so many flavors. A little pricey if you compare it to others but it’s worth it!
--------------------
I love their products, been eating bryers for 50 years!!
--------------------
We love Breyers Natural Vanilla. It works in smoothies, by itself, the magic shell and fruit toppings. BUT our favorite way is to put it in a mug add Pepsi and stir. It’s like a Pepsi shake and is awesome. It doesn’t taste right with any other vanilla but the Natural. So yum in this heat
--------------------
Really spot on, delicious natural vanilla bean flavor, does not look or taste artificial as many vanilla ice creams do. This is a go-to variety that my family has loved for many years. Great quality, minimal ingredients!
--------------------
The best ice cream out there. All natural 3 ingredient ice cream that will satisfy your sweet tooth and allow you to create just ice cream, sundaes or cones. It’s on the expensive side but definitely worth it
--------------------
My kids love vanilla ice cream. I choose Breyer's over other brands because of the creaminess, flavor and quality.
--------------------
Used to be my favorite mass produced ice cream. Now we have added gum. Hadn’t bought any since I noticed the gumminess. What a disappointment. I’d rather not have ice cream than eat this.
--------------------
I love ice cream. Since I don’t like milk, I eat my ice cream for breakfast...along with cereal and fruit. It’s like desert!
--------------------
Sad to realize you put profits ahead of quality products
--------------------
used to love breyers until they started using ingredients that do not belong in icecream. but at least i noticed they are honest enought to call some of their products "frozen dairy dessert" instead of labeling it as icecream which it could no longer be called. I have switched to turkey hills all natural line. it is everything breyers used to be and wish it still was.
--------------------
I sent a co worker to purchase vanilla ice cream for an office event. The Breyers Natural Vanilla was on the shelf with all the Breyers ice creams. She quickly grabbed 4 containers of the Natural Vanilla. To our surprise when serving this was badically ice milk. It totally ruined the cake it was served with. We all looked at the container to see the front of the container listed cream, sugar and milk. However, the actual ingredients on the side says the ingredient (largest ingredient) was milk! The thin icy cosistency was not what was expected. Breyers needs better packaging to identify what the product is, ice milk.
--------------------
Change your ice cream back to the few simple ingredients.
--------------------
Who doesn’t love ice cream? Very happy with my purchase! The taste is phenomenal and my whole family loves this brand! I do not have any complaints at all! The price is comparable to others on the market but so worth it!!!
--------------------
My kid absolutely cannot handle lactose. So trying to find her lactose free was about a pain because wouldnt you know sherbet also has dairy. When I found this the first time I squealed. It tastes exactly the lactose ones right down to the texture. So really give this a try before spending bank on differt options.
--------------------
This product no longer has specks of vanilla in it. Thus, the photo on the box is misleading. Best aspect is lowest fat content of all major brands. Taste is still OK, but not as good as before. Also, they used to have a natural coffee flavor. The new coffee "frozen dessert" is horrible.
--------------------
Love the brownie bites and caramel.
--------------------
Fair warning: this ice cream has a VERY sweet base. The brownie chunks are very hard and not very brownie-like. But I gave it 4 stars because the creamy texture is some of the best I’ve had in a grocery store brand. If you like really sweet ice cream with hard chunks, this would be for you. I won’t purchase again, but it was nice to try something new.
--------------------
This is one of my favorites! The best part is it’s so scoopable. I have to leave bluebell out for about 10 minutes because it’s so hard! Not this stuff. Sweet, creamy, and any thing chocolate and caramel is my favorite, so this is a win! Wish they had a bigger variety of flavors with this brand because the texture is amazing!
--------------------
My new favorite ice cream. Loved it enough to feel compelled to leave a review. If you love chocolate and caramel, definitely try this!
--------------------
this is my fave icecream, always hits the spot.
--------------------
Love it and can’t beat the price
--------------------
This might be the best grocery store ice cream I've ever had. Stands up against any name brand. I'm not even a big chocolate fan, but the caramel balances perfectly with the fudge and brownie bits. Absolutely delicious.
--------------------
Loved it the first time, so bought it again now. I always have a stock of ice cream at home and this ice cream is one of the few that scored high on taste factor. I love everything with caramel flavor and this one comes with bonus chewy brownie bits and fudge. Definitely will buy again.
--------------------
Tastes like vanilla soft serve with very tasty chunks in it. I would get it again,
--------------------
The ice cream base is super fake-tasting sweet, not creamy or refreshing. I liked the fudge and caramel swirls, but the brownie pieces were awful, tasting like rubbery flour. I avoided eating the chunks. Will not buy this flavor again.
--------------------
I picked this up this weekend and OMG! So freaking amazing. It has that same rich, fudge swirl as Moose Tracks, but the brownie and the salted caramel, push this flavor over the top!!!! I hid it in the freezer so my daughter and husband won't find it. I wish I would have bought 2. I guess I have another reason to go back to Target this week!
--------------------
10/10 WOW! This ice cream is NEXT LEVEL amazing!! Salty Moose Tracks fudge mixed with the caramel and brownies..... I could eat this every single day.
--------------------
Best market pantry ice cream out there! I literally could not get enough and was able finish the bucket in 3 days. It would of been sooner but u know practicing self control LOL anyways as a fan of brownie in my ice cream this satisfys my needs. The chunks are not overpowering the ice cream so there’s a good ratio between both. The best part is the flavor which to me tastes somewhat like salted caramel. Delicious !
--------------------
Tastes like it’s from a local ice cream parlor! Creamy and fresh. Vanilla with swirls of fudge and oh those peanut butter cups!! It’s my favorite flavor of Market Pantry. Tastes better than the more expensive ice creams they sell.
--------------------
My new favorite flavor, the kids loved it.
--------------------
I really enjoy the MP Moose tracks! It has a definite central swirl to the fudge, but that makes sense based on how ice cream is packed now. Just scoop from the inside out (like pie) and you will get a more even distribution of chocolate (there has been plenty in every box we’ve tried). The peanut butter cups are YUMMY!!!
--------------------
Literally could be 5 stars but they are soooo stingy with the actual moose tracks. I filled a whole red solo cup with ice cream and had only one of the little chocolate cups in all that ice cream !
--------------------
so tasty! one of our favorites. creamy and delicious.
--------------------
This is good stuff!  I love ice cream and this one is a winner.  Fudge and peanut butter...how could you go wrong??
--------------------
This is the ice cream dreams are made of. Indulge a little (or a lot, no judging) and you won’t regret it.
--------------------
Love this!!! Moose tracks is one of my favorite flavors of ice cream, and I would say it's probably Market Pantry's best work. If I had to critique it, I would ask for better distribution of the toppings. Very satisfying overall.
--------------------
Made milk shakes with this ice cream :) came out great ! Very yummy taste.
--------------------
I love mint and chocolate, this flavor is terrible
--------------------
Yummy! Just as good as any other brand.
--------------------
I loaded up on this Mint Chocolate Chip and Cookies n Cream from local Target today in Sherman Oaks, CA. The taste of the Mint Chip is delicious and texture is excellent. Color is bright green as expected. The chips are  also very tasty and plentiful. I saw mixed reviews by people who criticize the chips, which I find surprising. Anyone who thinks Mint Chip should have chocolate shavings shouldn’t eat Mint Chip ice cream. The name is Chip not shavings. I would ignore any negative reviews, as they’re likely from competitors. Both flavors I tried are excellent values. Price was regular $2.99, which is fair in July. Other flavors like Java Chip or Moose Tracks are higher, over $4.
--------------------
I wouldn't buy it again. The mint flavor is barely noticeable & the chunks of choc are big & waxy.
--------------------
For whatever reason there were only a couple of choices of Mint Chip at Target yesterday. We have tried a lot of Market Pantry stuff with no issues.
This one was the exception. The first bite you wanted to spit it out. It tasted like you had a mouth full of sand mixed with chalk and fake mint flavoring. The "chocolate" chunks I am not even sure are real. They were like plastic and left a film in your mouth. Totally Disgusting. Not worth the hassle of returning. Down the drain it goes. If I could give it 0 stars or negative stars I would.
--------------------
Yes, the chocolate chips are chunks instead of shavings. I prefer the chunks - you can actually taste the chocolate, and biting into one is like biting into a Hershey dark chocolate bar. This ice cream is also a bit creamier than the brand I used to buy, which took some getting used to, but now I really like it. The only problem is that the Mint Chocolate Chip always seems to be out of stock at my local store.

Side note: Target seems to price its ice cream seasonally. Sometimes, the 1.5 quart package is $2.29, and sometimes it is $3.29. At $2.29 it's a steal, and at $3.29 it's still a good enough deal.
--------------------
Yummm! A lot of people say they would rather have the shavings but I think that it’s better with the chunks.
--------------------
Delicious, creamy, and minty. The chocolate chunks are great too, they don't pull out my dentures.
--------------------
It has choccolate chunks, and mint flvor, and it's ice cream, but it's the worst Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream I've ever had. It's the consistency of frozen soft serve with very weak mint flavoring. Very dissappointing.
--------------------
Sad that the new formula is thick hard chunks. Market Pantry go back to the chocolate shavings. This was the only mint chip ice cream I would buy, now I will stick with Baskin Robbins.
--------------------
Used to be similar if not better than basken & robbins. Why change perfection.
--------------------
The recipe before was perfect!! Better than any other mint chocolate chip ice cream anywhere. Bring back the melt in your mouth chocolate chips please.
--------------------
This was my favorite ice cream until this week- the chocolate is now big chunks and not the smooth shavings it was before. I am bummed that my favorite ice cream is no more.
--------------------
Totally addicting! The best part is the last bite...keeps you wanting more. They should make a cereal consisting of just that last bite!
--------------------
I loveee these! we always make sure we have some
--------------------
One word: delicious!
--------------------
It is yummy crunchy goodness. I love every yummy bite.
--------------------
I am a borderline diabetic and I still was able to indulge in your chocolate vanilla almond bar. 3 things have changed with the last packages that I bought. The chocolate is way too sweet (more sugar must have been added), the almonds have no almond flavor, and the ice cream is not creamy. You have switched to skim milk, so I read on the label. I always by 4 packages at a time. I will look for different ice cream products in the future.
--------------------
The internal confection, to call it ice cream would be improper, lacks smooth richness. The texture was consistent throughout the bar so it was an undamaged product. It had an almost crystalline texture. The vanilla flavor very subdued. Since the legal definition of "Ice cream" has become more lax, there is more milk and less cream being used in many "ice cream" products and the mouth feel is diminished. Look for a premium bar if you remember the days of smooth, flavorful ice cream.
--------------------
I always have Haagan Daz ice cream or bars in my freezer and last night I opened a new box and like the other comments I've read here, the quality was much different than usual. The chocolate was thin and fell apart easily, it was similar to Nestlé and not the higher quality I'm used to from Haggan Daz. The ice cream was icy and not creamy and the size was much smaller than usual. I was very disappointed
--------------------
I bought a rather expensive 3 pack of these bars and couldn’t believe how tiny it was when I pulled it out of the package. Since the chocolate coating is always so decadent, I thought that would make up for the smaller size. Too bad the chocolate is now low quality, the ice cream is not creamy and rather tasteless and the nuts are unremarkable. I am not sure how you can tell all these people there have been no changes to these bars. We can’t all be wrong.
--------------------
I love ice cream and look for quality when I eat it. These ice cream bars taste cheap. The texture is awful,one thing I hate is ice cream that is icy because it usually has no taste. They need to do better!
--------------------
I have been buying these for years, now the bar is the size of a credit card. Where's the value. I will find a substitute or just visit local icecream shops
--------------------
Rich chocolate and fresh almonds make theirs the best. I'm buying 3 boxes per week to support my habit! Caution, can be very addictive! Lol!!! If u could just buy the chocolate almond coating, I'd prob. eat it by itself! I'm no vanilla fan, but the chocolate coating and vanilla ice cream compliment each other perfectly. The Ice cream is not super sweet making the perfect combo! Even my cat likes a lick or two. =)
--------------------
I used to love these but as some other recent reviews mentioned, they must have changed the recipe. The chocolate on the outside is still good, but this is in no way like the Haagen Dazs ice cream in the pints. The ice cream in the bars now has a very thin ice milk consistency, not rich and creamy. I thought this was a fluke but it happened the second time I bought them as well. I hope it was just a bad batch and not a permanent change to the product.
--------------------
I used to eat these all the time as a treat with my parents when I was younger. After I got out of the military and haven’t had them in a couple years, I finally convinced my husband to buy them as a treat for us. The first bar was like ice milk instead of the delicious, creamy vanilla ice cream I know it was like. The chocolate was thinner with less almonds, and I know this changed because younger me would always carefully take off the chocolate first then enjoy the ice cream, even after eating it there is a gross filmy texture in my mouth, like the same feelings after eating a super artificially made ice cream, it didn’t hit the spot at all like it used to. I thought maybe it is because it is too cold or whatever, then ate another the next day and got the same unpleasant results. That’s when I knew I wasn’t going crazy and googled this page, and alas, I am not the only one who noticed this. My husband has never had them before and will eat anything so he can have the rest of the box, but until the reviews say they are back to how they used to be, I would rather not buy anything from you guys, cause as much as I enjoy the small carry sized ice cream, I can’t reason myself to indulge in it. If you guys haven’t changed anything but it isn’t the same, why not change and look into what you guys can do to make it the original?
--------------------
hello,please give me my money worth,before we can get started ice cream gone,sorry no photo to show,ice cream bars was so small,hello,have you heard the slogan,where the beef/where the ice cream ,YES I WOULD RECOMMEND FRIEND S,,FAMILY MEMBERS OTHERS,ONLY IF YOU MAKE UP ICE CREAM SHORTAGE I RECEIVED WHEN I BROUGHT BARS IN WESTERN BEEF
--------------------
I love these bars so much that I get very disappointed because they are always sold out at my local store. Is it possible to buy by the case? I want it for wedding favors so 3 to a pack won’t do. HELP!!!
--------------------
I bought a box a few days ago and to my surprise it was a new and improved version! The ice cream was not creamy, in fact, it was very icy and and left a greasy film on top of my mouth. The chocolate was too soft and when I took a bite it all fell apart! The taste is not at all the same. Help! We need the old recipe back!
--------------------
I googled "Costco Häagen-Dazs bars low quality" and found this page. Yeah, the ice cream has no taste and the chocolate is super thin.
--------------------
Me and my family love getting these as a treat. We love them every time. So yummy
--------------------
I know they are saying nothing has changed. But it clearly has. The bar is smaller, the ice cream isn’t as creamy and the coating isn’t as thick. I know this because part of why I didn’t eat the bar regularly was because of the calorie content. And now that has gone from like 360 to 270.
--------------------
I am eating a bar with almond on it as we speak. I haven't been eating Haagen Dazs for a long time but they taste good. I can't taste the almond taste that good and the chocolate do fall off but the ice cream taste great
--------------------
Delicious, my fave, but vanilla could be richer- is this the same as the original vanilla?
--------------------
Amazing flavor and overall really tasty. I love it!!
--------------------
while still tasty the almond/chocolate covered vanilla bars smaller than my last boxes and also this anniversary box didnt have the same quality taste as my old box.our family has always been a haagen das only family. will be checking elsewhere
--------------------
Why can't I find then anymore? Only ice milk which sucks.
--------------------
Just purchased 2 boxes and wife and kids complained that they are now half the size, and don't have as much almonds and taste like ice milk. No more HG unless they improve and get the size back. What a rip -off!!!
--------------------
It tastes like a knock-off, like soft-serve. Haagen Daz is not SOFT SERVE! The ice cream is not dense, I used to enjoy the thick dense haagen daz vanilla ice cream with almonds bar, it took many licks to get it down. Now it's like soft serve. I don't know why they changed the best ice cream bar in the world. I feel bad for todays' kids. I need to find another brand that can provide the dense haggen daz ice cream of the past. Thanks for the memories, wish you guys would bring back the original recipe from years ago.
--------------------
These ice cream bars are not the same as they used to be. In fact, nowhere near what they used to be. If Haagen-Dazs first came out with this current version years and years ago, they never would have gotten off to a good start and would not ha e been popular. I will never buy these again. They're too small, too thin now, and not nearly as indulgent as they used to be. The ice cream didn't even seem as thick and creamy as it used to be. Did another company by them out? There ice cream bars are now just generic ice cream bars. I'm going for Dove bars from now on.
--------------------
I used to love these ice cream bars but over the past few months I've noticed it's not even like I've cream anymore, it's like frozen, hard milk. Won't be purchasing these ever again.
--------------------
I bought a box of the almond/chocolat coated bars. I was excited because Haagen Dazs has always been the fancy brand that's a treat. I ate the coating, no problem tasted great. But the ice cream inside was weird and powdery feeling. And didn't taste like much. Very disappointing with how expensive the three packs can be. I purchased two boxes, I'm afraid the other one will be this way.
--------------------
I used to love Haagen Daz ice cream and bars but not anymore. They are now half the size and half the flavor. You can definitely tell that they are using cheap ingredients. The bar hardly has any almonds on it. Not wasting my calories on them anymore. Looking for a new ice cream treat.
--------------------
So good it's a crime not to have this vanilla milk flavor in a pint. Please start producing these in pints!
--------------------
I love it It is very hard to find sometimes My cat love a little lick.
--------------------
I LOVE these ice cream bars. I wish I could find them in a larger quantity. I can eat these every day.
--------------------
I've been eating Haagen Dazs for more than 40 years. I rarely eat any other ice cream; my favorite is the milk chocolate with vanilla ice cream bar. I know for sure that the size of the bars is about half the size they were a few years ago. I joke with my husband about how, if the size continues to decrease, I'll be taking Haagan Daz pills in a couple of years. It's not really funny because, at the same time, the price has doubled and the ice cream does taste more like ice milk, at times. The jars don't seem to have changed much. What happened to the bars? We know something changed, the size, for sure, so don't gaslight us, please.
--------------------
Hello! I have always enjoyed the high quality of Haagen Dazs' Ice Cream and Ice Cream Bars. The ice cream has always been so incredibly creamy and delicious. So, when I bought a box of the Vanilla Milk Chocolate Almond Ice Cream Bars, I expected that same high quality. But when I took a bite of the ice cream bar, I immediately noticed a difference. The ice cream tasted like ice milk. As I looked at the ingredients, I noticed soy was listed. I don't believe this ingredient was in the original list. Because soy tends to change the chemistry of a recipe when mixed with cream, this might be the reason for the change in the taste.I sincerely hope you consider going back to the original recipe.
--------------------
I don't know what half size bars that people are talking about but these taste same as they have tasted always. Also Haagen dazs bars been 3oz and still is. Maybe they picked up the dieters' version which are just one bite. Really. Now, if you want smooth creamy version of these bars, don't get the one with almonds, just get the plain milk chocolate cover. The crunchy almonds seemed to lessen the creaminess of the ice cream inside.
--------------------
I do not like when something is too sweet. I believe they have very good flavor, the ice cream does not melt right away, the almonds were toasted and delicious. I believe is a great product.
--------------------
i don’t know what you guys are complaining about, but it tastes perfectly fine too me. perfect on a summer day
--------------------
I have been eating these since I was a child and was sadly surprised about the decline in size and quality of the product. The ice cream bar itself has become significantly smaller although the price has not! The next noticeable difference was the decrease in the amount of almonds embedded in the chocolate. Previously no small bite was without almonds but now the nuts are sparsely place in the chocolate shell. Next the chocolate shell is much thinner than before. Lastly vanilla ice cream doesn’t taste like the high quality Haagen Daz I’ve always love. I don’t purchase ice cream often and when I do it’s normally exclusively Haagen Daz but with the decrease in quality and the same price, I may have to rethink purchasing their products.
--------------------
I purchased three (3) boxes which includes three (3) bars and I ate all of them in three (3) days. Will buy again tomorrow.
--------------------
I have fond childhood memories with my mom and dad getting these every Friday in the Summer as an indulgent treat for us to enjoy. I decided to grab a box as it has been at least 25-30 yrs since I had one and wow!!! Not at all what they used to be, so sad! Half the size, ice cream tastes watery like a good humor bar and the coating is barely there. Very disappointing, this is not a product that needed any changes at all...it used to be perfect and now it's just trash.
--------------------
It really is the best ice cream bar .. it's just sad to see the original size replaced by a tiny kids size bar
--------------------
Smaller sizes I have to eat 3 to get same effect as 1 used to be. As people stated quality went down too. Not sure if its true or not but feels like it. Sad. This is an outrage!
--------------------
I bought a box of the this a week ago and there was no issue with the overall taste. Then just a few days ago I bought another box this time around the box was different (I guess it was the birthday addition because that’s what was stated on the box. Anyway the taste of the ice cream was horrible it just tasted like frozen milk, nothing at all like the one I had from the first box, and the outer part was not only thinner but tasted cheap almost like a generic nestle bar which is disgusting and there was way less almonds. I was very disappointed because the cost wasn’t cheap at my local super market. Don’t think I’ll be purchasing again if this is the new taste of them :(
--------------------
Deez things are de BEST!!! They are really good and the ice cream is well, creamy!
--------------------
This isn't the Haagen-Daazs I used to remember. Their ice cream used to be quality, and I would always buy their brand even though it costs more because the quality is worth it. I bought a box of their bars a half an hour ago, and it's really small, the ice cream doesn't taste rich, the texture is not smooth, but icy, and the chocolate is chipping off onto my lap or the floor. I might have to find a different quality brand for my ice cream. So disappointing.
--------------------
Average based on previous quality. Much smaller and chocolate is a lot thinner.
--------------------
it is delicious as any other ice cream.i love it no doubts about it
--------------------
I've been buying these through the quarantine. They bring me moments of joy now and then and they're delicious. The chocolate tastes premium which is why I like to get these over the store brand crunch bars. The thing is, the Haagen Dazs ice cream could be creamier and maybe a little less processed tasting. My store brand has a great creamy, milky ice cream inside but the chocolate is thin and subpar. These bars so far have been exactly as picture on the site as of May 2020 and for me the size is fine. They would get 5 stars for a better ice cream and thicker chocolate, but I will still be buying these anyway because I love that chocolate.
--------------------
Was so excited when I saw the brand in my local store . Unexpected surprise when I bit into it . The taste was ok but the bar is extremely small. For the money I was expecting more . I will try your competitor next time .
--------------------
I’m diabetic, so the size is perfect, I enjoyed it from the first bite to the end!! The best of all not too many carbs.. loved it!!
--------------------
It was surprising to find all these comments saying negative things, I am sory for your bad experiences, but for me these bars are fantastic
--------------------
I cannot believe Haagen-Dazs could produce such a product. It is just as the other reviews say, the chocolate coating is thin, and the ice cream is like frozen ice, not creamy at all!! I would say the Dove bars are 100000 times better.
--------------------
I love these ice cream bars. I enjoy the ice cream, chocolate and most of all the crunch of the almonds. They are hard to find and when I do I have to get three boxes.
--------------------
I buy these for my husband as he LOVES them.. we should probably own stock in them by now.. however I have to look for something similar now as these have shrunken in size recently and are not any cheaper. He can eat two now and that’s just costly. Hoping to find something that is just as good.
--------------------
Haagen Dazs is true to ice cream. Short list of ingredients and an abundance of flavor. These almond ice cream bars are heaven and have been my pregnancy go-to treat. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the last couple times I bought these bars, they were extremely small. They were in the same box as the regular size ones and there was no specification that these would be smaller or vary in size. I'm disappointed because I always appreciated the consistency of the product. Hopefully this gets better!
--------------------
The size is smaller that a credit card... I am very disappointed.
--------------------
I would give it a 0. I am very disappointed in the change in the icecream
--------------------
I was a fan of your chocolate almond coated ice cream bars, but they’ve been significantly downsized, and the chocolate coating is not thick and Indulgent and nutty like before. It’s thin, sparsely dotted with nut chips and the ice cream isn’t as creamy. Same price, just less of a product. Guess I’ll have to try Dove bars or Magnum for my ice cream joneses.
--------------------
these are a sweet treat! Makes for a tasty dessert I love the almonds, chocolate & taste of the ice cream.
--------------------
Love these bars, but in reading the nutritional info., it states that the serving size is 2, for an individually wrapped ice cream bar. So, for this tiny pop, one is supposed to eat half of it and then re-wrap it and refreeze? Let?s be honest, everything should be doubled - it is really almost 600 calories a bar. I hate misleading labeling.
--------------------
I don't know what these people are talking about..these bars are, as always, absolute perfection!
--------------------
I tasted 1 ice cream bar and it was so bland it did not even taste like a haagendazs brand. This was nothing like it used to be. I can not believe how plain it tastes like. It does not even taste like ice cream! I am so disappointed in this brand. Please change the taste. I really should have read the reviews on this item before wasting my money like everyone else.
--------------------
These past 2 times my ice cream bars have had little to no almonds in the chocolate if I wanted chocolate bars I would have gotten the regular bars
--------------------
I bought these last night and they are so good! They are light and have quality ice cream. Perfecto!
--------------------
Used to be better, barely freeze at 10 degrees, and I have checked the temperature with a professional digital thermometer. Everything else in my freezer is rock hard, but when you bite into a chocolate covered vanilla bar, it collapses and makes a mess. Some kind of ingredient was added in the past two or three years to make the ice cream creamy. Dove and Kirkland bars are rock solid. NOTE HOW TWO OF THE SURVEY QUESTIONS ASK ABOUT INCREASING CREAMY TEXTURE BUT NOT ABOUT DOING THE OPPOSITE. Too bad!
--------------------
I haven't had these in a long time and I was looking forward to a decadent dessert. Boy was I disappointed it tasted like ice milk with ice crystals in it. Is this a new formula?
--------------------
Please restore the original flavor and texture of these ice cream bars. I pay too much money from BJs to be so disappointed! The Chocolate layer crumbles At first bite, and the flavor has disappeared. These bars were delicacies, now they just taste cheap.
--------------------
For years, Haagen Daz had THE best ice cream and the VSA bars were everything, with the thick Belgian chocolate coating full of roasted almond pieces encasing the best vanilla ice cream available. I guess everything must come to an end. It's a real shame. And the fact that consumers are still being charged premium prices for subpar product ads insult to injury. In fact, I would much prefer a run of the mill version over what has become of the HD brand. The chocolate coating is awful, the nuts less plentiful and all the rich specialness of the vanilla ice cream is gone. Blue Bunny is MUCH better. I don't know if HD is farming production out to new Mars or if they just wholesale changed the recipe but until I hear from consumers that they have returned to their origin as l taste and quality, I am DONE.
--------------------
I used to love Haagen-Dazs and it was hands down my favorite brand but, despite the denials, it definitely has changed to a sub par ice cream bar. The size is smaller, the coating thinner, and the ice cream lost it's amazing richness and is replaced by a watered down ice cream with barely a hint of vanilla.
--------------------
Why is it so small? What happened to the OG size? What happened to the taste? Is the wooden stick even wood anymore? Is the ice cream the same? What on earth is going on. I'm sad and disappointed. Haagan Das if you haven't noticed people really like good quality and are willing to pay for it. But it makes us feel we can't trust you when we spend a nice penny for the tiniest ice cream bar ever.
--------------------
These bars are an embarrassment to the Haagen Daz brand. Their regular ice cream on the other hand continues to be very good.
--------------------
I just bought 2 boxes of the almond bar. The bars are substantially smaller now. I felt like I got scammed. I would have made paid more for the original size bar. I won't buy anymore of your products.
--------------------
The vanilla ice cream is much less creamier than it used to be, and you all have confirmed you changed it. The chocolate is also of lower quality than it used to be. It breaks off in pieces, like a cheap ice cream truck bar, nothing like it used to be.
--------------------
I am not a huge ice cream fan but bought these today on a whim. Perfection. Every bite/lick better than the last. I will definitely buy these again! And I will encourage others to buy it!
--------------------
If i wanted to i could eat the whole box, they're that good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
ive bought these multiple times but something is off. the ice cream had a icy, sandy texture and was not at all creamy.
--------------------
We've been buying your ice cream bars for a long time, but decided this would be our last box. Our issue isn't the chocolate or the almonds; it's the ice cream. Instead of the rich, creamy decadent ice cream that used to be inside the bars, it tastes like you use ice milk (not real ice cream). You need to return to the formula that made your ice cream bars so popular; otherwise, your company will not survive.
--------------------
These pops taste great. Been eating them since i was a kid and i still love them.
--------------------
Häagen-Dazs is the #1 ice cream bar in the United States. Häagen-Dazs makes the best ice cream bars in America. Fact Häagen-Dazs perfected their ice cream bars and no one comes close. The Belgian chocolate and vanilla ice cream just melts together perfectly on the tongue. No one can beat it. Personally, I would like to see more dark chocolate and vanilla ice cream bars available in stores.
--------------------
Why is the bar so much smaller and same price!? I’ve been buying for years and all of a sudden it changed with no warning.
--------------------
We loved the ice cream bars and were willing to live with the price in the past, but now that they are about 1/2 the size but still the same price, we've moved on to other brands.
--------------------
Love these! I do know they make them in the mini size as well. They are delicious! I keep these in my freezer all the time. You can never go wrong with Haagen dazs
--------------------
I know nothing stays the same forever but I recently purchased these bars. Some of my favorite for the last 20 years probably. I pull it out and it’s way smaller. Then it didn’t taste horrible but was definitely not the same or as good. Please return these to how they were before I definitely would not re purchase these.
--------------------
This ice cream bar used to be a great treat. But not only has it shrunk in size with the thick coating of milk chocolate on the outside is no longer a thick coating. For the price I pay I want what I was getting. A nice ice cream bar with a thick coating of milk chocolate and covered in nuts. What is this rinky-dink thing you guys are offering now. A thin shell of chocolate with a few spare almond crust here in there. What a joke. Definitely not worth the price point.
--------------------
Best ice cream ever. Literally I just ate one of your ice cream bar and I was like I’m gonna write a good review because I actually really enjoyed the ice cream it was perfect !!!!!so good job!!!! and this ice cream made my night delicious
--------------------
This is so disappointing. Haagen-dazs was my absolute favorite ice cream and I would purchase these bars every single week. This product has been changed terribly. The size of the bar is almost half the size it used to be. I bought the REGULAR size bars and it's a joke. The ice cream is not anything like it used to be, it tastes artificial and it is not creamy. The chocolate coating is now generic and bland. This product is not worth the price anymore. I won't be buying Haagan-dazs products ever again unless these changes are reversed.
--------------------
Just bought a box from Sobeys and the chocolate shell was fine but the inside ice cream was a gritty texture. I thought maybe it was a fluke and just the one but I had my boyfriend open another one and try it and the texture was the same. This was weird since we bought a box last week and no problem with that one.
--------------------
Sadly, the quality of the chocolate almond bar is not as good as the orginal larger size bar. Please look into bringing back a better product. Very disappointed in Haagen Dazs.
--------------------
I bought these because in the past we have loved Haagen Dazs. When my husband and I tried them tonight, we both thought they tasted weird. The chocolate was good but the ice cream tasted like frozen milk. We couldn’t even finish the bars.
--------------------
This has a very ice milk taste, not creamy like the low budget brands. Might as well buy the cheaper low budget brands.
--------------------
Haagen Daz used to be my favorite ice cream but does not taste the same. I agree with most of the other reviewers that the size of these bars is smaller than before and I thought it was just me thinking that. The ice cream also has a different taste. Please go back to the original recipe and size.
--------------------
Omg.. I soooooo love this ice cream bar.. it's my all time favorite sooo freaking good cant get enough
--------------------
Bring back the old version. The new version just isn’t as good, quality and quantity wise. The bar is smaller (its almost mini size), there aren’t as many almonds, and the ice cream doesn’t taste as creamy. I think I’m going to have to find a new favorite.
--------------------
The vanilla ice cream tasted watery and had a gritty texture similar to low quality ice milk products. In the past the bars that I purchased tasted top quality with a delicious dense but rich creamy flavorful taste and texture. I will not be buying the Haagen-dazs ice cream bars again as it is a waste of my money. I just hope that the pint of strawberry ice cream that I bought at the same time still has the great high quality taste and texture it had the previous time I bought some about 2 months ago.
--------------------
My favorite ice cream bars have less chocolate fewer nuts & are smaller. Does the size vary if purchased at different locations? Totally disappointed.
--------------------
What have you done to the vanilla milk chocolate almond bars? Smaller, less chocolate and almonds, and less creamy ice cream. This used to be my favorite bar. Will be looking to switch brands. So disappointed.
--------------------
There is something different about the size, coating, and shape of the bars. It is not the same - lessor quality.
--------------------
I really loved these bars but recently the quality of the ice cream has gone down. The chocolate exterior is still delicious but the ice cream interior is for lack of a better term gritty. It’s bumpy and almost sandy. Not smooth and creamy like it used to be. I thought I got a bad box and purchased two more boxes on different occasions. Each time I’ve had the same issue. Very disappointing and sad.
--------------------
The vanilla ice cream inside was gritty, powdery, not creamy or smoothly at all, also tasted very water down.
--------------------
The almonds and milk chocolate is really good and the flavor
--------------------
I wasn't sure if it was just me or if I just had a bad batch, but after looking at the other reviews, I do not seem to be the only one who has noticed a change in the product. Haagen-Dazs bars have always been a bit of a special treat. If I am going to use my calories on ice cream, I would rather splurge on something decadent than eat something of lower quality. In the past Haagen-Dazs bars were rich and creamy, with a nice thick chocolate coating. The bars are now smaller, the chocolate coating is thin and the ice cream is not as creamy. Its still ice cream, so it doesn't taste horrible, but it is no longer special. I'm not sure if Haagen-dazs was bought out by another company or not, but making changes like this to the product is cheapening their name. I understand that the ice cream market has changed, there are so many more brands and options for a luxury brands, but there is not the way to compete. Please maintain your high standards.
--------------------
So i have bought the Kirkland bars and these, they are surprisingly small, and there were 15. The ice cream from Kirkland was bigger, and there were 18 bars in those. So I think this was a waste of money
--------------------
I like chocolate ice cream, but it’s not my favorite. This ice-cream is basically just chocolate, double chocolate cookies, and cookie dough—the caramel ice cream is basically nonexistent. I think it’s the chocolate overpowering it. If you enjoy chocolate, you’d probably love this. I wish there were more chocolate chip cookie dough pieces, and I prefer them to the peanut butter ones. I love the double chocolate cookie pieces as well.
--------------------
Seriously the best ice cream out there. Amazing! Goes so fast in this house, but it’s good it’s in a small container so I don’t over eat.
--------------------
THIS ICE CREAM IS AMAZING. Seriously the best flavor.
--------------------
It is not an exaggeration when I say that this sublime concoction has helped me survive the dumpster fire that has been 2020. The blend of smooth, decadent chocolate and caramel ice creams and cookie dough chunks perfection...but then you add in the magical cookie ribbon (my favorite part) and this ice cream is everything. Random spoonfuls and/or a full pint here and there have been part of my self-care routine and honestly helped me make it through various stay at home orders, press conferences, and this never ending election cycle. Thank you Ben and Jerry!
--------------------
Best ice cream ever!
--------------------
I went to buy my usual flavor and saw this one. I read the description and decided to give it a shot. Holy crap. This flavor was amazing. It's like everything right about ice cream in one little pint. It's just the perfect blend of flavors. B&J's needs to make this a permanent addition to their line up and never get rid of it.
--------------------
I eat about 1 carton a week, this is the best ice cream out there. It is unbelievably delicious, nothing to complain about.
--------------------
Really not much to say. This is hands down one of the yummiest flavors!
--------------------
i like to live my life to the fullest, and the tonight dough is the ice cream i like to do it with. i'm always asking for more in life and am let down... when i asked the tonight dough for more it delivered. chocolate? check. caramel? check. peanut butter? check. cookie dough? check. what more could you ask for? it's exceptionally sweet in the best way possible. this flavor isn't for the slightly dedicated. when you choose the tonight dough, you go all in.
--------------------
This is hands-down my most favorite ice cream ever! I have been eating probably 2 pints a week for several years now, and no I don’t weigh 400 pounds! All jokes aside, this ice cream is absolutely delicious. Between the soft dough and the slightly gritty cookie swirl part, it’s just perfect!
--------------------
This flavour is hands down my most favourite ice cream! Any time I have enough money, I always try to grab a pint or two because its just so dang delicious. I can't remember what turned me onto Tonight Dough, but it's been my soulmate for nearly 2 years now. If I can't find my baby, I usually settle for Half Baked, but The Tonight Dough will always be at the top of the totem pole for me. ♡♡♡♡♡
--------------------
The absolute must have stressed eating snack, post breakup treat, or celebratory guilty pleasure. Worth every carb and calorie.
--------------------
This one really might be the best flavor ever. There are SO many chunk pieces and the cookie doughs are the best tasting cookie dough bits compared to any other brand. The caramel and chocolate ice cream is a good pair, and the texture of the cookie swirls are AMAZING. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have bought this twice, there's so, much cookie dough and the caramel and peanut butter is so good~!!!!!!!! would recommend
--------------------
(see the review title) but still super good. I would like a pint signed by Jimmy Fallon.
--------------------
I think we buy out our grocery store every few weeks if this flavor.. it is AMAZING.
--------------------
Words cannot describe how delicious this flavor is. The cookie swirl along with the never ending chunks of cookie dough is absolutely amazing!
--------------------
DELICIOUS omgggg I love this
--------------------
I love the flavors of the cookie dough and the combination of the ice cream are a perfect match. I used to like Half Baked, but I'm not a fan of chocolate chips. I love this ice cream.
--------------------
I love this ice cream! I eat it when I am sad and it makes my day!! It is definitely the best ice cream. Is a PERFECT! Definitely try! So worth it!!!!!!
--------------------
This ice cream is absolutely delicious and satisfies all of the cravings! This is a level up from traditional cookie dough.
--------------------
So yummy. Love the mix of different doughs. Its like cookie dough plus brownies.
--------------------
Tried this ice cream for the first time a few days ago and it didnt disappoint. I loved the peanut butter and cookie dough mix. The caramel and chocolate ice cream didnt give it an overwhelming sweetness to it. Must try ice cream!
--------------------
My favorite Ben and Jerrys go to ice cream if Im watching a movie or just need to have a moment. The chunky chocolatey ice cream is what I seek in all of the ice creams I buy and this one is perfect. I like the pb cookies too its a different flavor in the mix.
--------------------
I love some cookie dough and this blend is amazing. Ben & Jerrys may be my favorite brand I just wish they had bigger tubs.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite ice creams! Its delicious!!! Its one the pricier side for an ice cream carton, but I think its worth it. Yum!
--------------------
I have had sooooooo many flavors of Ben & Jerry's throughout my life. It is an amazing brand. There's always so many goodies jam packed into one container! And there's an insane amount of choices available. This one is pretty memorable due to Jimmy Fallon's face being on the container.
--------------------
My fave flavor! It is amazing with such variety. I love this stuff. I could eat a whole pint. All of their flavors are great though.
--------------------
One of my most favorite ice creams! Has a little bit of everything and definitely satisfies all your sweet cravings. Perfect for that time of the month. A little pricey but definitely worth the buy
--------------------
When Im having a cheat day or half day, this is my goto. It is everything you could want in an ice cream and more! Salty, sweet, crunchy, soft. It has it all
--------------------
this is by far my boyfriends favorite ice cream. ive tried it before and its great. theres a lot of different textures and theyre all very good.
--------------------
Ben and Jerrys is my absolute go to ice cream. In my opinion it is worth the price tag on it. I really really wish they made bigger sizes though. All flavors are amazing I would definitely recommend there ice cream to everyone.
--------------------
I mean who doesnt love cookie dough? Love the chocolate chip cookie dough in this ice cream.
--------------------
One of my favorite ice cream flavors ever. Usually my go to Ben and Jerrys. I love anything with cookie dough and this one is delicious. So good I usually eat the whole thing in one sitting. Definitely recommend!!
--------------------
This was totally my go to ice cream when I was pregnant! I craved it every night! So delicious! I would just make it in bigger containers
--------------------
10/10 would recommend this to everyone! The amount of toppings mixed in with actual ice cream is great. This is the perfect ice cream.
--------------------
Its nice, but the flavor its kinda soft tbh, Im a repeat consumer of ben and berry. But its not my favorite flavor
--------------------
The Tonight Dough from Ben and Jerrys is super sweet and 100% for cookie dough lovers! It is a little bit too rich for my liking but its still freaking delicious! They price isnt terrible depending where you get it either.
--------------------
Super yummy and love Jimmy Fallon, Im just not a huge peanut butter person so it definitely threw me off when trying this. Still super delicious and I would eat it if I was in the mood for it, love the cookie dough and brownies as well!
--------------------
I love this product, it is one of my favorites. This product takes the best out of other products and combines them. I would not change anything about this product. I would recommend this to everyone.
--------------------
The tonight dough is my favorite ice cream to pick up at the store because it is delicious and always fills my sweet craving
--------------------
My go to ice cream when I want to mix it up from vanilla. Its not too much chocolate. Just enough and has the crunchy chips and perfect bite sizes of cookie dough too. Pint size is perfect! Love this ice cream!
--------------------
By far my favorite flavor ice cream. However, I could do without the peanut butter flavor. Nonetheless this packaging and concept is literally everything and I tell everyone to get this anytime they have an opportunity.
--------------------
You can't go wrong with Ben and Jerrys ice cream and this flavor is among the best flavors they have my only criticism is that I will they would make this one in their vegan line
--------------------
You can never go wrong with Ben&Jerrys!!! Its pricey but worth every penny. Stores often have sales so it isnt too bad. Its delicious and very easy to eat the whole thing!!
--------------------
Really loved all the different flavors and add-ins for this ice cream. Complemented one another really well.
--------------------
My fav Ben and Jerrys flavor. Im not a huge ice cream fan but i do love this flavor. It is really sweet so Im only able to have like 4 bites at a time which is really random but hey i did say Im not a huge ice cream fan.
--------------------
This is my favorite Ben and Jerrys flavor. Its just so good. The cookie dough chunks are the best. The only issue with it is trying to not eat the entire pint in one sitting.
--------------------
This is the best store bought ice cream Ive ever had! It has so much deliciousness packed into this small pint. Seriously, try this stuff!!
--------------------
This is one of my favorite Ben and Jerry ice creams. I buy it all of the time. I like both of the cookie doughs.
--------------------
Amazing ice cream has everything you need in it, best in the store not in grocery store
--------------------
i have had this product multiple times and it is always so tasty, however after eating it a lot it can get kind of sickening. also due to cookie dough in it, it can be hard to scoop. but the texture is amazing and i love the flavor of the cookie dough.
--------------------
This has quickly become a favorite in our household. The different flavors and textures work together nicely and we have to make ourselves put it away before we eat it all in one sitting! Must try!
--------------------
This is hands down one of my favorite ice creams. It is so decadent and delicious. It is a bit pricey, but it's sooo good. I will buy this again and again. It will satisfy your sweet tooth for sure.
--------------------
This flavor is my favorite by far. It has so many delicious components that work perfectly together. Amazing.
--------------------
You cant loose with this jam packed full of all the goodies that you can put in an ice cream. Its definitely a perfect overload.
--------------------
This tastes really good but can be extremely heavy. Theres a lot in there and its a good mix. Cant eat too much of it though.
--------------------
Delicious and great tasting ice cream. Wish this was cheaper to purchase but it is definitely a treat every once in a while :)
--------------------
Cant go wrong With any of these flavors. Perfect amount of cd and brownie in the mix.
--------------------
This I've cream is perfect for people who like a lot of "stuff" in their ice cream. It honestly had a great Balance of stuff to ice cream. I love that it has everything in it... Great when you can't decide what you exactly want.
--------------------
All Ben and Jerrys is good but this is one of my favorites. Theres a lot going on, and it always takes care of my ice cream craving.
--------------------
This is my all-time favorite ice cream ever! There are so many textures and tastes! Ugh I want some now just thinking about it!!
--------------------
I absolutely love cookie dough ice cream you can never go wrong with Ben and Jerrys.
--------------------
My fave by Ben and Jerry. Like the different cHunks of dough. I havent bought any in a while. Sometimes I notice my cups were loaded with goodies and other times not so much. Kinda inconsistent, but its been years. I should go buy a pint.
--------------------
Oh my goodness! So delicious and the perfect treat any time of the day! Some days you just need to come home and binge watch your favorite Netflix rom-coms and eat ice cream! This ice cream will make your insides feel better than any man ever could it tastes like you landed on the moon filled with all kinds of cookie dough goodness
--------------------
Probably my favorite B&J flavor. It is such a good mix of textures and flavors. I dont know if Jimmy Fallon had anything to do with development, but its great.
--------------------
By far my favorite flavor. Im a huge Jimmy Fallon fan so I had to try it when it came out. Then all the cookie dough and chocolate its just perfect.
--------------------
This was pretty good! It has all the flavors I love in ice cream. It was rich but also so satisfying. Anyone who is a fan of chocolate and baked goods in your ice cream are certainly going to love this just as much as I did!
--------------------
Definitely enjoyed this ice cream, could have done without the peanut butter cookies pieces thats just me. Loved the ice cream base and regular cookie dough pieces
--------------------
I mean, its just good! Always. Good rich flavor, creamy, and easy to find at my local grocery store.
--------------------
Yeah this is the best ... hands down! Cant go wrong with spoon full of greatness .
--------------------
100000% my absolute favorite ice cream flavor. I absolutely love all of the different flavors in the ice cream and it is full of the different cookie doughs! The texture of the peanut butter dough isnt my favorite, but it doesnt deter from the product
--------------------
Not my favorite flavor, Im not a huge fan of the PB dough pieces even though I love peanut butter. This is my husbands favorite flavor though!!!
--------------------
One of my favorite ice creams. It has brownie and cookie pieces. Its not too sweet and its filling.
--------------------
Ughh I love ice cream ! I a lactose...but hey you can never get enough of some ice cream!
--------------------
This one is probably my absolute favorite ice cream all the different tastes and textures in it I love them it goes very well together I was very sad when one of my stores got rid of it because this is like I said my favorite ice cream ever
--------------------
The BEST, most indulgent ice cream of all time!! This is my go to b&j flavor, its so delicious. Peanut butter, cookie dough, fudge swirls... you cant go wrong with this.
--------------------
Cookie dough chunk in it its so good. I loved this one and continue to buy it. The brand makes really good ice cream in general
--------------------
Favorite. Flavor. Ever. This pint is for those ultimate ice cream lovers. This isnt for a cheat meal...save this for a cheat DAY, because you will not want to stop eating it once you break the seal. It is gloriously excessive in all the right ways: every single bite has loads of cookie dough, peanut butter, brownie, or chocolate cookie chunks, and the ice cream itself is swirled with more chocolate indulgence. Me and my husband buy a pint apiece because we have failed many times to share nicely!
--------------------
So absolutely delicious. I can honestly it the entire tub in one sitting from how addicting this ice cream is!
--------------------
My top 3 favorite flavor of this brand for sure. All the flavors go well together and satisfy my sweet tooth craving
--------------------
Every once in awhile Ill treat myself to a Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream The Tonight Dough - 16oz ! Something about this particular flavor stands above the others in my opinion ! Theres so many textures and flavors coming from the two different cookie doughs! If you like chocolate, peanut butter and cookie dough... this is for you!
--------------------
The best ice cream in this entire world. I love cookie & brownie dough and this has it all!
--------------------
If I want to indulge this is my go to! (Insert mouth water) its so good with the caramel ice cream and cookie dough bits and then you have chocolate Icecream with chunks of peanut butter cookie dough. AND the cookie swirl throughout it all, Seriously sooo good.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite Ben and Jerrys ice creams. It is a wonderful option for cookie dough lovers who want something a little more interesting or different. I definitely recommend purchasing this flavor.
--------------------
This ice cream is the best! I love cookie dough and Ben and Jerrys quality of ice cream no matter which flavor you pick up is gonna make you taste buds explode! But the cookie dough one is just heavenly
--------------------
Ahhh its sooo good ! It has everything in it ! Chocolate chip cookie dough, peanut butter cookie dough, caramel, and a chocolate cookie swirl . Its cookie dough ice cream but richer in flavor . Its pricey for the size but worth the flavor .
--------------------
Best cookie dough ever! I cant say more its delicious, perfect bites and perfect amount!!! So so so good!
--------------------
I cant get enough of this flavor! I hadnt had it before until my boyfriend introduced me to it and now its one of my favorites.
--------------------
My absolute favorite out of all the flavors. It has everything i love into an ice cream
--------------------
This is my ultimate favorite ice cream flavor! Heaven bless ben and jerry's for creating this flavor with jimmy fallon. All of the cookies are combined in this flavor and it's simply amazing
--------------------
I love every flavor of Ben and Jerrys Ive had so far. This one is especially good and I get it a lot
--------------------
This is my favorite flavor of the Ben & Jerrys ice cream. I love cookie dough and the pieces are a pretty good size as well. It is rather pricey but in this case its absolutely worth it. Every chance I get I treat myself.
--------------------
Yum! Im not a huge fan of chocolate ice cream but this is so good because of all the other goodies mixed in with it. Ben and Jerrys are some of my favs bc I love the size, I dont mind trying new flavors.
--------------------
The perfect alternative to regular cookie dough ice cream! This has your standard chocolate chip cookie dough and peanut butter cookie dough mixed with chocolate and carmel ice cream. I gotta say my favorite part is the cookie crunch swirled in, gives you a nice crunch of texture every once in a while.
--------------------
The addition of peanut butter cookie dough is amazing. The cookie swirl is also equally amazing. A new favorite!
--------------------
This ice cream is the perfect size for you and a friend to share its yummy and doesnt melt fast the flavors really come through with its creamy goodness it is an affordable price and overall I purchase again
--------------------
Love cookie dough ice cream and this Ben and Jerrys flavor has tons of little tasty cookie dough bits inside.
--------------------
Best ice cream EVER! Absolutely hands down my favorite ice cream! Perfect amounts of cookie dough!
--------------------
This is my holy grail ice cream! I have been eating this for a year now ! I have to get it every time I go to Safeway! Very creamy and tasteful!
--------------------
This is by far my favorite flavor BUT the last one I got did NOT have any brownies in it.
--------------------
I cannot get enough of this ice cream! Obsessed!
--------------------
Best ice cream everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
--------------------
Love the brownie pieces and the taste overall, but I only found one piece of cookie dough throughout the whole thing. Very disappointed in that and the fact that that’s what I was most excited for.
--------------------
When I buy ice cream with chunks, I'm always disappointed with how few and little the pieces are. However, this ice cream is by far the most satisfying chunk-containing ice cream I've had so far! The chunks of fudge brownie and cookie dough are the size of my spoon AND are evenly throughout the pint. So ADDICTING!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
i buy this stuff all the time so i can gain some weight it’s insane
--------------------
Half baked has always been my go to flavor. Although I have ventured out and found other flavors I love, Half Baked is always the one I eventually go back to. I can’t get enough of the wonderful chunks of brownies and cookie dough! Yum yum yum!!!
--------------------
Bought this initially for the fun name & discovered its one of my favorite flavors!! Love it and will be buying more! Yum!
--------------------
Anything with cookie dough is a win in my book. Such a delicious flavor. Highly recommend!
--------------------
This is my favorite pint of ice cream. It has huge chunks of cookie dough and brownie. What more could you want?
--------------------
This was soooo good I finished it within like 20 minutes. It is kinda pricey but for good reasons. Honestly this ice cream will not disappoint you. Every time I go grocery shopping the first thing I look for is this ice cream.
--------------------
Didnt meet my expectations. I dont know there was just a lot going on. Was a good ice cream but dont think Ill get it too often.
--------------------
This ice cream is always a favorite to so many people I know. I agree with them its scrumptious!
--------------------
Hands down the best ice cream flavor in existence. I used to eat like 3 of these every week. So good and the cookie dough is the best!
--------------------
This is the best ice cream it is my all time favorite! Chocolate and vanilla with fudge brownies and chocolate chip cookie dough! Delicious. I especially like that it has a mix of flavors. Amazing
--------------------
First, Ben & Jerrys is an ice cream brand for the people. Ben & Jerry were quite literally protesting with people. So, this brand is the supreme ice cream brand. And its delicious and sooo rich & creamy!
--------------------
Ben and Jerrys half baked is the best flavor in the Collection if you hate nuts. It has brownie chunks and cookie dough chunks which are mixed into chocolate and vanilla icecream. They complement each other nicely and make this flavor irresistible!
--------------------
I actually have two of these in my freezer at this moment! lol!! i have to buy one of these every time i go to the grocery store
--------------------
This is my go-to pint! Its got a little bit of everything! It is worth every penny to get a more expensive brand when the quality of the ice cream is so good! I would definitely recommend this brand to brownie and cookie dough lovers!
--------------------
Delicious. This is the best tasting ice cream Ive ever Puchased from a grocery store. I loved the creamy consistency and the generous ingredients. Ben & JerrysNever disappoints. I would recommend this ice cream to everyone.
--------------------
When Im having a cheat day or half day, this is my goto. It is everything you could want in an ice cream and more!
--------------------
This is my all time favorite ice cream! Seriously the absolute best. Contains brownies, cookie dough, chocolate ice cream, and vanilla. Must try!
--------------------
I thought it was so funny when I found this ice cream. My fiancs two favorite ice creams are fudge and cookie dough. One day he could decide with he wanted and I found this! The name made me laugh and he loved it. I dont recommend eating the whole pint at once lol thats too rich
--------------------
Anything Ben and Jerrys is pretty delicious... but half baked is pretty close to the top!
--------------------
Ben & Jerrys has been one of my favorite ice cream bands for years. I used to get it with my grandma walking along the beach. This half baked flavor is by far one of my favorites. I love the cookie dough and the brownie pieces that are inside.
--------------------
Always a good go to flavor! I mean who doesnt like cookie dough am I right?! Can never go wrong with this one! First flavor I ever tried of Ben and Jerrys and I always find myself going back to it
--------------------
Ben and Jerry have always been there for me. They have never let me down. This is my favorite flavor and I can eat the entire pint in one sitting. I shouldnt, but I do. If I need some delicious ice cream in my life, I head to the store and find this container of happiness.
--------------------
This is absolutely my most favorite Ice cream flavor from them. Its just out right delish and if you have yet to try it, Id suggest doing so! No regrets if you love chocolate and cookie dough bites
--------------------
So so so good! Love the half baked the best especially when Im half baked or having a really rough week. Ive been getting this flavor for 10+ years. The taste is phenomenal and the price point is on point.
--------------------
Could always eat this one when really half baked it def lives up to its name. Eat with a movie on
--------------------
fave of all time. may be a little pricey but ben and jerrys is always worth it!! so tasty so simple and so well done. always a treat with every spoonful. definitely one if those flavor I go back to again and again
--------------------
This is hands down the best flavor ice cream of Ben and Jerrys. Hands down. Even though they have many great floaties this half baked is SO GOOD. its creamy and has all the goodness inside. I dont eat ice cream often but when I do, this is my go to!
--------------------
I absolutely love the flavor of this ice cream! You get the perfect mix of cookie dough, brownies and vanilla and chocolate ice cream! It is perfect for that time of month, girls night in, or just because ice cream is life.
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite ice cream in the world. I always get this ice cream when I want to treat myself. The cookie and brownie pieces in this ice cream are always moist and not dried out like some other brands. Ben & Jerrys also supports important causes!
--------------------
This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors of all time, but I don't eat much ice cream. I usually only buy it on April 20th.
--------------------
This is a delicious ice cream! It is my go to dessert, it is the perfect mix of chocolate and vanilla, with the chunks of cookie dough, it is so good! It is very creamy and a great size.
--------------------
Literally my number one favorite ice cream! Super delicious, and unfortunately super addicting. I definitely recommend for anyone that has a sweet tooth!
--------------------
This is my favorite Ben and Jerrys ice cream flavor. I love chocolate brownie ice cream and cookie dough ice cream, so the fact its combined is amazing!
--------------------
This is the BEST ice cream I've ever had hands down. It is my go to... It is the perfect combination of cookie dough and don't even get me started on how Delicious the brownie chunks in this ice cream are.I was beyond satisfied in this ice cream and would 100% recommend it to anyone.
--------------------
This is my favorite Ben & Jerrys flavor! Its deliciously sweet and very good priced. I always get this at my local grocery store.
--------------------
This has been my favorite ice cream flavor for YEARS! I love how it has huge chunks of brownie and cookie dough, and its not too chocolatey for me. I cant find any other ice cream that has the same elements as this one, which makes it super unique and will always have me crawling back!
--------------------
This is my favorite Ben and Jerrys product. It is a little pricey but worth the splurge. I would put more cookie dough then brownie. I am a repeat customer and will continue to be. I would recommend.
--------------------
Whenever someone asks me what flavor I want, this is my go-to and it never fails to disappoint. If you are a lover of cookie dough or brownie batter ice creams, this is a real ride or die. Yes, I am writing this review because I am craving some right now.
--------------------
If you want a full fat full calorie ice cream, dont reach for anything other than Ben & Jerrys! Nothing else compares to the creaminess and the variety of flavors!
--------------------
10/10. Best ice cream Ive had that is from a corporation. Perfect amounts of brownie and cookie dough
--------------------
My chidlren love this ice cream. They love that its like eating twi ice creams in one. It taste way better than the alternative products and is about the same price. This flavor is definitely not disappointing.
--------------------
This ice cream is perfect for when you need just a little extra chocolatey goodness. Its definitely worth the price!
--------------------
This is my boyfriend and Is go to for movie night. We can pick it up at our local grocery store, and it has become a staple for our date night ins. delicious and creamy!!
--------------------
Absolutely love half baked. It's my favourite flavour of Ben and Jerry's. A classic. I just wish they sold them in larger sized containers
--------------------
one of my favs from this company . i love cookie dough and i love brownies. this is a perfect union of both treats
--------------------
Yum ! Ben & Jerrys ice cream is the best. They have super creative flavors and I really like them.
--------------------
Its not my fav bc I dont love chocolate ice cream or brownie chunks HOWEVER it still is a delight and would never turn it down
--------------------
Best munchie ice cream. Brownie and cookie dough?! Its a stoners heaven. Love this ice cream
--------------------
Can you say delicious??? Growing up in Maine I was able to enjoy fresh Ben & Jerry's ice cream at out local beaches. The way they make their pints is so amazing and just like the fresh ice cream you get. This flavor is so so yummy.
--------------------
Ben & Jerrys Half Baked ice cream is my fianc and my all time favorite ice cream flavor. The pieces are so large and so good. However, You cannot go wrong with any of Ben & Jerrys flavors. 10/10 recommend.
--------------------
I love this ice cream its so good a little pricey but it tastes so good and has the right amount of added stuff in it
--------------------
This is good. Nice amount of chunks within the ice cream. Ive had it a couple of times but do like some of the other flavors better.
--------------------
This has been my go-to ice cream for YEARS! In high school my best friend and I would always share a pint over our Friday night TV binging. Years later I continue to have it and each time remember whythe fudge brownies are so rich melt in your mouth, the chocolate and vanilla ice cream are a perfect blend of not being too rich or too sweet. No other B&J has topped this as my favorite ice cream yet! Keep trying!
--------------------
This tastes very good but is a little but to chocolatey for my taste. I love how they are in small containers so I dont even have to grab a bowl! I wish there was more cookie dough in it though! I recommend if you love chocolate
--------------------
So delicious. I would say its their best flavor. Obviously not very healthy but good for a treat.
--------------------
Ive been eating this flavor since high school and its one of my favorites! I love it and it has every flavor you could want in an ice cream!
--------------------
I love Ben & Jerrys!!! They are definitely my favorite ice cream brand. Half baked is my go to flavor because there is so much going on. The only dislike I have that it is a little pricey for only a 16oz jar, but trust me its worth it! I just wish they made bigger tubs of it. But it is absolutely amazing!!!! Definitely recommend either Half Baked, Phish Food, or the Brownie Batter Core! :)
--------------------
This is probably one of my favorite guilty pleasures!! It has my favorite flavors and is very very tasty
--------------------
This is by far my favorite ice cream! Its smooth and delicious and filled with cookie fought bites and my favorite part the half baked brownie bites all swirled together in creamy vanilla and chocolate ice cream. I recommend this to everyone.
--------------------
Munchies anyone? I mean, come on, its Ben & Jerrys! Some of the best ice cream combos ever. You really cant go wrong with any of their treats. I cant say I have ever had a pint of B & J that wasnt drool-worthy! Plus, they have a great mission. *Doing a snap and this review applies to any and all goodies related to this brand of delishhhh.
--------------------
What can I say...Ben & Jerrys is the best! And who wouldnt love courier dough and half baked brownies in ice cream?! If I could eat this everyday, you can bet I would! When I was growing up we used to go to the Ben & Jerrys store every Friday to kick off the weekend. I love their ice cream.
--------------------
By far the best ice cream Ive EVER had! It combines all my favorite flavors with chocolate, cookie dough, vanilla and brownie. Would recommend to anyone with a sweet tooth!
--------------------
So delicious. It's a classic flavor that many like. I don't buy it often because it is so fattening, but it's a great treat. Super sweet and actually loaded with chunks!
--------------------
I am not one to gravitate towards ice cream but while on a recent vacation my sister had this so I decided to give it a try. Man I have been missing out for years now! I have bought one every week since returning from vacation. I make sure to fit some every couple of days in my macros for a treat. This will forever be my favorite flavor. It has tons of brownie bites and cookie dough bites and the perfect amount of chocolate and vanilla. LOVE!
--------------------
This is my favorite!! One of my pregnancy cravings so Ive been going through a lot of it lately. Its so delicious. I dont care if its pricey because Its worth it to me! [product:ben-&-jerrys-ice-cream-half-baked-16oz] #goodbyejuly
--------------------
Love this ice cream!! Great size, as its not too big so I can try new flavors often rather than being stuck with a single flavor. However it is a little pricey :/
--------------------
I absolutely love Ben and Jerrys ice cream its super delicious and really creamy. I also like that you get a ton of toppings they dont skimp! Its one of my favorite ice creams and I think its a pretty good price for what you get.
--------------------
Favorite. And I mean FAVORITE ice cream. Taste is amazing and has the right amount of each product in it. 100% recommend.
--------------------
I love Ben and Jerrys ice cream so much. This one the best! Its so creamy and delish. Love it.
--------------------
Best ice cream ever! Super flavorful! Cravings satisfied in one pint! Also perfect desert for the summer! Not too sweet
--------------------
I think the price is a bit high and it obviously needs to be eaten in moderation because we can let it overtake the desert because its quite rich but once every six months is doable
--------------------
One of my favorite Ben and Jerrys flavors. It has the perfect mixture of all the flavors. If youre unsure which ice cream flavor you are craving, this is the one for you! You are delighted with all of the flavors that are well loved.
--------------------
I loved ben and jerry soooo much! I am now keto so I cant have it but it is one of the best brands of icecream out there!
--------------------
This is my all time favorite one of their ice creams Im in love with this flavor the pieces of brownie and cookie dough are amazing
--------------------
Second the The Tonight Dough, this is my favorite Ben & Jerrys ice cream. I could easily eat the whole pint
--------------------
This is easily one of my favorite flavors that they have. You seriously cannot go wrong with it. it is absolutely delicious
--------------------
This is my favorite Ben and Jerrys flavor! Its got all that good stuff that I love in one place!
--------------------
If you don't like this flavor I have no idea what is wrong with you this is the best brownie cookie dough mix
--------------------
Half baked is the holy grail of ice cream. Chocolate ice cream with brownie chunks and vanilla ice cream with cookie dough pieces is the perfect combination. This is always my go to ice cream when I want a special treat.
--------------------
I always get this icecream when i find it. Has all the elements you need like the cookie, brownie, chocolate and vanilla icecream! Obsessed
--------------------
One of my favorites. Has the best combination and a good chocolate mixture. But isnt overwhelming with chocolate like the brownie batter one can be.
--------------------
Who doesnt like Ben and Jerrys ice cream?! Its amazing, thick and creamy. All the flavors are to die for and hit the spot perfect for an evening treat.
--------------------
My favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor ever! I love cookie dough & combined with brownie makes it even better Chocolate is always my weakness when I'm having a sweet craving. This ice cream is perfect, I wouldn't change it one bit. I would reccomend this brand over other options!
--------------------
I really like this! It's expensive but not as expensive as some others. I will say that I'm not as much of a fan of the brownie part of the ice cream. The cookie dough is the best part by far.
--------------------
Mmmmmm!!! This ice cream is spectacular! It combines some of my favorite things, cookie dough, brownies, and ice cream!!! I would really love to taste the outcome if they did this flavor will all chocolate ice cream as the base. Maybe they do that? Ill have to look around!
--------------------
Half baked is my second favorite Ben and Jerrys flavor. Behind only netflix and chilled. It has brownie dough pieces and cookie dough chunks as well. SO GOOD.
--------------------
A great flavor - seriously one of my all time favorites!! Ive loved this flavor for years and it is a classic
--------------------
One of my favorite Ice creams. It is full of cookie dough and brownie chunks and you can buy it almost anywhere. However, I will say its a bit pricey compared to other brands.
--------------------
This is my favorite ice cream. The size is perfect for one person. The mix of toppings in this ice cream is perfect. The taste is absolutely delicious and its amazing quality. I would recommend this to anybody who likes sweet ice cream.
--------------------
If you like cookie dough, like a lot, you will love this! This has way more cookie dough than the average ice cream and its high quality and overall tastes amazing!
--------------------
So good. I have always loved this flavor and this brand. They have by far the best flavors on the market.
--------------------
Love cookie dough and I love Ben and Jerrys so yay! Plenty of cookie dough bits inside.
--------------------
Oh my my my!! I LOVEEEE Ben & Jerrys Half Baked ice cream. I have on occasion ate a whole pint of this by myself. When Im craving something more than a simple flavored ice cream this is my first choice hands down. After a long day at work, nothing is better than a pint of good old Ben and Jerrys Half Baked, eating it with a spoon out of the carton in bed.
--------------------
This is my favorite ice cream of all time. I love having this as my after dinner snack. The ice cream is really smooth and the flavor is amazing. I love all of the bits in it.
--------------------
Best. Ice Cream EVER! Cookies dough, brownies, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream! all blended together for comfort in a cup! It's a very rich ice cream, so the little container can last you a while!
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite of all time! The sweet with the salty, perfection! The creamy marshmallow and chocolate covered almonds make this the most amazing flavor EVER!!
--------------------
Soooo deliciously good. Gooey marshmallow but so much chocolate and fudge! Taste like a smores
--------------------
this is everything. super gooey marshmallow.. the pretzel is more like a delicious salt ribbon swirling through. just enough almonds for a little crunch. perfection.
--------------------
One of the best flavors out there. My favorite Ice cream is rocky road. This is similar. Love the added pretzel
--------------------
I love Ben and Jerry’s so why would I not love this product.
--------------------
The combination of flavors is the ice cream flavor I never knew I needed! I’ve always been a half baked girl but after seeing this at the store I was tempted to try it and I’m so glad I did! I’m hooked! Delicious! Please keep making this flavor!
--------------------
This flavor was everything it is described as! Perfectly chocolatey with tasty chocolate covered almonds, marshmallows and chunks of salty pretzels. And I was worried about the salty pretzels like some other reviewers said, but I actually loved the amount of salt on them, I think they were a great contrast to how rich the rest of the ice cream is. Would definitely buy again, a great new version of an original Rocky Road
--------------------
Intensely chocolate gooey goodness. I am already planning on getting another pint!
--------------------
Hands down, my most favorite flavor from Ben & Jerry’s. The salty pretzels compliment the sweet chocolate. I’ve only ever been able to find it at Target so we make frequent trips to stock up.
--------------------
Delicious and fun to eat.
--------------------
I was concerned after seeing the reviews that the pretzel would be too salty, but it’s definitely not! I really like it. The salt counteracts the sweet marshmallow.
--------------------
I love, love, love this ice cream flavor and can't get enough of it!!!! Thank you, B&Js for coming up with this one!!! I now have my dad hooked on it, so I'm responsible for bringing it to him when I can find it. It truly makes my day eating this ice cream!
--------------------
This flavor is pretty good! I love the chocolate covered almonds! The only thing that I didn’t care for was the pretzel swirls, some pieces were a little too salty for me. Everything else was great.
--------------------
I just tried it last night and I’m on my 3rd rub! Please keep in the market!
--------------------
A bit too salty for me. I knew I wasn’t a pretzel person though
--------------------
If you love chocolate, crunchiness, and good texture, you will love this!
--------------------
Hands down the best flavor ever made!!! I stock up my freezer as much as I possibly can!!!
--------------------
I’m always trying to find the perfect balance between sweet and salty- and this is it!! The pretzel swirl is so delicious! I always buy multiple pints when I see this in the store.
--------------------
On behalf of all pre menopausal women... don’t let this one go. Crunchy and salty and marshmallowey chocolatey goodness. Best pint of ice cream I’ve ever eaten.
--------------------
I'd give this an 8 out of 10. The chocolate I good, and marshmallow swirl is awesome(which I love) and the chocolate covered almond chunks are fantastic. And it would be 10 out of 10 except the pretzel part is waaay too salty. if it were actual pretzel pieces it would be ok too But in the container I got, the pretzel part was like the texture of wet sand and just too salty. Zero crunch at all and no defined pieces. just this salty paste. But the chocolate, marshmallows and almonds are so good. I'm wondering If I got a bad container because reading other people's reviews of this flavor, they had pretzel pieces in theirs. which would have been 10x better.
--------------------
This is the best flavor of B&J that I have EVER had! I need more!!!
--------------------
I have a lot of favorite ice cream flavors but this is the best one, by far. I am OBSESSED with it, and they stopped stocking it at my local stores as well as the big box stores in my town about a year ago. I'm super sad about it, and still scour the shelf every single time, hoping it'll come back. The combination of flavors in this one is just perfect, hasn't been matched.
--------------------
Hands down best flavor out there, every bit of this complements each other, just fabulous!! It’s a must have, PLEASE keep it coming!!
--------------------
Glampfire Trail Mix has chocolate ice cream with chocolate covered almonds, a marsmallow swirl, and a pretzel swirl. The base and almonds provide alot of chocolate flavor that dominates the taste buds when eaten in isolation. The salty pretzel swirl gives a nice crunch and heightens the chocolate, giving it a sort of dark chocolate taste. It's a little overbearing but luckily the sweet marshmallow swirl balances the other components out, providing a great flavor when eaten as a whole. Very close in fact to a rocky road but done better. The only problem is the amount of marshmallow isn't enough. Perhaps I just got a pint with less marshmallow but without more of it, the salty chocolate taste can be overpowering. A great flavor when all the components come together but a little too strong on the chocolate taste otherwise.
--------------------
The. Best. Ever. Unreal tasty goodness in your mouth.
--------------------
Nice mix of texture and flavors. All the ingredients stand out without overpowering each other.
--------------------
By far my favorite ice cream!!!! Hate that it is an exclusive flavor, don't want to see it go!
--------------------
can barely taste marshmallow. would have been better if it was just pretzel. a chocolate covered pretzel in ice cream form
--------------------
Never have I ever left an Ice cream review and that stops here. Pretzels and ice cram go together like Freddie and Queen. I’ve been longing for a day where pretzels have made it into these precious pints and I will feel personally attacked if this flavor ever vanishes. Nice work B&J, prouda you.
--------------------
In love with this flavor. One of the best you've produced - please keep it around and offer more outlets for it in South Dartmouth MA!
--------------------
This unseated my long-mourned, lost favorite, Late Night Snack. Excellent.
--------------------
This is my favorite flavor right now. The chocolate ice cream is reminiscent of what I remember having as a kid, the pretzel swirl is just the right amount of salty with the chocolate and the surprise swirl of marshmallow round toss pint out to make the perfect bite.
--------------------
Just picked up this pint today, and was blown away by how deliciously rich, textured, and addictive this flavor is. I loved the chocolate covered almonds, the rich chocolate icecream, against the gooey marshmallow, and the nicely salty graham cracker. I am no fan of those cloyingly sweet salted caramels flavors, so I wondered if the salted graham crackers would work. It was perfect! This would be my icecream s’more of choice. Please make this a regular flavor!
--------------------
This flavor is my new favorite and I am super picky when it comes to ice cream!
--------------------
Discovered this one a couple months ago. I absolutely love it. Right amount of ingredients. So many other flavors just have way to many things crammed in there and I can't stand the core options. Please make this one permanent, pretty please!
--------------------
This ice cream is amazing- from the salty crunchy pretzel swirls to the gooey marshmallow to the surprises of fudge almonds. Please look at the reviews and make this permanent!
--------------------
This is your best yet! The perfect mix of sweet and salty :)
--------------------
I LOVE this new ice cream. The almonds add crunch and the pretzels are surprisingly delicious and compliment the rest of this perfectly salty sweet treat.
--------------------
No pretzel swirl in some of them! So disappointing! I feel you owe me my money back for lying to me.
--------------------
As an avid ice cream enthusiast I’ve eaten my fair share of ice cream, but this flavor is hands down the greatest I’ve ever had. I stumbled upon it in summer 2018 and then spent an entire year searching for it at every store I went into for the last year. I just found it again and I bought the entire stock. PLEASE make this a permanent flavor! I never write reviews on anything.... but felt compelled to expressed my love for this amazing ice cream!
--------------------
If you’re a chocolate lover and enjoy the regular s’mores flavor you love this one! I knew when I read the ingredients that I’d love it. From the very first bite to the last, it’s a flavor that I’ll never forget. It’s the perfect blend of chocolaty sweet and a hint of salty that will send your taste buds on a journey
--------------------
This flavor is now one of my top ice cream flavors of my life. The pretzel swirl is to die for, and the marshmallow swirl and almond chunks are a great addition. but really, that pretzel swirl is life. I hope it gets incorporated into more flavors! (In fact, a peanut butter world flavor with pretzel swirls might the best ice cream flavor I can imagine).
--------------------
I cannot believe this is not available everywhere!!!! I am a huge Ben and Jerry’s fan (like I get pints of B&Js instead of cake on my birthday).... this is my absolute favorite flavor! If I had a deep freezer I will just fill it with pints of Glampfire!
--------------------
This is the best flavor of ice cream ever. Seriously. My wife & I checked the ice cream section multiple times a week the entire winter hoping this would be back in stock. It’s finally returned! It’s been too long! I bought 5 pints.
--------------------
This flavor is so close to perfect. Only way it would be better is with more marshmallow and pretzel swirl. So GOOOOOD
--------------------
BEST FLAVOR EVER. The pretzel swirl is my favorite feature of any ice cream, and the fudge almonds are amazing with the salty pretzel. I was so disappointed when I stopped being able to find it in the store and really hope this flavor makes a comeback! I would make this a staple of my ice cream rotation :)
--------------------
Awesome ice cream! The add-ins to this ice cream are just terrific. The marshmallows and pretzels. I cannot stop eating this flavor. I hope you keep it in the rotation!!
--------------------
My all-time favorite, too bad it's an exclusive flavor and none of the stores near me carry it anymore. If it can't be a permanent flavor, I hope they at least decide to bring it back in the summer!
--------------------
I got this at Target and it was so amazing. I love ice cream and eat lots of it, and have tried many Ben and Jerry flavors. This was the best ice cream I ever had and my brother in-law agreed. Alas, I can't find it now and am heart broken. The lack of this flavor is driving me to try and make my own.
--------------------
Both my brother-in law and I agree this is the best flavor ever. We are so bummed we can't find it at Target anymore, please bring it back!!
--------------------
This ice cream would be in my top 5 favorite flavors. My number one is phish food and this tastes veryyy similar but in an original creative way! And it’s such a unique flavor. My only complaint is that it’s not available in all grocery chains!
--------------------
I absolutely love this flavor! The only thing I don't like is that its an exclusive flavor. It's the perfect mix of salty and sweet while the marshmallow adds an extra creamy texture. Really hope I'm buying enough to turn this to a regular flavor...
--------------------
I bought this because I love chocolate covered pretzels, but the mix of pretzels, almonds, and marshmallow is absolutely unreal. It was as if this flavor was custom tailored to my taste buds.
--------------------
I absolutely LOVE this ice cream! It’s an obsession at this point. Would love to see more of it in the stores. Yummy deliciousness!!!
--------------------
A perfect balance of both sweet and salty as well as a perfect concentration of almonds throughout to give it a nice crunch.
--------------------
ChubbyHubby is very rare up here in northern Maine. My go to is usually Phish food. I have FINALLY found the best of both worlds!
--------------------
I think Ben and Jerry’s does the best chocolate and fudgie flavors I’ve ever had, and this one is now exception. The pretzels were great tasting and nicely salty but was not so much a swirl and more chunks of pretzel here and there. The marshmallow was great and played well with the pretzel chunks against the chocolate background but honestly, the fudge covered almonds were kinda gross tasting and I had to eat around them. The real problem was that the pint wasn’t full! There was a big gap on the side of the container and that was rather frustrating. This came so close to being great but between the missing ice cream and the funky almonds, I think this one time will be my last for this flavor.
--------------------
This is exactly what I was expecting! The chocolate isn't too overpowering or overly chocolatey and the pretzel swirl gives just the right amount of pretzel flavor with a hint of saltiness. The marshmallow swirl adds a nice touch. Definitely my new favorite. I hope this one never goes away!
--------------------
My absolute favorite B&J flavor. Perfect combo of salty and sweet. I hope they never discontinue it.
--------------------
Just bought this this past weekend for the kiddos! My favorite flavor before was Half Baked, but I took a bite of my son's pint of this Glampfire Trail Mix and honestly was MIND BLOWN! The saltiness of the pretzelness mixed with the sweetness of the marshmallow is PERFECT. The perfect texture and you won't be bored because there's always complex, changing flavors throughout! SO DELICIOUS! This is our new FAVORITE
--------------------
This is a great mix of savory and sweet and the ice cream is very smooth. It's quickly become one of my favorites.
--------------------
Sinfully good. Indulgent. The perfect blend of sweet and salty and not too much of one or the other!
--------------------
I bought this last month and feel in love! The salty swirls are so delicious and the marshmallow took the show! I would have given this a 5 out of 5 based on that. But purchasing it again, it was basically chocolate ice cream with marshmallow. The pretzel swirls was NOT in my pint. Very disappointed in the hit or miss with the pints. I thought they was improving on this but that’s the second pint of this flavor with the skimpy mix ins. I get so disappointed when this happens being I only indulge once a week in ice cream so I want it to be good! Please work on this.
--------------------
Tried this flavor last week, was very excited for the combination but found it to be WAY too salty. I threw the carton out after a few bites. Very disappointed, could have been a great flavor. Spend your money on their better flavors, Phish food, Cheesecake, Half Baked, etc.
--------------------
I tried this on a whim, and it is now my absolute favorite flavor ever! The combination of chocolate ice cream with slightly salty pretzel bits and globs of gooey marshmallow along with fudge covered almonds is just perfect. Please let this be a regular flavor and not just a limited edition. Pretty, pretty please!
--------------------
I absolutely love the pretzel swirl and chocolate covered almonds in the rich chocolate ice cream with a marshmallow swirl. The only thing I would change is I wish the chocolate covered almonds were larger!
--------------------
I’ve been waiting for Ben and Jerry’s to bring back my favorite flavor. It was chocolate ice cream with marshmallow and Graham cracker swirls. This flavor is even better. It has the rich chocolate ice cream. The gooey marshmallow swirls. Slightly salty pretzel swirl and crunchy almonds. Perfection.
--------------------
This is definitely my new favorite Ben and Jerry’s flavor. The pretzel swirl has that perfect saltiness that is so addictive and pairs well with the chocolate ice cream. The fudge almonds add a nice crunch and the marshmallow brings it up a notch. Great job on this flavor! Love it very much!
--------------------
I have bought a pint of this every time I’ve been to the store in the last couple of weeks. Last time I went they were sold out and I died a little inside. Please keep this amazing flavor.
--------------------
The salty sweet crunch to creamy ratios are so perfect here. I am sad this is limited edition.
--------------------
The regular chocolate ice cream usually isn't the best but the salty pretzel swirly really elevates it to a new place. The combination creates a salted chocolate flavor that really keeps you coming back for more. Marshmallow swirls are always a good option over mini marshmallows and the almonds add a good crunch. I rounded this up to 5 stars but I would be interested in graham cracker or some type of pastry chunks along with or replacing the almonds. I just simply don't love almonds. Overall 4.5/5 Very good. Worth buying.
--------------------
This flavor has potential but needs better execution. The chocolate base is dark and goes well with the marshmallow swirl and pretzel swirl. There's some good texture with both swirls and a slight saltiness from the pretzel swirl. However, the swirls were buried in the bottom half of the pint in the center, and the chocolate covered almonds were few and far between. Maybe it was this one-off batch, but it needs improvement. Better mix-in distribution and more please!
--------------------
If you like heavenly hash icecream, this is just about the same thing. The marshmallows are very creamy, and the hint of salt from the pretzels accents the chocolate and almonds perfectly. This might be my new favorite flavor! Thanks Ben & Jerry.
--------------------
I think this just became my new favorite flavor. It is INCREDIBLE! the contrast between ice cream, cookie and peanut butter- perfect!
--------------------
My new go-to flavor! The milk chocolate combined with salty peanut butter and cookie crunch is heaven. I will continue to buy this flavor!
--------------------
If Ben & Jerry ever stop making Peanut Butter World, I will cry like I’ve never cried before; for days, weeks, or more likely, years.
--------------------
Just tried this after hearing raving reviews and it lives up to the hype. There are a ton of swirls and it reminds me of a homemade ice cream cake. Amazing.
--------------------
So glad I am not allergic to peanuts, this is my favorite flavor so far!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Rich creamy chocolate, peanut butter swirls, and crunchy chocolate cookie, whats not to like? sooo good, my favorite by far! I only wish I could find it more places!
--------------------
I am somewhat of a connesseuir of peanut butter and chocolate ice cream. This is hands down the best store bought I've ever had.
--------------------
I tried this a few months ago and have been addicted ever since. This has that perfect combo of chocolate and peanut butter. Amazing. <3
--------------------
Parent Trap would be proud. Chocolate Cookie and peanut butter dream. My favorite ben and Jerry’s yet!
--------------------
Favorite ever. Do yourself a favor and get this flavor.
--------------------
Peanut Butter World rocks my world. There is no other ice cream that exists in my life.  It’s helped me through difficult times and when it’s not available... I do my best to understand. It’s chocolate-y, peanut butter-y, luscious goodness. High quality flavors and high quality love packaged in a little itty bitty pint.  You can’t go wrong but if you go off of this review and decide not to go for it... I’ll be happy. That just means more for me.
--------------------
This is the best ice cream ever. It’s the only flavor I eat. The peanut butter is the very best flavor and the cookie texture is the bomb. I wish it wasn’t exclusive and I could find it more places. Love love love this.
--------------------
My favorite part about Ben & Jerry's is that they don't have corn Syrup in the ingredients. At least not with this flavor. I think their ice cream has remained the same and most wonderful and as corn syrup does horrible things to my skin, Ben & Jerry's gives me the ice cream i crave, without the breakouts.
--------------------
Just found this flavor today and ate the whole pint already. I love Peanut Butter Fudge Core and this is soooo much creamier and the cookies add a nice texture. Please don’t take this one away!!!
--------------------
Every time I think I have shaken off my love for this ice cream the combination of sweet chocolate and salty peanut butter drags me back in. The chocolate is sweet without being cloying, and the peanut butter offsets that perfectly. This is the ice cream I choose to splurge on (eat an entire container of) for my birthday.
--------------------
Totally addictive- incredibly rich. Our new all time favorite
--------------------
I love peanut butter and this ice cream is the best peanut butter ice cream I’ve ever tasted.
--------------------
I saw on here that they came out with this new flavor and I had to try it. I go to find it and I got the LAST one! I am blessed. This stuff is delicious and my new favorite type of ice cream. Highly recommend. This slaps!
--------------------
I love a good chocolate peanut butter combination and this is the best ice cream combo I've ever had. Please make this a standard flavor and sell it everywhere!!
--------------------
From the first bite I was in heaven! I LOVE the "chew" of the slightly salty peanut butter with the crunch of the cookie crumble. I seriously obsess about this ice cream.
--------------------
This is by far my favorite flavor and I wish they were sold places other than target. The ice cream is perfect and creamy, and the peanut butter is just right.
--------------------
I’m usually not a person who likes ice cream very often, like, at all. But this ice cream is so great it’s the only one I eat. I usually buy it  4-5 pints at a time because my target doesn’t usually have it, which is a big let down, but not the ice cream’s fault. I will admit, the peanut butter swirls being frozen makes it difficult to eat, but it is worth the struggle of getting a perfect bite. 10/10.
--------------------
Every time I need a peanut butter fix, this is my first thought
--------------------
It’s so good I couldn’t put the spoon down. I ate the whole pint . I couldn’t get enough of the flavorful goodness, bite after bite. Yummy in my Tummy!
--------------------
Yes. I can’t stop eating this even though I promised I was done with ice cream. It’s like the crumbly cookie from a Carvel Birthday Cake, and salty peanut butter. It’s become my favorite all time ice cream. Please sell it in all stores.
--------------------
I love chocolate ice cream with peanut butter and the cookie adds a great mix!
--------------------
This is hands down my FAVORITE flavor - and I have tried a lot! The combination of milk chocolate ice cream with the peanut butter swirls is amazing... then you add the chocolate cookie in there - to die for!!!
--------------------
This flavour is amazing! It’s like my favourite parts of the Tonight Dough, in its own pint. Can you please bring this one to Canada? I promise we love PB in the great white north.
--------------------
This is a tough one for me. I’ve tried 3 pints of this and the flavor is great. The chocolate ice cream base is perfect. It’s rich and creamy. The flavor of peanut butter and cookie swirls is also really really good. My problem is with how hard the swirls are. In my 3 pints, they were so hard that I could barely crack them with my spoon and they come out in one really big mass which makes eating the ice cream a bit of a wrestling match. But it all tastes SO good! It’s really decedent and rich and extremely filling. I will continue to buy it, I just wish it was easier to eat.
--------------------
This was an example of heaven on Earth. By far the best ice cream flavor yet to be invented. 14/10 recommend.
--------------------
This is my favorite ice cream flavor ever, and I’m addicted to ice cream! Only wish it was sold in more stores than just Target!!
--------------------
It’s just so good. While we try all the flavors, and have our favs, this is our default flavor.
--------------------
I've been buying this flavor for about three years now, and while I'm not a fan of ice cream typically, this is DIVINE. I buy it 4 canisters at a time at any Target I can find. Some may say it has too much peanut butter in it (or something similarly insane), but this is really the only ice cream on the planet that I enjoy. I only wish I could find it at more places.
--------------------
Im addicted!! Target shows this is an "exclusive & limited" flavor...PLEASE...dont get rid of this!!!
--------------------
This is my favorite ice cream, ever! So delicious.
--------------------
So this is the second pint of a peanut butter focused flavor (the first being peanut buttah core) where the swirls are rock hard and jammed in the middle of the pint! I don’t get it. I have had countless Ben and Jerry’s pints and most have been perfect but I have to admit this is really starting to bother me! It isn’t supposed to be this way. I don’t to stop exploring new flavors but I feel like maybe I should just stick to my tried-and-true favorites. I’m sorry to be a downer but I’m really not happy that 2 out of 2 peanut butter pints had inedible swirls and cores! I usually give gushing, glowing reviews on here and I’m not a hard to please jerk. I just want ice cream I can eat.
--------------------
If you love chocolate and peanut butter you will LOVE this ice cream!!! The chocolate cookie pieces take it to a next level.
--------------------
Made a special trip to target just to try all the new flavors and so far this is my favorite! If you like peanut butter you will love this! I think I’m going to need to make another hour trip to target again to get more!
--------------------
Had never seen this one before but it changed my life. Been a B&J's fan for as long as I can remember and this is definitely my new #1!
--------------------
This one is delicious and has great flavor and texture
--------------------
How can this flavor be called "Peanut Butter World" when 2 out of the 3 ingredients listed in the description of the ice cream are chocolate? And in the ice cream itself, it's 95% chocolate. Is this a joke? The title makes no sense. Where's the peanut butter in this peanut butter world? The description says "Milk Chocolate Ice Cream with Peanut Buttery Swirls & Chocolate Cookie Swirls". How did you come up with the title from those ingredients? I love Ben & Jerry's ice cream, but y'all put chocolate in almost every flavor, even when it doesn't belong and it's so unnecessary. I love peanut butter flavored everything and most peanut buttery treats aren't peanut buttery enough for me. I just don't like chocolate that much and because of that I was very disappointed with this flavor.
--------------------
I thought it would be to rich, but it was perfect!!
--------------------
This product is perfect! The peanut butter and the cookie swirls go so well with the milk chocolate.
--------------------
This is the best ice cream in the history of ice creams, ever. That is all. It is a party in your mouth. If you like peanut butter and chocolate, eat this. You will not regret it. Except possibly after you look down and realize you ate the entire pint in a euphoric daze.
--------------------
This is a MUST. I tried it for the first time about a month ago. I've been looking for it ever since. EUREKA!!! I found it again yesterday and bought two. I so love this flavor! THANK YOU for being so wonderful.
--------------------
PB World is my favorite ice cream flavor ever. It's hard to find on my town! If I can't find it, I go with my #2--Chocolate Fudge Brownie.
--------------------
I love all Ben and Jerry’s and this is my absolute favorite! I’ve been stocking up since it’s an exclusive. I would hate to see this flavor go, definitely should be added to the list of full time flavors!!
--------------------
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. TARGET RUNS OUT. HELP! RUINED FOR ALL OTHER ICE CREAM
--------------------
What a wonderful combination! I thought you couldn't beat the combination of chocolate and peanut butter, but you totally did when you added chocolate cookie swirls to the mix. Thank you! Please keep making this flavor, it is my favorite by far!
--------------------
I have bought it twice in the last month and have ate it within a day! Best ice cream flavor i have ever had! Hands down!
--------------------
I can only find this at Target. From the first bite I immediately consumed the whole pint. Totally worth it. I love peanut butter Swirls and ice cream and the nice cookie crunch was a pleasant surprise. This is the only ice cream I will eat from now on
--------------------
This is my new favorite! I hope Ben & Jerry's always carries Peanut Butter World because it makes the world a better place :)
--------------------
I'm always searching for ice cream with peanut butter and often disappointed by the sparse amounts of peanut butter. The peanut butter world ice cream has the perfect blend of peanut butter and chocolate. I hope this flavor remains available!
--------------------
This is the best flavor Ben and Jerry's has come out with!
--------------------
This ice cream is amazing. Never ever get rid of it!!
--------------------
please never take this flavor away its amazing im so inlove with it please keep it 10/10
--------------------
This is the only flavor I buy anymore. It is the epitome of ice cream. I dare anyone to try it and say otherwise.
--------------------
I've never eaten a better flavor of ice cream. My life is changed. Ben & Jerry's is incredible, and Target sales (2 for $7, heck yes) make my world.
--------------------
Two pints for $7.oo? Ok! I grabbed Peanut Butter World & gave it a go.. This stuff is FIRE! I've never been so obsessed with ice cream like this before.
--------------------
Best iced cream ever, I hope they make it an offical vs exclusive flavor
--------------------
I always stock up on this icecream when I see it at my local Target because it sells out so darned quickly. I've tried about every icecream pint flavor known to mankind, and this hands down is the one I keep buying over and over again. It's THAT good!!! How I maintain my girlish figure while this is in existence is beyond me. Target, please, please don't stop carrying this flavor. Please.
--------------------
The sale price on this flavor caught me off guard, especially compared to the regular price of my favorite pint of Half Baked, but now it's become my new favorite. The peanut butter flavor blends perfectly with the milk chocolate ice cream, and chocolate cookie swirls are a great accent. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 21st century of ice cream.
--------------------
This is the best ice cream I have ever had!
--------------------
This is the perfect and best ice cream combination, no discussion.
--------------------
I may regret saying this in public, but his is truly the best ice cream I've had. I'm already having trouble finding this in stock, so I guess that the word is out already. I will knock you flat on your back if we are both going for the last pint in the store. Fair warning.
--------------------
I was hooked on the same few flavors. One day in target I stumbled across this and thought I'd give it a try since I'd never heard of it. OMG!! My husband & I both agree this was the best flavor ever...even better than our beloved Phish Food! I can't find it anywhere except Target which is a bummer. If you see this flavor...buy it! If you are a chocolate/peanut butter lover you won't regret it!
--------------------
This is the best ice cream I have ever had...for anyone that likes chocolate and peanut butter, this is a whole new ball game!!
--------------------
I have tried every single Ben and Jerry's flavor in existence... even the store-exclusive flavors sold only at [...]. This is the best flavor by far... with a catch: you must like peanut butter. The milk chocolate base of this pint combined with oreo-like crumbles and messy/delicious/salty peanut butter results in the best ice cream I have ever tried. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite ice creams. If you tend to have problems finding ice creams that settle on your stomach (as i have) this is one that works. It's very light and taste delicious. I can eat a whole jar in one sitting.
--------------------
I buy this about 3x a week, I eat it every night. Wish there was just more caramel
--------------------
More Flavor Plz. I really liked the crunch of cookie in it but......needs more flavor.
--------------------
I absolutely love this ice cream, it’s one of my favorites all time, and my favorite Talenti. I will say I agree with other reviews where it may need a bit more caramel, but even the vanilla and cookie crumble is SO good, that those bites without the caramel are still delicious!
--------------------
This was very bland. Just had not taste to it. I added some thin Oreos to help it out and I wouldn’t buy this again
--------------------
The best flavor yet! new to gelato but I’m hooked on Caramel Cookie Crunch!!
--------------------
I absolutely love the crunchy cookie bits!
--------------------
I'd write about how it tastes if I could get it OPEN?! What on earth why is this so hard to open? Really though, how am I supposed to get it open? I've been trying to so long it's all melted inside... This is stupid
--------------------
Had little to no Carmel and also a watery taste to it
--------------------
This doesn’t really taste like gelato, more like Halo ice cream, but with a much higher calorie count. The caramel and cookie crunch were also negligible.
--------------------
It is light and lovely, just not exactly what you need if you’re after something rich with more caramel (it is barely there) and cookie crunch, I agree with other people here. Not my favorite Talenti choice.
--------------------
Doesn’t taste much more than vanilla.  Needs more caramel swirl and bigger cookie pieces.  Really liked their layered varieties instead.
--------------------
It's pretty light for something that has caramel in it. Lovely flavor. I love the cookie crumble, we love a good texture! It's my new favorite!
--------------------
This is my daughters favorite brand of ice cream & I bought some for her birthday. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is her preferred flavor so I gave her 2 & a Carmel Cookie Crunch. I kept one to try for the first time & to date I have eaten one a day over an 8 day span. Only negative is they need a larger size! #SILENT4CE
--------------------
I bought this 3x in addition to the Dulce De Leche because I thought that the stores I was going to may have left them out because it has a spoiled taste now. I used to love it but now I can't because I can't shake the spoiled milk taste. Sorry but until they change whatever it is that is causing that .. I can't do it because how would I know if it is really bad or if that is just the taste.
--------------------
This is the best flavor of ice cream!! Its so good, i can finish a whole tub in one sitting. This SMACKS!
--------------------
My first time having this and it’s so good Ready to try more flavors
--------------------
One if their best flavors for sure whenever they start making bigger tubs I’ll definitely buy !!
--------------------
So creamy, taste like heaven. I have never enjoyed Ice cream that much before but when I tasted this gelato I was so pleasently surprised.
--------------------
As much as I love your products, the lids on them are awful. The last few times I've bruised my hand trying to open them. I really wish you'd change the packaging but I know it won't happen. I've had to throw the ice creams away because what's the point of keeping them if I can't open them. Waste of money on a otherwise decent product.
--------------------
I've never had anything from Talenti before, but I've always eyed it up. My husband brought some home today and I was super excited to try it because the only other Gelato I've had has been amazing. It's like I left milk in the freezer far too long. Almost 0 flavor, and the texture was as if it was freezer burnt. The tiny bit of caramel that existed was only on the outside, and the teeny tiny pieces of cookie were too small and sparse to help the lack of flavor otherwise. Had the gelato itself had flavor, the cookie size and portion would be acceptable. Wondering if I should try any other flavors, because now I have a rather pricey pint of garbage in my freezer.
--------------------
This is my favorite flavor. I live the caramel and bits of chocolate in it!!
--------------------
I am a huge fan of Talenti and serve it often as a frequent dinner hostess. This flavor has left me cold! I think they mean cookie "crumbs", the caramel is is so blah and way too little of it for the entire container and not sure what the crunch is supposed to be.
--------------------
So yummy and caramelly, with the perfect amout of crunch!
--------------------
MY CARAMEL COOKIE CRUNCH DID NOT HAVE THE CARAMEL INSIDE AT ALL.
--------------------
If you love Creamy and you love Caramel and you need an added Crunch, this is the Gelato for you. It's so creamy against your tongue. The moment you try this, you will be addicted for life. It happened to me.
--------------------
A perfect flavor combination just the right amount of caramel and cookie mixed in with the best gelato ever.
--------------------
love the taste, texture and flavor! favorite ice cream
--------------------
It’s unfortunate that it seems common place for the swirls to be prominently displayed on the sides of the containers implying a lot of caramel, when the reality is that there is very little. The two small clumps were heavenly, but the rest lacked the proper oomph.
--------------------
Tonight I tried the Caramel Cookie Crunch for the first time. It looked so good before it was opened. It looked like it had quite a bit of caramel. All of the caramel in it is what you see on the outside of the container. I thought it would be swirled throughout. There was such a small amount of caramel that I inly tasted it in two bites. It was very disappointing seeing as the caramel was the whole reason I purchased it!
--------------------
Love this flavor and espacially the crunch and the caramel mixed together.
--------------------
This right here is PERFECTION! I’m obsessed with the Caramel Cookie Crunch gelato. It’s so good
--------------------
So this was my favorite flavor of talenti, but it started to disappear from stores several months ago, and I could barely find it. Now it’s back though and I purchased it tonight after not having it for a little while and something is different. There seems to be a different after taste left and something not as good as I remember. Is it just me or did you guys change the way you make it? If so the old way was better
--------------------
Tastes just right not soggy or anything still crunchy and delicious and creamy
--------------------
Incredibly disappointing. The only caramel to be found were tiny dribbles along the side of the container making it look like caramel was a primary component. Once the container was purchased and opened, it was a real let down with barely a hint of caramel. It was a generic vanilla with a few cookie pieces and not much else. Talenti, if "Caramel" is the first word on the label I would expect it to taste like caramel. I'll never buy this flavor again.
--------------------
I went to 3 grocery stores looking for caramel cookie crunch and cant find it anywhere. Please Please Please tell me you guys arent getting rid of it, and if you are I need to find somewhere else carrying it so I can buy their remaining stock. As someone with lactose issue Talenti is the ONLY thing that doesnt have me sick to my stomach.
--------------------
Why in the world do you guys keep changing the recipes? That’s all I have to say.
--------------------
I love this ice cream I wish I could have them all
--------------------
The Carmel Cookie Crunch was the first Talenti Gelato I tried. I shared it with my husband once and now he thinks I’m supposed to all the time. When I’m enjoying my gelato now I’m wrapped up in my blanket with the lights out so no one can have any.
--------------------
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS FLAVOR! Warning---VERY ADDICTING! This is my Go-To! Love how the smooth cream and sweet caramel swirl together with an oreo-type cookie crunch. How you can get a crunch is amazing! The only bad thing about this gelato is when you get to the bottom of the pint and want more.
--------------------
This used to be really good. Just got it again and it completely changed. Would not buy again. Not nearly as much caramel. No crunch anymore. Pretty bland flavor.
--------------------
As a Product Demonstrator at a prestigious market I had my first taste (and 2nd) of Talenti Gelato during the store's demos, so I knew the quality of the product upon purchase. I chose Caramel Cookie Crunch Gelato (CCCG) based upon my likes & the reviews here of all my choices available. The taste of CCCG is definitely 5-Star quality & rates with those other top-tier products you find everywhere . My issue is concerning the caramel - especially it being the first word of your product. The taste of it was awesome... when I found it in my sample in two mini pools, not as a "swirl" as seen in the above pic - and not worthy of "Caramel" headlining the product name. Of lessor issue is the "crunch" portion; although I crunched every bite I think the pieces s/b a little bit bigger. So, in conclusion, I'd say I really purchased "Mini Cookie Crunch with Caramel".
--------------------
Thank you, Talenti for creating this scrumptious gelato flavor! In my humble opinion, it is the perfect combination of cookies, caramel, and cream! It's absolute heaven in my mouth! Please, don't stop making it!
--------------------
This was my first. And like all first, unforgettable. It was like an explosion of happy in my mouth!
--------------------
I seen an advertisement on Twitter the other day. So yesterday, after checking ingredients because of my allergies, I picked out this flavor. It tastes mostly plain, not much crunch or caramel flavor. So honestly, I am sadly disappointed.
--------------------
This stuff is sooooooo gooooodddddddd. Like omg!!!!!!! Its like an original blend of chocolate and vanilla, but not to much chocolate where it taste boring, but like hints of chocolate which makes it sooooooooooooo delicous. And need I remind the Caramel!!! Ohmygod. This thing is so fantstic like yu have to try it.
--------------------
I love this flavor a lot!!! I would really recommend you try it!
--------------------
One of my favorite ice creams. So sad that we can't buy this in Norway.
--------------------
I’m going to do my best to put into words my love for this flavor. The dulce de Leche swirl is EVERYTHING! Those chocolate covered chocolate cookie pieces are the perfect amount of chocolate not too much not too little just perfect! And the GELATO THAT PUTS IT ALL TOGETHER IS BEYOND HEAVENLY! Not vanilla but a sweet cream flavor! If it sold by the gallon I’d eat a whole gallon at a time. Perfect for all occasions between just cause ice cream and ugly crying on the couch ice cream.
--------------------
I tried Talenti when I was looking for a new treat to indulge in! There were so many flavors to choose from, but this one sounded like a yummy place to start. I love the crunchy cookie bits, the carmel ribbon, and the delicious vanilla base. I haven't been able to bring myself to try any other flavor yet!
--------------------
Anytime I'm craving ice cream i get this all for myself. Its not too rich or too plain. Perfect midnight schedule!
--------------------
This is the one. This is the best flavor. Highly recommend
--------------------
I love this product. I bought it by accident when my daughter grabbed the wrong icecream and i didn't notice until i was home watching a movie and she brought it to me and I was upset because it was not the kind i like but boy was i wrong. I LOVED IT FROM THE 1ST BITE AND HAVE NOT TURNED BACK!!!!!. I will travel all over town to buy it and if there are only 2 ir 3 in stock I buy thrm all just to be sure i dont run out lol. This is my cheat food for myweoght loss journey and i work out hard just to be able to enjoy it. Thanks so so much to whomever created this flavor!!!! Bring back the quart sizes please.
--------------------
One of my favorites. I’m not a fan of cookies and creme but cookies and Carmel now that is where it’s at!
--------------------
This is the second best caramel flavored one out of the rest
--------------------
I absolutely LOVE this flavor of Talenti!! The Caramel, Smooth Vanilla Gelato, and Crunchy Chocolate Cookie bits are a perfect combination for a most tasty treat!! I highly recommend this flavor for any and every triple dessert loving individual - Three treats in one - Caramel, Cookies, and Gelato - YUM!!
--------------------
This is the only flavor I got hooked on! It needs 20 stars ⭐️
--------------------
I love the textures of this gelato! The flavors aren’t so overly sweet all at once and that makes you really appreciate the dense Carmel swirls.
--------------------
It was so good and rich and creamy I didn't even know it was gelato until I was told so. It's so yummy and now I'm always looking forward to it.
--------------------
this is literarly my favorite ice cream ever. so good and scrumptious and for someone who loves caramel, its perfect. its light and scrumptious
--------------------
Love this flavor, it’s mine and my kids favorite...just wish there was a little more Carmel and cookies!!
--------------------
A little shy on actual ice cream content but tasty nevertheless would definitely not reccomend to others because then I’d never find anymore for myself. Stores don’t stock much of these pints so when you find something good, best keep it to yershelf!
--------------------
The container looks like it has a healthy amount of caramel swirled in it... it doesn't. The caramel is drizzled along the inside of the container. The icecream is just vanilla with cookie bits. Utterly disappointed!
--------------------
Tried it out while I was traveling one night. Went back the next two nights. I’m hooked
--------------------
Both my wife and I found this to be completely bland. We had it with the peanut butter cup flavor, which had a lot of flavor, but this one is really almost nothing.
--------------------
It's so delicious I love a little cookie crunches I just wish it had a little more dulce de leche [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This was such a disappointment. So flavorless. I can't understand the good reviews. I would never buy this again.
--------------------
The taste is amazing in each bit!! Just the perfect amount and right size for one person.
--------------------
the new font on the container was not the only thing that changed, i also noticed the recipe. less creamier and less swirl with a more cheap taste. this was my favorite at one point, now i dont know.
--------------------
I thought it was a fluke but unfortunately I think that’s this is just a tweak to the recipe. Less flavor and less creaminess. Very disappointed.
--------------------
I was a bit skeptical about it, but decided to give it a try. I’m speechless where have Talenti Gelato Cookies Caramel Crunch been all my life?! It extremely smooth and delicious, creamy. I loved it and definitely will be my ultimate favorite ice cream.
--------------------
I try to not get the same flavor twice so decided to give this a try. The caramel (reason I decided on this flavor) to ice cream (I don't like vanilla on it's own) ratio seemed very off to me. I would have liked for the caramel to be much more apparent.
--------------------
pretty tasty but needs way more caramel, there's barely any in it
--------------------
It tastes amazing. I love it!!!
--------------------
This has to be the absolute best frozen dessert known to man kind!! This gentle textured gelato gives you the perfect balance of crunchy and smooth that’ll make your taste buds thank you. So pleased with the product, I will be stocking my freezer full before summer time hits.
--------------------
The Carmel was so rich and smooth, it maintain a smooth texture. That bleneded with the ice cream and cookie flavors was great.
--------------------
Anytime I’m craving something sweet-Caramel cookie crunch is the way to go!
--------------------
Omg this is the best ice cream i tasted in forever first the Carmel not too thick it’s just right the church is a delightful taste i wasn’t expecting the flavor of the actual ice cream is unbelievably delicious and all in all I’m addicted to this flavor
--------------------
This flavor is overall very delicious. The gelato is smooth and creamy and the cookie pieces add a hint of chocolate with some crunch. The only thing I would suggest is a bit more caramel but that’s just my preference.
--------------------
I've never had Talenti before and I won't buy again. The dulce de luche swirl is a joke, it's just a few ribbons on the side of the container to make it look like it's there, but that's it. Also, the texture of the gelato was not rich and creamy, it had a looser, thinner texture that I associate with light ice cream. Finally, the cookie pieces were really tiny so you couldn't even taste them.
--------------------
The best ice cream flavor, hard to not eat the entire pint in one sitting. Will buy again!
--------------------
I live and breathe this ice cream. Its soo delicious and creamy. Its a bit pricey but it is completely worth it
--------------------
This flavor is good. My only issue is they don't have as much caramel or cookie bites as in the photos. So it's mostly just vanilla ice cream. There's not much cookie crunch pieces, and even less caramel. But the bites of those you do get are very good. I just wish there were more.
--------------------
This brand of gelato is amazing, I tried this brand a couple of weeks ago and I have been hooked ever since. And the caramel cookie crunch is just.... I have no words for how amazing this taste . Thank u talenti for making such amazing flavors can't wait to try more:)
--------------------
Amazing gelato! So tasty! I can tell this is a high quality gelato and buy it every time I see this flavor in stock! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
If I had to guess what heaven tasted like, it would be this gelato. Sweet but not too sweet and just SO YUMMY. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
It was a perfect blend of cookie and vanilla. Soo good and will definitely try all their other flavors. The new layers look so good as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Delicious! I love the chocolate cookies and ribbons of dulce de leche caramel. I am absolutely addicted to this ice cream, can’t get enough!
--------------------
The. Best. Gelato. Ever. Its so rich and creamy and flavorful. I wish it was a little more affordable for gelato but its worth it and usually a promo going on.
--------------------
My boyfriend showed me this brand, and it is fantastic! As I got older, I grew out of eating traditional ice cream (unless it is a milkshake) and I feel like this replaces it so well. Its packed full of flavor, but its light. So bomb!
--------------------
Talenti is absolutely my go to ice cream brand now! When Im not trying to binge eat the entire container, I can actually get 4 satisfying servings out of this, and it tastes way better than normal ice cream!
--------------------
Yum! This stuff is so good! Such a perfect size container for the freezer too! Love tons of there flavors!
--------------------
This flavor is delicious but can be a bit too sweet for me! Its not my all time favorite of Talenti, but its definitely a favorite for my family. If you want to try it out, I would totally recommend this flavor!! Its yummy and flavorful and has delicious lil cookie bits in it.
--------------------
Yummy, but pricey! For such a delicious gelato I am willing to splurge, but it is not an every week purchase. Hidden bonus? The containers are reusable! It is much better than other brands for taste, and is more natural.
--------------------
This stuff is always so expensive but never once have I had it and thought it wasnt worth it. Talenti never disappoints with their flavors. The texture is light. Flavor is impeccable. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.
--------------------
Favorite Talenti flavor and probably one of my favorite ice creams period. Much more consistent than some of the other flavors *cough cough chocolate chip (no) cookie dough*
--------------------
flavor was fine but I was expecting way more dulce de leche. it was basically drizzled in the container than filled with ice cream so I had to scrape the jar to get any DDL in the mix.
--------------------
Great, now that I have your attention. Would the specialist and creators at Talenti please make this flavor Dairy free as well!!! I love this flavor so much, but some of us wants to cut out the dairy!. Lol absolute favvv!!!.
--------------------
I do really enjoy this flavor, but the look of the outside is a little bit misleading. It shows a lot of swirls of caramel, but when you're actually eating it, you'll notice that the caramel swirls are ONLY on the outside and not in the middle, so you don't really get much of it. Don't get me wrong, it's still amazing! But I wish there was more caramel.
--------------------
Friggin delicious. I could eat this whole container if I was left alone with it. So creamy.
--------------------
I agree with the writers "false advertisement" and "not like photo on box." I too have bought Breyers for years and the three flavor was my favorite but found recently that there are no longer the vanilla bean specks in the vanilla and much less strawberries and a slightly different taste of the chocolate as well as a smaller box. I called to ask about this and the woman who answered phone was nice but seemed not to know much about the ice cream and said that the recipe hasn't changed (but it seemingly has sadly)...
--------------------
I have purchased Breyers ice cream exclusively for years. The last three boxes of the vanilla, chocolate, strawberry were not up to standard. The most obvious problem was visually apparent when the top cane off. Right there is the picture on the lid and the actual product. Lid-lots of strawberries... ice cream virtually no strawberries (see photo). This photo has remained unchanged. The cream has not.
--------------------
I bought this ice cream twice ! I have always bought it because of the natural vanilla specs and flavor. It was my favorite. But they stop making it like they used too. Very sad
--------------------
Ate this flavor for 15 years until I tried Edys and Turkey Hill. Many years ago I would have said that breyers is way better than Turkey hill. Sure Breyers has a more natural ingredient list, but it loses as far as consistency, taste, and added sugar. Turkey Hill tastes far better and has a few grams less sugar. Breyers Ive found the quality is inconsistent batch to batch. Other ice creams are smoother and have more taste despite using less sugar than Breyers
--------------------
I’ve been buying Breyer’s ice cream all my life. One of the greatest treats my mother and father could give me was buying your Vanilla, Chocolate and Strawberry ice-cream, but my most recent purchase of this product proved most questionable as to your standards. The “Natural Vanilla” was no more than your generic store brand vanilla with no vanilla beans. The chocolate and strawberry tasted subpar to the product you normally produce; the chocolate lacked a strong coco flavor, but still maintained a full body. The strawberry also seemed less flavorful, but also maintained its expected body. My primary grievance is the quality drop in your vanilla ice cream. You advertise Natural Vanilla but are no longer producing.
--------------------
These three flavors are a creamy delight and flow so fine in my mouth. It's just a heavenly, tingly feeling whenever I have this ice cream for my dessert.
--------------------
The best of three worlds. Just natural flavor. perfect for what ever mood your in. If you want to add banannas, nuts, or sauce it will be perfect every time .
--------------------
I love vanilla chocolate and strawberry and they're all together in one ice cream instead of having to buy three different ice cream as I do find it expensive but I think it's very well worth it because they all blend really well I have bought it more than once and I would definitely recommend it to others
--------------------
Im not personally a huge fan of strawberry ice cream so I tend to avoid it, but the vanilla and chocolate are delicious! The ice cream is super creamy and is very good!
--------------------
So good! Love these. Very smooth and creamy taste! One of my favorite products from this brand!!
--------------------
I love how this riche creamy ice cream taste it is so affordable and taste so delicious and you can have more than one flavor. Also you can get it at any local store.
--------------------
I like this product because have three flavor in one package, more variety! Is good when you have kids with diferent preferences.
--------------------
I really enjoy Breyes Ice cream brand. All the flavors are delicious and I will keep buying it
--------------------
This is another go-to for our family. I always get Breyers. Nothing compares to the creaminess and the flavor of this ice cream. My kids love it too.
--------------------
You get a taste of all 3 flavors. Not expensive . Very tasteful . Very creamy . Chocholate!
--------------------
Yummy fresh good box very tasty good price very healthy makes a great snack Good value. Yummy in my tummy.
--------------------
Best ice cream for kids. Everyone loves it, but not as much as little girls. Recoomend it to share with all your family n friends. Best ice cream n size to feed for a nice kid birthday party.
--------------------
This is usually my families go to. It has the three basic flavours and you can pick. It might seem boring, but mix all these together and you wont regret every bite you take!
--------------------
I love 3 flavours ice cream! I always get this when I am in the mood for more than one flavour. Very creamy and full of taste!
--------------------
I love the breyers ice cream. I love variety of flavors and it taste great. Delicious.
--------------------
Best napolitean ice cream out there! In one scoop you can taste all of the flavours perfectly and its cheaper to buy this than only vanilla ice cream because you can taste a lot more in just one little box. Plus it is cheap and you can find it at your local store.
--------------------
I recently bought this ice cream to try this brand because has good prices and choose this one to taste three different flavors but I didnt like the chocolate because it to bitter and strong. I am not sure if I will buy this again.
--------------------
This is hands down the best ice cream in the entire world. No one can argue with that! It’s so delicious.
--------------------
I really love this ice cream. This ice cream is always a must have at home. It’s a staple at home. Something we always look forward to enjoying after dinner or in the summer.
--------------------
This is perfect if you want a bit of all three flavors or if you have a group that cant pick one. It is incredibly delicious
--------------------
Birthday cake and ice cream. The perfect combination. I like that this has real strawberry chunks in it
--------------------
I love it I mean who wouldn’t like three flavors in one scoop? The taste is super good and is super creamy
--------------------
This keeps everyone happy because it has three flavors in one. It can be used for a Banana Split.
--------------------
Always such a hard ice cream to scoop! It’s not creamy/smooth. It has good flavor but it can’t beat blue bell.
--------------------
This is my favorite, I mix them all together and they taste to much better! This is my go to brand and my go to flavor. Highly recommend it always
--------------------
Love brewers it’s so good, soft tastes amazing and never disappoints. This is a classic family brand.
--------------------
A classic! Three ice cream flavors in one! I have bought this many time especially for Birthday parties cause it pleases ppl with the three different flavors
--------------------
Creamy and natural tasting . Tastes homemade . Great with chocolate sauce or marshmallows
--------------------
Very tasty! I love the three flavors. It is perfect for making frappe. I buy 5 a month, because me and my family love this ice cream.
--------------------
Breyers is always my go-to ice-cream brand. As a lover of all things ice-cream, I am very picky about textures and flavors. Breyers is both the perfect texture, and the perfect flavor combination.
--------------------
This ice cream is our favorite. Pick from all 3 flavors or just have them all. This ice cream is Rich and creamy!
--------------------
I love Breyers Neopolitan ice cream. It doesn’t matter how cold it gets I could sit and eat this all day
--------------------
This is the best ice cream! Three flavors! It can't get any better than that. If you're having a couple of friends over this is the kind I would get, it makes everyone happy!
--------------------
I’ve bought Breyers a few times and I’ll continue to buy this brand. This flavor was ok for the most part. The chocolate doesn’t have much flavor to it and the vanilla is very sweet. It’s like when you buy vanilla ice cream and it’s yellow and it just taste a little funny. The strawberry is the best flavor out of the three. The chunks are okay but the ice cream itself is pretty good. I’ll maybe (more likely than not) buy it again.
--------------------
This is my favorite ice cream. It’s so soft and creamy. It’s perfect for my house because I like vanilla, my daughter likes strawberry, and my boyfriend likes chocolate. It’s also really good to eat them all together. And he strawberry has real pieces of strawberry in it! Super good with whip cream and cherries!
--------------------
Breyer's ice cream is super creamy and perfect for any sweet tooth cravings! I love almost all the flavors they have to offer! Satisfying and delicious!
--------------------
This is the classic ice cream we always buy for birthday parties! So everyone can get a little taste of all the flavors. Ever since I was little we always bought this kind of ice cream to eat with cake because it had all three flavors! I live this ice cream and recommend it to anyone.
--------------------
All three great flavors in one box! Brewers has the best ice cream and it’s affordable and easy to find because it’s carried in many stores!
--------------------
This is my second favorite when the snickers is not available. Very creamy very delicious cant go wrong. The strawberry in the combo is to die for! I can eat it in one seating which is not good lol affordable and always available. Very satisfying and will recommend.
--------------------
I've been eating Bryers since I was a kid. This is the only ice cream my father would buy. I feel better about eating something that's all natural. The three flavors in one container meant there was always something for everyone
--------------------
This isn’t my favorite flavor of ice cream, but I still like it. I find myself using the strawberry section the least. However, each flavor tastes good both on its own and together. I probably would only buy it again if I was really craving it or needed all three flavors together for something.
--------------------
Delicious. Smooth. Great for any weather. Could be more affordable. Enjoyable for the whole family.
--------------------
This is my go to for birthday parties and other gatherings involving cake and ice cream at my house. You can’t go wrong with traditional Neapolitan ice cream as it has a little something for everyone. I especially like this because of the strawberry ice cream; I love it, but my family could take it or leave it. By having the other options, I don’t have to feel guilty about buying a whole half gallon of the same flavor. Breyer’s products are creamy and are made from natural ingredients, so the flavor can’t be beat!
--------------------
This sugar free ice cream really impressed me! I thought the vanilla and chocolate had good flavor but the strawberry was a little lacking. It tasted much more artificial and there were no chunks as pictured on the container. But all in all still a yummy, guilt free treat!
--------------------
I buy this one often. The flavors are rich and flavorful. This often disappears in my house
--------------------
Has the three most basic flavors so if you’re in the mood for all three this is perfect!
--------------------
I love the creamy texture of Breyers ice cream. It doesn’t get too hard in the freezer like most other brands. The flavors always taste fresh and natural. I love that there are pieces of strawberries in the ice cream, the chocolate is nice and rich and the vanilla is perfectly vanilla!
--------------------
Such a good tasting ice cream I love to have this one and make banana splits and get all 3 flavors in it my kids love it as well null
--------------------
Up until recently I haven't had any ice cream and it made me realize how much I missed it. This is a classic combination that is absolutely delicous.
--------------------
I know not many people like neopolatain icecream but I really like this companies icecream. I'm an icecream junkie just like any girl and idk who doesn't want all of the best flavors in one box. I would recommend this to anyone it's the best
--------------------
This is my wife's favorite flavor. I personally dig for the vanilla, because it tastes amazing.
--------------------
I swear by Breyers ice cream, and I always will. Their Neapolitan is a great take on the classic. The strawberry pieces next to the chocolate makes you think you’re eating a frozen chocolate covered strawberry. It’s the best. Hands down. Look no further, literally.
--------------------
Neapolitan is the way to go, because you don’t have to choose your flavour! This is a quality brand.
--------------------
Fresh natural flavors. A trio of flavors that my whole family can enjoy. Doesn't last long in my house , maybe two nights of that.
--------------------
I love this your getting a 3 in 1 for basically the price of 1 I don’t like chocolate ice cream so I mostly eat around it
--------------------
I grew up on this. My parents always kept a container of the Neopolitan in the freezer. As good as it’s always been
--------------------
Not a huge fan of chocolate but strawberry is always so yummy especially with some chocolate syrup!!!
--------------------
I love eating this its so amazing and tastes so good and great i love it so much and its so amazing i cannot believe it that its so good
--------------------
This icecream is pretty good, but recently I have noticed that the flavor tastes kind of watered down compared to other icecream flavors. It’s not my favorite brand of icecream, but it’s cheap which is always nice.
--------------------
So good! High quality ingredients and it tastes like it. It’s a pretty good price for what you get.
--------------------
Vanilla chocolate strawberry is a classic and pretty much all my mom bought when I was growing up. I’ve eaten Breyers for years and will continue eating it. It’s creamy and delicious ... plus, it’s affordable.
--------------------
My husband and kids love the neopolitan ice cream. It’s great for the price and taste delicious
--------------------
I use this annually for my 4th of July Ice cream eating contest. I like that I can get all three flavors in one container, the flavors remain rich, and they don’t run into one another.
--------------------
Just saying, this is super inexpensive, you can buy at walmart or kroger, tastes amazing and i am a repeat consumer. i would recommend to everyone to at least just try this ice cream because it tastes amazing for a very affordable price.
--------------------
This ice cream is great. My family can never agree on a flavour so this way everyone gets the flavour they want. I buy this often.
--------------------
I love breyers ice-cream but I didn’t really like the chocolate flavor in this combo. The other two flavors were good though especially the strawberry. I recommend if you want to have more flavors at one time.
--------------------
This ice cream is so good! I love it. It isnt too expensive and tastes great. They flavours are not overpowering either.
--------------------
Not as rich as the full sugar ice cream but a heck of a lot healthier. I like to keep a tub in hand because I have a few friends who are trying to cut back on sugar. That being said, it’s way better than some of the other low sugar ice creams I’ve tried. Strong flavors and creamy mouthfeel.
--------------------
A classic! Can’t go wrong with this one. Plus, it’s sugar free - not bad for diabetics! Very creamy. Made for a great dessert.
--------------------
I absolutely love the whole trio type ice cream thing where you get more than one flavor I just really don't like the no sugar added because it kills out the flavor but I guess that's why most healthy things do
--------------------
If your craving super rich chocolatey brownies, this will hit the spot. We had it with the waffle cone and it was great.
--------------------
I was shocked by how good this tasted. The fudge and chocolate brownie in here is amazing. It is chewy and delicious. The chocolate ice cream doesnt taste cheap which i was really pleasantly surprised about!
--------------------
I tried this ice cream for the first time recently and I fell in love with it. Brownies and chocolate ice cream? The combo I didn’t know I needed, the chocolate flavored ice cream has a soft texture to it. Absolutely love it.
--------------------
This is stellar. The brownie pieces have the perfect amount of chewiness, and I haven't had the brownie-quantity issues that other people have. The chocolate ice cream base is great, and it's all around a excellent purchase.
--------------------
There is no brownie in the ice cream, so there is no difference between purchasing chocolate ice cream and this ice cream. The only reason why I selected two-star is chocolate tastes good, but it is still very disappointing.
--------------------
I was so happy to this see this on the shelf BUT got disappointed after trying it. There weren’t enough swirls of fudge & brownies. I feel like I was eating a regular chocolate ice cream. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I spotted a fudge and a brownie. This shouldn’t be called Chocolate Fudge Brownie if it doesn’t contain enough fudge and brownies.
--------------------
If you're looking for something like Ben & Jerrys, this is not it. Theres little to no pieces of brownie (which is my favorite part of Ben & Jerrys). The chocolate flavor is really good though & its really soft & easy to serve, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. I probably wouldn't get it again, but I won't have a problem finishing it while I have it.
--------------------
It’s sold for just 1$ at target near my home. Literally free! The taste is good as well
--------------------
The good thing about this is that the taste is alright. It's not the best chocolate, but it's not terrible. The brownie pieces are also good. The bad? The texture is terrible. It's like they whipped so much air into it, it's like a creamy soft serve. It's no wonder why this ice cream is so cheap. It's like it's half melted all the time. Spend the extra $2 and splurge on something a little better like Breyer's.
--------------------
A great flavor but limited availability; Raleigh Central rarely has it,but I can always count on Raleigh NE to have it in stock always.
--------------------
Excellent rich and chocolatey flavor. Great Target brad price! Only problem, the Minneapolis downtown store where I shop is almost always out of stock!
--------------------
Really good ice cream sandwiches. I really love how they’re wrapped in paper instead of plastic.
--------------------
These are by far our favorite ice cream sandwiches. They are better than Bluebell. the chocolate cookie is soft and delicious.
--------------------
Puny product with excessively dry/tough wafers and very little (and nearly flavorless) ice cream. Truly awful.
--------------------
I love these ice cream sandwiches, it’s hard to just eat one!
--------------------
Just such a great small ice cream treat Love it.
--------------------
I love these things. The only issue I have is that after you eat one, you want to eat the whole box.
--------------------
We have enjoyed these for some time now as a little refreshing treat.  The item wrap doesn't stick to the sandwich like others do so no sticky wafer fingers.  It's a tad smaller that other brands but a nice flavor.  You can't beat the price for 12 either.  We buy often as it's consistent in taste and quality.  Don't expect it to be the same as the high dollar brands but the kids love them!!
--------------------
Normally I would give this a 5-star rating but this time I must rate it with 1-star. The Ice Cream Sandwich had a sticky residue on six of the twelve ice cream sandwiches, I like this brand better than the bluebell ice cream sandwiches but these are a little soft. I would purchase this brand again but I WIll definitely try other brands before purchasing this brand again. The main reason why I'm very disappointed is because I had to throw out half of the box.
--------------------
Absolutely disgusting. The entire thing had no flavor. I usually buy the all chocolate ones and they are amazing but the vanilla tastes like the fakest food I’ve ever eaten. I couldn’t even finish one bite
--------------------
I have purchased store brand ice cream sandwiches at other stores but they use "Frozen Dessert." I was happily surprised to see that Target uses actual ice cream for their sandwiches. Plus they are so good.
--------------------
Absolutely the best ice cream! Definitely must try!
--------------------
This ice cream has become a staple at my house. It's surprisingly creamy for a grocery store brand. I don't usually like plain vanilla (life's too short!), but I like this ice cream.
--------------------
Nice taste and texture.  I give this product 4 stars because it has high fructose corn syrup or else I would have given it 5 stars based on my opinion of this French Vanilla not being "eggy" as some others that I have tasted in the past.

Anyway, for the price it is definitely worth trying it.
--------------------
Taste a lot like homemade! You can taste the cream
--------------------
We go without ice cream if we can't find this one in stock, it's that good! Please Target, stock up on our favorite ice cream.
--------------------
I always judge a brand by their ability to make vanilla ice cream. If a brand can't put out a decent vanilla ice cream, none of their other flavors are worth trying. Target's store brand ice cream is honesty one of the better ones out there. Only at $3 a pop, I decided to bring one home. I hate to admit it but I finished the entire carton in two days. Two days! I was pleasantly surprise on how creamy it was. This French vanilla is a great base for your ice cream sundae. Although it goes great with chocolate syrup and sprinkles, I like it by itself because it's that flavorful. Don't be discouraged by the cheap price tag. You're getting more than what you pay for.
--------------------
I expected a lime colored tangy fruit bar. I got a creamy white overly sweet limeade bar.
--------------------
This is by far the only fruit snack my children will agree on. Each has favorite fruit in one box so it never goes wasted. During the covid shortage it was struggle to locate it in the stores but we went long distances just to get our hands on one box. The flavor is amazing. Raspberry is sometimes too sweet or too sour and this has the perfect balance. We have been using it for years I have not heard a complaint from my daughter (very picky). Highly recommend it.
--------------------
Me and my teens love these. The flavors are amazing. Good strong flavors without tasting artificial. Sugar comes from cane sugar.  Nothing artificial. Perfect size. My favorite is the lime, but they are all delicious and refreshing.
--------------------
Great for a treat. Taste great and not too many calories.
--------------------
I absolutely love this variety of fruit bar flavors. They taste like real fruit and not artificial flavoring. The lime flavor is especially delicous!
--------------------
I’m 62, play around of golf and then polish off anywhere from 4-6 of these and I’m comply refreshed and my thirst is quenched. Sorry it took so long for me to find em
--------------------
Packed full of juicy flavor, but there are no jokes on the sticks so I had to deduct a star.
--------------------
I’m hooked! I had an ice cream addiction that I needed to break, so after reading so many labels in the frozen foods department that I raised an eyebrow from the staff at my local supermarket, I grabbed a box of Outshine Strawberry, Lime and Raspberry bars. Oh my goodness, they’re incredible! No “diet taste”, no artificial anything - just good food that tastes great! My favorites were the lime and raspberry. I’m on to my next box, which is even better; Dark Chocolate Raspberry. Yum! I can’t wait to try all your flavors! Thanks so much for making these incredible bars!
--------------------
My freezer is never without them...ever! There isn’t a flavor I don’t like, and I’ve tried them ALL!!!! Yum ❤️
--------------------
I've tried alot of fruit popsciles but these have been the best I've tasted so far. They are cooling and refreshing. I could eat the whole box if I don't pay attention
--------------------
I fell in love with the Outshine Pineapple bars! The bits of fruit and smooth texture is amazing. I decided I wanted to try other flavors so I thought that the Strawberry, Lime, Raspberry mix pack would be a great way to do it. I noticed in store that the variety pack was a different shape (thinner) but I didn’t think anything of it. At home I tried the popsicles, and the variety pack although flavorful does not have the wonderful texture and intense real fruit experience. They are very good popsicles but they don’t live up to the frozen fruit bar experience I received with the pineapple.
--------------------
We tried these once in the store. Today my husband went up to grab some since my throat hurt. Basically half the box is gone. Flavor is very rich! I don’t know why we haven’t bought before now.
--------------------
This brand of fruit pops have always been my favorite! I usually can’t just have 1, lime and strawberry are my favorite but the raspberry is also very good! My 6 yr old luvs them, she would eat the whole box if I let her lol! I would like to try the fruit/veggie pops next, I’m sure they’re great the strawberry cream pops are my favorite as well!!
--------------------
I love these fruit bars. This is my year round go to snack....
--------------------
These bars tastes delicious. I couldn't believe how good they are as well. Tastes like a smoothie on a stick. My favorite flavor was strawberry and it has real fruit pieces in it too. A great idea for a quick snack that's good for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------

These fruit bars are really great. You can actually taste the fruit in them . Each flavor tastes exactly like it's supposed to. And it's all natural. I enjoyed all of the flavor options so I really didn't have a favorite one. I've decided to try other products from this brand as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
These bars are delicious. They make the perfect snack for after school or for yourself. My kids and I are so in love with them. They are made with real fruit juices. Much better for your family too. So good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I honestly couldn't remember the last time I had a popsicle - but once I saw these, I had to have them! Sure, they're not a chocolate pop but when you're in the need for a refreshing, cool treat that won't make you feel totally guilty (real fruit!) these totally hit the spot! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My family has always enjoyed the Strawberry, Raspberry & Lime fruit bars. This recent box we got had a nice surprise. The lime bars had a small bit of the other's mixed in. I can't tell if it's the strawberry or raspberry, but it was amazing. If the idea hasn't already been tested I would recommend it. Lime and berry was a big hit with everyone in my family. (No sugar free, though. We can't handle the sorbitol stuff)
--------------------
I bought these as a quick and healthy snack for my family. We all love them! Raspberry is my favorite, my son loves the lime and my daughter loves the strawberry. So the whole box is gone in no time. These Outshine bars are the perfect summer time snack, cool and refreshing! I would definitely recommend them!
--------------------
I was looking for a dairy free summer treat and came upon the Outburst popsicles. My husband and I have been going through boxes of these wonderfully flavored treats!
--------------------

I bought a couple of boxes of these a month ago and I'm so glad I did; My kids absolutely love these Outshine fruit bars, especially the lime flavor. They are very tasty and they keep my family happy and cool during the summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
It's summer time in Texas, which means it is plenty HOT! This is why I decided to give these fruit bars a try and I am glad that I did. The best way to describe them is that they are like REAL frozen fruit sticks. They are made with no corn syrup and with no artificial colors, but are sweet and flavorful! My kids love them too, which is amazing considering that they are fat free, gluten free, and GMO free! -Cant wait to taste the other flavors! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
These had such a delicious and not too sweet taste! I will definitely be buying these all summer long! They did not have that icy effect that sometime popcicles have and they were not too sweet. I loved that they were made with real fruit and juice and they will be a staple in my house. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I absolutely LOVE these fruit bars! Not only are they a guilt free summer refresher, but I also use them in my smoothies for nice burst of fruit flavor.

first off these things are great. They are in my top 3 of summertime treats and are worth the buy. Strawberry, Lime and Raspberry flavors are all in one pack so you have a little bit of variety. My boy (age 9) and I like sitting on our back porch in the summertime evening and just relaxing. I highly recommend these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Outshine fruit bars are a great hit with my family. We loved that one box had 3 different flavors (Strawberry, Lime & Raspberry) that everyone loved. This will be a product we will purchase again as it is made with fruit juice and not concentrated juices making it too sweet in flavor. The bars was a perfect size to have as a after dinner treat.

These are the best fruit bars I have ever had. They are so refreshing and flavorful it's like you are eating fresh fruit right out of your hand. They stayed frozen while eating them and not falling off the stick into your hand. Very good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I will continue to purchase these. This is now a brand that I will continue to get as far as popsicles. I love the ingredients. The flavors are great and honestly I wasn't sure how they were going to taste due to the fact that one of the ones that I got were fruit and vegetables. I was able to taste a little bit of veggies in there but the fruit was what they focused on more when it came to The Taste which was really great for my kids. They are usually very picky when it comes to something that might taste like a vegetable if it is something that is supposed to be considered a treat or something that to them is candy. They really love these popsicles. The thing that I loved the most about these were not just the ingredients but the fact that they are so easy to bite into. I hate how the traditional popsicles feel like they are going to break your teeth and I am very big on taking care of my teeth as far as my children's as well. I really loved the Outshine popsicles and I can't wait tilo see what else they have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Outshine fruit bars have such great flavor. I absolutely love all of the flavors they are sweet and refreshing, but not too sweet like some other fruit bars nor do they taste watered down.

--------------------
I've never had these fruit bars before and I was pleasantly surprised how great these tasted! I got the variety box so I could try more than one flavor to see how I liked them and I could honestly say they're amazing! They're just perfect on a hot summer day when you crave something cold and sweet rather than just a simple glass of tea or lemonade. These bars give you that pucker that lemonade does and have you cooling down in no time! What makes these bars even better is that they're only 35-45 calories per bar!! Can anyone say guilt free? Not only that these bars are gluten free, no artificial flavors, and made with real fruit juices! Out of all I'd have to say the raspberry one is by far my favorite. I'm defiantly going to try out the other bars they have on the market and see how they are. It's also good to note that they have no sugar added options for their bars as well as fruit and yogurt bars! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
