My kid LOVE this apple juice! It is the only one we buy when it comes to juice boxes.
--------------------
Love this cranberry blend cocktail. In this time of COVID, it’s great to have a sophisticated adult drink that is non alcoholic. I blend with some market pantry sparkling water, a couple slices of lime, a few drops of butter and serve over ice. Just L O V E it!
--------------------
We love it. Every bit as good as MUCH higher priced name brands. Great crisp taste, great price. We buy it every week and plan to continue.
--------------------
This stuff simply doesn't have the cranberry tang... doesn't taste like cranberry juice or cranberry coctail. Just red juice, with that slightly fakey sucralose taste. 

I had hoped that this would have enough cranberry juice in it to have that nice sour bitter cranberry tang. But it doesn't. Can't recommend this juice and sorry I ordered a half-dozen of them.
--------------------
amazing with only 5 calories and smooth tasting
--------------------
I love the Simply Brand and this orange juice is delicious and perfect with its little extra calcium. No improvement necessary. Its perfect.
--------------------
I love the Simply Brand and this orange juice is delicious and perfect with its little extra calcium. No improvement necessary. It’s perfect.
--------------------
Really good my bf’s go to orange juice
--------------------
Tastes really good. I get the large containers because I can drink this within a week. I love any of the simply flavors.
--------------------
The BEST oj. It tastes freshly squeezed and has that sweetness that just feels like it's straight from the orange.
--------------------
Omg living in Florida I can definitely say this is one of the best orange juice brands out there. It is a great add to your breakfast it’s healthy and delicious. This is one of our everyday breakfast drinks
--------------------
I love this juice. I drink it almost everyday!
--------------------
Nothing better than this for flavor! It doesn’t have that gross metallic aftertaste. Tastes like fresh squeezed but without the pulp!
--------------------
My favorite kind of orange juice. Glad they have branched our into so many other flavors and products
--------------------
I have smoothies almost daily and love to add a little bit of orange juice to the mixture and most of the time I will add half water half juice for the amount I need to make my glass of smoothie during the day and put in my nutrabullet or my shaker bottle if I need it quick.
--------------------
This is thr best orange juice we have tried. I like that it has no high fructose corn syrup and is pulp free. Even more exciting is that it has added calcium. This is important for someone with lactose intolerance. Be sure to shake the bottle first.
--------------------
This is a juice my whole family loves. Packed with lots of vitamins! This is great for both kids and adults! It’s taste great while helping to keep your immune system and body healthy and strong!
--------------------
Simply oranges always have good, Refreshing taste I really recommend this juice also has Vitamin D
--------------------
I really like Simply brand juices. They have a refreshing taste and good flavors. Recommend buying them all!
--------------------
I would rate this orange juice as four stars because I usually dilute this juice with some water so lessen the taste of sugar or sweetness. For others this might be a good juice and I think it is, because it does taste good but I think it can taste less artificial. I at times drink naturally squeezed orange juice and it does not compare.
--------------------
This is really the only juice I like to buy. I hate the taste of juices from concentrate, and Simply Orange is not from concentrate. Will continue to purchase regularly.
--------------------
Don’t let your money go to waste. Word everevetf was a great day for my birthday and my ￼
--------------------
I really like this orange juice! It’s very yummy! I prefer the kind with pulp, but both are good.
--------------------
I love this brand of orange juice and it’s an added benefit to have some extra vitamins besides just your vitamin C :) I also love that they use more of the natural ingredients and less sugar...win for my family!
--------------------
This is the orange juice I use for my mimosas! It’s a great orange juice. It has a much smoother flavor than the other orange juices and you can tell it’s a lot fresher and more natural. This is the only orange juice that we buy in my house.
--------------------
My go to orange juice! So delicious and they offer so many different kinds. Good with champagne or just for a glass of OJ with breakfast.
--------------------
I buy this regularly for my daughter who is allergic to milk. This is my favorite orange juice in terms of how fresh it tastes. I also like the bottle- it’s convenient. I do find it to be higher priced than other juices.
--------------------
Probably my favorite orange juice brand. It doesn’t seem to be too sugary at all. I love blending it into smoothies as well. Definitely recommend
--------------------
this orange juice is great. it has absolutely no pulp. it is a very good value for the price. there are no improvements i would make. i am a repeat consumer.
--------------------
This is the only orange juice brand we buy. My husband loves orange juice and asks for it by name (or he will grab it on his own and put it into the basket).
--------------------
I have been wanting a lot of OJ recently an this is the one i always drink. Good taste and bite to it
--------------------
My favorite orange juice. Tastes the closest to fresh squeezed. By far the favorite in my household
--------------------
This is my favorite orange juice and I think it has the most consistent taste of all the orange juices on the market. I don't drink a whole lot of orange juice but when I do I will definitely always get this brand
--------------------
Husband drinks this nonstop, we have it for breakfast all the time. Great taste and refreshing!
--------------------
This drink is truly a releasing classic for any person of any age. It isn’t too sweet not to bland, it seems to be just right :). If the recommended serving size of wash ingredient isn’t right for you then it is easily adjustable :)
--------------------
I feel like this is such a natural drink for me for some reason. I enjoy drinking this beverage.
--------------------
I really love orange juice with calcium in it! I don’t drink a lot of milk, and let’s be real calcium supplements always taste gross. This is a really easy way to get my calcium in. I typically use it as a base for protein smoothies after the gym and I really love it. Not too sweet and no gross calcium taste.
--------------------
My favorite orange juice to purchase! I like that there is a lower sugar count, but still satisfying.
--------------------
Not a fan of pulp to be completely honest! The simply orange no pulp juice taste so good! Perfect drink to pair with breakfast and even lunch. Price is usually not too bad for the taste. Will purchase again.
--------------------
Sweet, tasty drink! Pairs well with breakfast food! Smooth, orange taste! Best when fully chilled!
--------------------
We buy this juice all the time. It is absolutely delicious. Makes you feel healthy and like you are getting your full dosage of vitamin C!
--------------------
Great orange juice!!! I love it!!! It has a great flavor and it tastes amazing!!!!!!!!!
--------------------
This is the best juice anyone could ever have. Repeat consumer who’s had this multiple times. I wouldn’t change anything because they have one with pulp and one pulp free. I would buy again and have!
--------------------
The first brand of juice to realize that the best flavor is natural. Sugar just dilutes the taste. And the goodness of oranges doesn’t need to be diluted or drowned in sugar.
--------------------
This is the best orange juice. Especially with breakfast it quenches that morning thirst like no other. Orange juice with any breakfast food is the best combination ever to exist, in my opinion. Simply orange is the best
--------------------
My go to orange juice we drink orange juice almost everyday but mainly when I’m getting sick or is sick so it can give me all the vitamin C that I need in my body
--------------------
This is one of my favorite orange juices! It tastes very natural. I love all the different flavors!
--------------------
This is literally the orange juice I will drink. Others just dont compare. This brand is just so smooth and has a real orange taste. Some other brands are thick and syrupy textured and almost make you more thirsty than you were before. Dare i say it thise other brands are like tang. This is the Rolls Royce of orange juice.
--------------------
This is the best orange juice around! The taste is the best, not too tart or tangy, doesn’t upset my stomach like others do.
--------------------
I love the dimple and fresh taste of this juice. And it is priced perfect and easy to find on the shelf
--------------------
Got this to try since my other orange juice hasn’t been instores and very picky with orange juice lol. It smells and taste like orange flavor. wasn’t terrible of taste.very refreshing in the morning.
--------------------
This tastes so good! And truly has no pulp, I buy the individual size ones alll the time! I’m on a seizure medication and a side effect is tingling in my hands, my doctor said to drink orange juice, Gatorade and eat bananas to help this side effect and as long as I drink some of this no tingling!!!
--------------------
I feel like this juice tastes as close to fresh squeezed orange juice that you can get from a store! We also like that is not from concentrate. This is the only brand we buy now.
--------------------
Love the Simply brand, there juices are amazing. They taste great and of high quality. They are refreshing and just hit the right spot. Its my go to when it comes to juices as I dont feel any other juice brand really tops Simply.
--------------------
I can’t stand pulp! This is a very tasty orange juice and the fact it’s pulp free makes it my fave OJ.
--------------------
Best orange juice ever!! Always have it in our fridge at all times! Love this orange juice:
--------------------
This is the best orange juice on the market. I don't like pulp at all, so I really appreciate the pulp free choice.
--------------------
I LOVE the simply juices, lemonade is my favorite. I love how fresh it tastes and how you taste real fruit in the drink. My go to when I am sick!
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite orange juice! It’s available at a variety of retailers & the flavor is really good! It’s a breakfast staple.
--------------------
Smooth yummy orange juice. One of my favorites. Goes down smooth without that bitter orange taste some inferior orange juices can have. Love the no pulp, I don't care for bits of floating stiff in my drinks so this is perfect!
--------------------
I drink this every day because it's the best orange juice on the market!! It's a little more expensive than other orange juices, but the taste is worth it. And I never get sick!!
--------------------
THIS IS MY FAVORITE ORANGE JUICE! I am an orange juice fanatic and nothing beats simply orange. We buy this at our office just for a nice drink and it’s a great mixer for mimosas because of the great taste. I love this juice and it’s so good it’s in my fridge right now!
--------------------
My favorite orange juice it’s the only one I’ll buy and drink it’s the perfect flavor
--------------------
Just great tasting orange juice. Can’t really go wrong there! It’s truly pulp free and I enjoy it.
--------------------
Love this orange juice. It is my absolute favorite. I definitely recommend it! It is very affordable. The taste is tangy, unlike some other orange juice brands.
--------------------
My husband loves this juice, it's the only one he'll drink. I prefer a low acid version myself. This one does however have a great taste that is very fresh. He loves to drink it while snacking on dry special k serial. It also makes a great mimosas for brunch time.
--------------------
This is my favorite store brand orange juice I’ve tried. Great for making mimosas too!
--------------------
This is my go to brand of orange juice. Good flavor and additional nutrients that my body needs. I’ll continue to buy this and would recommend.
--------------------
This is my all-time favorite orange juice. I think I drink this orange juice at least 2 to 3 times a day. There’s nothing that I would improve about this product it’s so delicious. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the price is very affordable I also like how it has no pulp in it and it gives me the calcium and vitamin D that I need.￼
--------------------
I drink orange juice daily because I over produce in my breastmilk! The calcium in this orange juice help make my bones stronger .
--------------------
Some orange juice tends not to agree with me stomach but Simply orange juice doesn’t bother me. I love this juice the taste is great I also love their Raspberry lemonade flavored drink! I highly recommend this for juice lovers
--------------------
Out of all of the juices I really like this one the most. Pulp free, smooth, and packed with vitamins. It’s not very expensive and the flavor is good. I would definitely buy it again and keep it on hand!
--------------------
my favorite brand of orange juice it’s delicious and the low acid helps with my reflux￼
--------------------
I love orange juice in general, so it’s no surprise this is one of my favorites. I wish it wasn’t as sweet, but I find it’s hard to find an orange juice with low sugar because oranges are just sweet! Lol. Good beverage
--------------------
A great type of orange juice and it isn’t too acidic and not too sweet. Right in the middle for a refreshing breakfast drink.
--------------------
This is the best tasting freshest juice I have ever tasted. I grab this juice anytime I can. Tastes just like you pulled the orange right off the tree
--------------------
Best orange juice out there. I trust the brand and the ingredients. I never look else where when buying juice
--------------------
Simply Orange Juice is my all time Fav OJ. Love the added calcium and Vitamin D. It doesn’t change the flavor but I know it’s great giving it to the kids!
--------------------
I am a huge lover orange juice. I am likely one of few who love the pulp. I like this Simply orange as it has added calcium and vitamin d. I don't mind the lack if pulp. Very smooth. Makes a great base for adult cocktails as well.
--------------------
When trying to find a juice that I felt confident in giving my son, I looked at so many ingredient lists on different brands. Simply juices are just that... Simply. Juice. No additives or questionable ingredients, and of course they taste great. My son drinks some everyday! The peach flavor of good favorite, but he seems to love them all
--------------------
The best is made even better with added calcium and vitamin D. Doesn’t change the taste at all, so the kids never notice.
--------------------
Love Simply Orange. Actually love the flavors. Great value. Like that you can get it with pulp or not. The single serves are perfect for traveling or with little ones. Highly recommend Simply beverages!! Try them all - you won’t be disappointed!
--------------------
Simply orange juice is the best. I always keep it stocked in the refrigerator and it is perfect for a nice glass every morning.
--------------------
Im not personally an orange juice drinker but my kids love this brand of juice over man juice brands
--------------------
I absolutely loved orange juice. ive tried other brands but this one has to be my favorite. it doesnt last in my house with my 3 kids and husband. we have to buy like 3 at a time n that only lasts a few days.
--------------------
This is always in our fridge. Between the Tiny Human and the diabetic boyfriend we trust it and the taste is great!
--------------------
This is fine, but I much prefer orange juice with pulp instead of pulp free. If you like pulp free, go with this juice. It’s nice that it had the extra calcium and vitamin D.
--------------------
The only orange juice I'll buy. Love pulp too. Im a fruit personal and oj is my good too juice. Plus you dont get that cardboard taste.
--------------------
I love simple orange! They have great juices for oranges and watermelon! This one is personally one of my favorites because it provides calcium and vitamin D on top of the vitamin C that you already get from orange juice! Also I love that it doesn’t have pulp! I 100% recommend this product!
--------------------
Love this product. It has a wonderful taste and the design of the bottle is great. I buy this OJ frequently.
--------------------
This is the only orange juice I drink. Delicious, theres nothing like it. non GMOs and I highly recommend.
--------------------
Great oj choice for the family. Always has a great taste, at a great price. Love to mix it with my green powder to start the day right.
--------------------
Love the added calcium and vitamin D. Simply orange juice is a weekly staple at our house.
--------------------
By far my favorite orange juice. Nice and sweet and not tangy, which is perfect for my California self. I always like to buy this brand, especially getting the medium pulp. I enjoy pulp in my orange juice, reminds of homemade OJ. The price is reasonable and in most stores you can catch a sale.
--------------------
Good for not super fresh orange juice. Right amount of pulp but you can choose the amount you want from the brand. Not the concentrated taste like other brands.
--------------------
Fresh squished, fresh as the day they were born. This is the only orange juice I ever want to buy, and having vitamins added is just a (tasteless!). Has the best, non-concentrated flavor I’ve ever had, and anything less is just settling. TBH.
--------------------
Love this orange juice!! 5 stars!! It has a great flavor and I love it with the pulp. Fresh taste!! Highly recommend this brand!!
--------------------
This is actually the only orange juice I will buy. I’ve tried others but this is the one I keep coming back to. I love that it has calcium and vitamin D. I prefer pulp free. And it’s super yummy and smooth. Doesn’t taste fake or chalky like other brands.
--------------------
I drink a glass of this every single morning when eating breakfast. It’s a good start to the day, giving you a few simple vitamins and thing that you need since it also has calcium in it. As someone who can’t drink milk, I enjoy having a product that I know has a key thing I need in it.
--------------------
Best tasting store-bought orange juice! Doesn’t taste fake like some of the cheap orange juices that have additional sugars and are watered down. I also love how they added vitamin D to the juice! And it’s a good price point for the product you get!
--------------------
Love this orange juice. All natural and delicious. A little pricey but very worth it.
--------------------
I grab this one when my bf doesn’t want high pulp and we will compromise on this. It is the perfect amount of pulp for mimosas where it’s not annoying but still tastes great!
--------------------
So delicious ! One of my favorite for sure !!!!! Love this for breakfast or a snack. Him
--------------------
I love simply juice and will not buy any other kind of orange juice or orange juice blend. They are great products and there is no bitterness like many of the other brands. I drink this every morning.
--------------------
I absolutely love to enjoy a glass of orange juice with my breakfast and this is my favorite brand to buy. It's absolutely delicious and not too pricy. And I love how this one has added calcium and is also pulp free. I highly recommend this to everyone.
--------------------
Too good! Tastes like fresh lemonade. Can be higher in sugar than the light version but does taste wonderful.
--------------------
I love this lemonade. It is a great mixer for adult beverages as well as to drink alone
--------------------
Healthy and delicious.
--------------------
Tastes delicious without all of the extra sugar! 10/10
--------------------
I bought the light because I thought it would be healthier but it taste so much nastier￼
--------------------
Simply is one of my favorite brands, and target is one of the only places I can find the light version of their lemonades. Such a Score! It’s so good and much healthier compared to other brands. It’s also great with some frozen strawberries or flavored syrup added in. Yum!
--------------------
I love the taste of real lemonade made with fresh lemons and this is the real deal. I like the fact that it is lite and that I do not have to spend hours juicing lemons.
--------------------
Delicious lemon beverage. Super great, not too sweet. Definitely a summer time favorite in my household.
--------------------
I am a huge fan of less calories and this is the best tasting of the light lemonades I have tried.
--------------------
I loved the regular simply lemonade and was very excited to see they came out with a light version. I like the whole Simply line because they taste natural and like the actual fruits, not like artificial flavors. While I like to try and be healthy, I don’t even mean it in that way; I just want the taste of actual lemons or limes, or whatever they claim the juice is that I’m buying. This actually tastes like it’s made from juicy lemons, not something from concentrate and chemicals scientifically made in a dark lab somewhere mixed with what is ultimately 90% water. Hope you love this one too!
--------------------
Low calorie, light tart flavor. Great for summertime drinks and to use as a mixer. We even made popsicles out of it this summer with frozen berries.
--------------------
Tastes good and has less sugar/calories. I love the taste of the regular lemonade but too sugary for me. This is a good alternative
--------------------
I sometimes get the light because the Simply original lemonade is still very sweet. But unlike other brands, it tastes like actual lemonade and not concentrate.
--------------------
so thankful for a full flavor lemonade that is light and refreshing, with less than 1/2 the calories and sugar! love this stuff.
--------------------
This is my husband's favorite lemonade, so we always have it in the fridge. It has a perfect sweet lemon taste. I love that it is lower sugar so my husband (type 1 diabetic) and kids can enjoy it regularly. We will definitely continue purchasing this product.
--------------------
Needed a drink that would not spike my hubby's sugar since he is diebetic. He was tired of only drinking water so this lemonade is an addition to this brands list of drinks with less sugar! Simplytm Light Lemonade at a great price.
--------------------
Love this light version much easier to fit into diet. Nice flavor and a great change of pace compared to the normal water I drink. Good value and quality. I would recommend not watered down flavor like some of the other light lemonades I’ve tried.
--------------------
So delicious. Even though it’s light, it still tastes like that regular summer time favorite drink of lemonade. No weird aftertaste, just delicious. Recommend to anyone for less sugar and healthier but delicious
--------------------
I have to grab one of these when I empty,or a small sized one whenever I am on the go. It may come off at first as lacking flavor/sugar because of course its less sugar.However, once I drank it more I was obsessed. I find that its light enough to eat with foods that pack a punch of flavor. I have tried the original and it was o.k ,but personally I like this one better.
--------------------
I tried simply light lemonade as a low-calorie mixer. I love regular simply lemonade, so I was hoping to have the same experience with the light version. Unfortunately, the artificial sweetener had a very strong flavor and I did not enjoy the product overall.
--------------------
I love a good lemonade. This lemonade is delicious and sweet enough but still light on the calories. If you’re counting calories I would definitely recommend this
--------------------
This is definitely my favorite brand of lemonade and orange juice when I am splurging. I am happy they do a light version that doesn’t taste completely like fake sugar or artificial sweeteners. Great on its own or as a mixer.￼
--------------------
Love this lemonade and it’s better for you than the original. You honestly can’t even tell the difference. I buy this all year round.
--------------------
This light lemonade has a great taste. The perfect amount of sweetness but you don’t have to feel guilty drinking it since it light.
--------------------
I actually ended up liking this one better than the regular lemonade, it made me feel like I was being healthier!
--------------------
I love that Simply has a light lemonade! Perfect for everyday drinking and for a little extra in the champagne!
--------------------
I love this product it is very tasty! And it did meet my expectations, i figured it would be very good and I was right, and it’s very tasty non like other products and I would buy it again ! Very affordable
--------------------
The taste isn’t bad but the sweetness you expect from lemonade isn’t there. Also high acidity will burn your throat. It’s a great mixer for alcohol if you’re on a diet since the tartness will mask the alcohol taste completely
--------------------
I don’t drink much lemonade but I have had this one from Simply. As far as premade lemonades go this one is pretty good. It has good lemon flavor while not being too sweet. It also doesn’t have the junk in it some other brands do.
--------------------
Love Simply light lemonade. This is my go to all summer long. Great taste, low calorie and no fake aftertaste. If you haven’t tried it you should! One of the best out there!
--------------------
Simply lemonade is full of flavour and it’s super delicious. It’s both sour and sweet! When you sip this beverage you feel like it’s summer in your mouth! I recommend this drink to anyone who’s looking for a nice lemonade drink on a hot summer day as it’s very refreshing! I would surely purchase this during the summer.
--------------------
Excellent light refreshing lemonade! Low calorie yet still tasty! Delicious in summer cocktails! Great break from water when doing weight watchers!
--------------------
I love this lemonade because it’s light and refreshing! I’ve bought this product for a long time now! I don’t really have anything bad or improvements on this product! I do recommend this to anybody who want a resting drink!
--------------------
This is our favorite lower sugar lemonade. We tried the powder but this is worth it! I also use this a little squirt of like to make low sugar margs!
--------------------
This is a delicious refreshing beverage and not as much sugar as the regular version. It’s so good!
--------------------
I love it! It's a staple for me in the summer without adding too many extra calories!
--------------------
I love to use this lemonade for my famous lemonade slushie. I use Simply light lemonade, mints leaves and ice!! Delicious on a hot summer day.
--------------------
Love this light version of the simply lemonade. doesn't have a "light" aftertaste like other brands. Great Alone or mixed. I hope they come out with more flavors.
--------------------
Super yummy! This helps me not feel so guilty drinking a sweet drink considering it’s “light”. Moderately priced. Does leave a bit of dry after taste - not always super quenching.
--------------------
If you are watching your carb and sugar intake, the light version of Simply Lemonade is a good option. You'll notice the difference from the regular version but it's still very tasty.
--------------------
This is really good lemonade! If someone were to give me this lemonade, I would have no idea that it was a “light” version. It tastes like regular lemonade, is nice, refreshing, and perfect for summer. Would recommend!
--------------------
Good size for snack for the children. Refreshing sweet lemonade. Its enough for a quick hydrating drink. Again I would just like a less sugar version of this
--------------------
Really refreshing low calorie option for the summer. Great to have around for the kids and adult cocktails. Love the lemonade and keep it in the fridge year round! Reasonably priced but keep refrigerated.
--------------------
I like lemonade on a hot day like anyone else. But what I don’t like is all of the sugar that usually goes in those drinks. I like the light version of this lemonade because it’s zero sugar and a lot less calories for a refreshing drink that still tastes great
--------------------
Sweet but not overly so, it’s delicious... They found the perfect balance of sugar and stevia. I hope they’re working on a strawberry lemonade and limeade! Ooh, cherry limeade?
--------------------
I’m not a huge fan of sweetener/sugary drinks but still enjoy some lemonade on a hot summer day. Once I found simply light lemonade I had to try it and I was a fan! I love how you get that lemonade taste without all the extra sugar. Huge fan!
--------------------
Good for when you want to reduce your sugar intake but for some reason I found a bit of a butter after taste after every sip. May have been due to artificial sweeteners
--------------------
This lemonade is super good!! It’s the perfect combination of sweet and tart, especially for a hot summer day.
--------------------
The best. I buy this lemonade every week almost on schedule. I like tart and tangy lemonade, which this is since it’s a lighter calorie version with less sugar. Two pros in my book
--------------------
I go through a half gallon of this stuff every couple days. The “light” lemonade and “light” raspberry lemonade is DELICIOUS. If you’re someone who doesn’t like super sugary juices, this is for you. It’s a super light, crisp taste. You can’t go wrong.
--------------------
AWESOME lemonade! You can’t beat the taste for light lemonade! I was surprised at how good it tastes considering the reduced sugar and calories, but def like it in place for regular simply lemonade
--------------------
I love this lemonade! I add some Tazos Passion Tea and OMG... it’s delicious. I will continue to purchase.
--------------------
This is the best light but real tasting lemonade on the market. It’s not 100% the same, but it really is as good as it gets. I still love it and buy it for my weight conscious parents. Highly recommend!
--------------------
Love this lemonade! Hardly any sugar and low carbs! Goes great with unsweetened tea! Must have in the summer!
--------------------
Good alternative if you drink “diet” drinks. I personally don’t like my lemonade too sweet so I like this.
--------------------
Usually pair these with some brewed tea for a great Arnie Palmer. Good lemonade taste with just the right amount of tart and sweet. Wish it came in a bigger size for our family picnic's. My go to summer beverage!
--------------------
I love this Lemonade. Has a kind of tart taste and sweet. Makes it taste great. Healthier than regular and less calories
--------------------
The light flavor does have a little of a different taste than regular lemonade, but it is still refreshing on a hot day and worth the fewer calories!
--------------------
This lemonade is great for someone who wants to drink lemonade, but doesn’t not want to drink a lot of calories. It tastes good too!
--------------------
I love this simply light lemonade. It is very refreshing and has great flavor just like regular lemonade.
--------------------
This is sooo good! This is so refreshing. I’m addicted! It Does not taste “light” at all.
--------------------
I love this lemonade! It’s the perfect combination of sweet and tart. I mix everything with it from tea to White Claw and it’s delicious!
--------------------
I didn’t like it. The taste was not good. I felt so sweet. I had to add a lot of water
--------------------
I love this lemonade it’s not too sweet and it’s not too acidic but it’s perfect. Sometimes I’ll cut it with water so that it’s not too strong if I wanted it really light.
--------------------
Lemonade with stevia leaves... disgusting.
If you want to make beverages with less sugar, then don't put any sweeteners.
--------------------
I#if I really want a juice beverage I always reach for a less sugar/calorie alternative. I love the light lemonade by Simply. It’s still tasty and refreshing with less sugar and calories, so I can enjoy the classic summer beverage while being mindful of what I’m drinking.
--------------------
I love that I can get a lemonade at the store that is lighter in sugar, but without the gross fake sugars that cause your body harm. It still tastes great, but is lacking a tiny bit of flavor compared to the normal Simply Lemonade. Great for summer cocktails.
--------------------
Not a big fan of the “light” version of this lemonade. I love the Simply brand, but this tastes like artificial sweetener really bad!
--------------------
This is so good. It tastes much more like real lemonade than other “light” brands. Good value.
--------------------
I find this really refreshing without being too thick or heavy. I enjoy lemonade on those hot summer days and sometimes mix it with iced tea.
--------------------
Simply makes the best lemonade and juices. I like the light because it’s less sweet. The apple or mango are delicious they even do strawberry lemo and ever other fruit mixed with lemo. Try them all very good price is affordable and easy to find in must stores.
--------------------
I prefer the light lemonade as it doesn’t contIn as many sugars! It is a little less strong that the normal but I also prefer that! This is so refreshing & by far the best lemonade!
--------------------
I drink this every single day I put in smoothies it's the best lemonade and because it's a light it just makes it so much better because it's less calories and sugar and you can't taste the difference
--------------------
One of the only low sugar lemonades that doesn’t taste like chemicals. Great with iced tea! Love all the simply light varieties.
--------------------
I don’t like my lemonade too sweet. I still mix water with this as well. It’s refreshing..
--------------------
Was more on the sweet side for me, but the consistency is lighter than the original...
--------------------
This lemonade is sooooo good! My coworker brought it to work and I didn’t think it would be good bc it’s Light, but it’s sooo amazing!
--------------------
I don’t love it. The light variety lacks flavor and seems substantially more sour. My preference is just the original lemonade. I would pass on this one next time.
--------------------
I absolutely love this stuff. The flavor is just out of this world for a light lower calorie lemonade. If you haven't tried it get out there and buy it.
--------------------
I just had this lemonade for date night! It is perfectly sweet! Here a recipe that was delicious: mix in sour patch kids as well as white claw. It is a perfect drink mix that’s not too strong and not too sweet.
--------------------
Love love love the light lemonade!! It’s also great to mix with vodka for a calorie friendly adult beverage.
--------------------
I like to add this to seltzer. It tastes fresh. I like that it isn’t too sweet. It’s very refreshing and low calorie.
--------------------
I recently tried the light version of one of my favorite lemonades. I was completely shocked by how similar it tasted to the original. It may be light, but it still has a strong lemonade taste and will certainly be my new go-to.
--------------------
These bottles are always a little pricey but very worth it for he quality in taste! Being a little cheaper would be great but for here and then I always choose this to go drink. I recommend this product to those who want a drink that tastes good!
--------------------
I really enjoy this lemonade. It’s hard to find a low sugar lemonade that doesn’t have an overpowering taste of artificial sweeteners. Simply Light tastes great while still being low in sugar.
--------------------
This lemonade is so good it taste fresh and is healthy! It met all my expectations and have no way of improving it the little bottles make it more convenient to take on the go and I’ll definitely buy it again
--------------------
Love the light lemonade option. I use it to make a starbucks medicine ball dupe. I love that it is less sugar so I don't feel guilty about it but it is still plenty sweet. It's also all natural which makes it so much better.
--------------------
I’ve always liked lemonade, but hated the amount of sugar. This product from Simply helps with some of that concern, without losing any of the taste. Great over ice and I like to add cherries or raspberries for an extra treat.
--------------------
I love lemonade but I also love to watch my sugar and I love that this is low in calories and sugar content. Seriously the best when I have a craving for something sweet
--------------------
Love the simply light lemonade. It has great lemon flavor without all the sugar & extra calories. It’s so light & refreshing!
--------------------
This is great lemonade. We bought this to make Starbucks medicine balls at home! It’s a very nice lemon flavor and very tasty!
--------------------
Love this lemonade! I find even the light version a little too sweet so i usually mix half water with half juice, this reduces the calories and sugar even more and still tastes great. Something we always buy!
--------------------
This is really good lemonade that you don’t have to feel too guilty about. I try to always pay attention to the sugar contents in beverages because they can sneak up on you and this is a good option for when you want something other than water! The taste is also still good and doesn’t taste like a “diet” lemonade.
--------------------
Love this lemonade. Tastes great, price is right and best price on f all is lower in calories!!
--------------------
The best lemonade without all the sugar! So tasty and refreshing. My husband and I love to use it for Tito’s and lemonade which is our go to adult beverage for the summertime. Simply definitely makes the best juices on the market, I would highly recommend any of their juices to anyone.
--------------------
This was not tasty, at all. It was watery and had a funny aftertaste. Surprising and disappointing, as I like their orange juice.
--------------------
This is a staple in our refrigerator. It is refreshing but not loaded wuth calories to still quench your thirst,
--------------------
I love it and I also appreciate that the company has created a lower sugar version which is the Achilles heel of all great lemonade.
--------------------
Tastes so good, and I love that there is a light version. Nice and refreshing. Like to mix this with passion tea!
--------------------
Please go buy this and forget about any other brand you’ve tried! This is a low calorie lemonade but it contains no aspartame (hallelujah) and is sweetened with stevia! So so good!
--------------------
i always get this when i run out of it. this lemonade is immaculate. the taste is amazing and its my favorite drink.
--------------------
Too good! Tastes like fresh lemonade. Can be higher in sugar than the light version but does taste wonderful.
--------------------
Love this lemonade so much along with all of Simply brand products. So fresh and full of flavor!
--------------------
This is my sons favorite drink. Its pure lemonade not from concentrate and I dont have to worry about all these additives Im giving him. He says every fisherman like himself will enjoy it because its good!
--------------------
This is my families favorite flavor of lemonade! It is so yummy and both tart and sweet
--------------------
I love all the Simply products I've tried! They are so refreshing and work great as mixers. For me they're a little on the pricey side, but worth it! The flavor is amazing, but I wish the raspberry was stronger in the raspberry lemonade. I would definitely recommend to others!
--------------------
Perfect combination with summer while ur laying down by the pool. This summer was how I spent it thanks Covid-19
--------------------
This lemonade has tons of flavor, my boyfriend can’t drink all lemonade he gets headaches from artificial sweeteners, and this one is the only one he can drink it’s flavorful and all natural!!!
--------------------
I love the Simply Lemonade brand, I definitely feel like their lemonade is the freshest tasting! I’ve tried a ton of flavors & this is definitely my favorite one!
--------------------
I usually love anything added with raspberry but the lemonade over powered the raspberry flavoring I give this a 3/5 just because I thought it would be better still pretty yummy
--------------------
A good drink, and alternative to soda with a different kick. Great sweet flavor, perfect chilled. Good to drink with meals and alone. Long time customer, I recommend.
--------------------
I buy this juice probably once every 2 weeks and it is usually gone within a few days. I love the sweetness to it and the price is good. Everyone in my house likes it as well although I probably drink it the most! I would recommend it to others!
--------------------
This is a special treat on a hot summer day—we had so many this summer! When I do not want to take the time to make my own, I grab a bottle of this delicious lemonade to enjoy by itself or with a delicious bbq meal or light lunch (especially in the summer). The perfect blend of tart and sweet!
--------------------
This is one of our favorite drink brands in our busy household. It has sweet and tangy drinks and they are comparably pretty good for you in the process unlike similar drinks from other brands. Highly recommend for delicious flavor you can feel great about drinking ❤️ Simply Lemonade With Raspberry Juice 52 Fl Oz
--------------------
Our family lives for this lemonade! It's so refreshing, sweet, and just the right amount of sour. It doesn't have a ton of pulp like other lemonade and I love that it's pink! Perfect on a hot summer Day of any day of the year!
--------------------
Our household loves this lemonade. We are all big fans of the raspberry flavor. It's sweet but not too sweet, and not too tart. I really enjoy it and I'm not a big lemonade fan normally. It's very delicious and refreshing!
--------------------
I love how sweet this drink is without being overly sweet. It's perfect for when you're craving sweets but don't want to feel the sugar. There honestly isn't much I'd do to change this product or improve it in any ways. Overall I would definitely recommend this drink, and the whole brand, to others!
--------------------
This is one of my favorite drinks. I love the light refreshing taste. For sure a staple during the summer months. I even love the pulp. It's terrific
--------------------
My favorite lemonade brand to drink. I especially love the raspberry kind of the lemonade family. Sweet and tart at the same time. I love that there is nothing artificial in it. The flavor is amazing. I love it anytime, but especially with a bit of vodka in the summertime.
--------------------
Love this Lemonade! Just the right sweet taste of the raspberries to the tangy flavor of the lemonade. This is by far on of my favorite Simply drinks. Goes great with any party or brunch as well.
--------------------
Definitely the best raspberry lemonade out there! It's not too sweet and not too tart!
--------------------
Love simply beverages!! I really can't say enough about them. They are delicious. I hate when a juice is thick or way too sweet. These have the perfect touch of sweetness to them. Worth evey penney!!
--------------------
This lemonade is so good. It tastes fresh and is not too sugary. It is refreshing and perfect for whenever you want a drink. The raspberry flavor makes it so much better too. If you enjoy flavored lemonades, you would love this!
--------------------
Very tasty drink . I just wish it wasn’t so many dag on calories and sugar! I like most of simply lemonade’s drinks.
--------------------
This raspberry lemonade is so good! I can’t have carbonated drinks, so when I want something other than water or iced tea, this is my go to! It’s not too sweet and it’s tart. My favorite.
--------------------
I’ve never tried raspberry lemonade until I saw this and my gosh, it’s better than strawberry lemonade. It’s not as sweet as the strawberry which I love!
--------------------
This one could be my favorite flavor from simply lemonade, the only thing is that it could be to sweet for me, so I always add some water and maybe ice to make it perfect!
--------------------
I hate sweet lemonade and need more of a tart kick to it, and this does it for me! It has a great tartness that is not overbearing, and also has a great raspberry flavor! It also has a little bit of “pulp” which adds even more flavor
--------------------
It is the perfect mix between lemonade and raspberry’s. Not too over powering on Either flavor and cools you off. Great to use as a mixer for adult beverages as well.
--------------------
This is absolutely as good as you would hope!! It’s tangy and raspberry flavored. Neither is too overpowering. Great to mix with sprite or vodka (if over 21). One of our household staples, especially in the summer!
--------------------
This is so refreshing! It’s also great as a mixer with whatever liquor you prefer. It can be a little tart so something i had a splash of water.
--------------------
This is a great tasting juice when you want another variety of lemon juice. It's fresh and taste great with no aftertaste.
--------------------
Deliciously tart and sweet. I don’t drink it very often due to sugar content, but it makes an excellent mixer!
--------------------
I love other fruit mixed into lemonade and raspberry is probably my favorite. Like the original lemon, there is some pulp and the taste is somewhat tarte. The raspberry sweetens up the lemonade
--------------------
This one is my favorite. Its my guilty pleasure when i’m craving something sweet to drink. The other flavor that I absolutely love is the peach flavor.
--------------------
There's a chain restaurant that serves raspberry lemonade that I love. But when I'm not wanting to feel like family or carbo-load then Simply gives me the same taste I love. Sweet and tart from the raspberries, it's so good.
--------------------
A little too sweet for me, but still refreshing. I will say it’s one of the more affordable ones for the quality of what you’re getting.
--------------------
I try to stick with water in the summer, but when I’m craving something sweet and refreshing I like to drink these. They’re sweet and they taste delicious! I also love the taste of the raspberry and the bottle is so cute.
--------------------
Delicious! Not as sweet as other juices and perfect for raspberry lemonade & vodka for a light summer drink.
--------------------
My favorite summer drink! It’s super refreshing and delicious. I love that most of the ingredients are natural. I wish it had a little less sugar, but it’s definitely worth it on a hot day.
--------------------
Delicious and refreshing. The raspberry juice is a nice touch to an otherwise basic beverage. Good flavor, no improvement needed.
--------------------
I love that this product isn’t too sweet, but it’s also a tad bit tarte. It’s really good blended as well.
--------------------
Literally all I ever drink. I have tried so many lemonades out there and this is by far the best one and I keep coming back!
--------------------
Love this brand, the raspberry lemonade is awesome and the 2 pack is a wonderful deal!!!!! Great product!!!!
--------------------
Love all of there products!!!! This is definitely one of my favorites!!!! Perfect amount of raspberry juice!
--------------------
Very delicious and refreshing! My kids love drinking this lemonade on a hot summer day with lots of ice. Will defitnely be purchasing more of these
--------------------
Loved this product for a hot day sitting in the sun! Paired perfect with a nice vodka or champagne. We used this at my bridal shower and it was a huge hit! Proced very reasonable and can be found almost anywhere. I buy this product at least once a month during the summer, a household staple!
--------------------
My favorite flavor of all the simply lemonades. The raspberry flavor is just right in this drink. No artificial taste. Cheap price and easily found in all my grocery stores.
--------------------
All simply products are delicious. They taste fresh and higher quality than similar priced competition
--------------------
This is sweet and delicious. The exciting cousin to your favorite summer drink. It’s sweet and sour and Simply is a brand we trust for our kids
--------------------
Such a yummy lemonade! I like the raspberry one because it gives it a kick which I really enjoy. The only reason it doesn’t get a 5 star is because it is quite sweet which I’m not the biggest fan of. I normally like to water mine down (usually half a glass of lemonade and the rest water) other than that a great option!
--------------------
I love raspberry lemonade and this company makes it PERFECT. It has great flavor for a great price too! You can find it at most grocery stores so you will never have a problem finding this product. Great for dinner time.
--------------------
So freakin delicious. All time favorite, I can drink it everyday of the year lol. It’s sweet and so refreshing
--------------------
Oh my God simply lemonade with raspberry is my all-time favorite I’ve purchased of numerous of times and it taste so good it is not so sweet it just taste like straight lemonade but with a touch of raspberry
--------------------
A staple in my house- the best most refreshing lemonade on the market! Priced fair and worth it-sure you could get a cheaper drink but why? It’s the top brand! I buy it again and again.
--------------------
My favorite lemonade especially during the summer. I love the raspberry blend with the lemonade. Very refreshing and tasty!
--------------------
I haven’t had anything this good that wasn’t concentrated. I love lemonades and this one gives me intense flavor it’s my go to I haven’t ever been let down by simply anything I highly recommend it if u want a fresh lemonade taste.
--------------------
Taste great but doesn’t real quench my thirst. Gotta drink a bunch and still need water after. Great to add to a cocktail or mimosa!
--------------------
This is so delicious and refreshing. Great price and great flavor. You can't go wrong. The bottle fits easily in my fridge too which is nice
--------------------
Not a huge lemonade fan, but I love raspberry, so this was perfect for me! Makes a great mixer for adult beverages and can be easily enhanced with a sprig of mint or basil for an easy cocktail.
--------------------
Delicious - some have even mixed this in drinks. I’ve done it too and I love it. All year round, at that. There are no cons, no room for improvement - at least for me. I’m impressed with it.
--------------------
I prefer this brand of juice over any other brand, it taste great and its a great mixer for cocktails in the summer. Also has a variety of flavors. I also like the packaging, as it comes in a clear plastic container. I prefer to see what I am purchasing.
--------------------
Love this! The raspberry flavor mixes very well with the lemonade. It pretty much tastes like summer. Definitely would recommend.
--------------------
Very sweet my kids love this product but no me, but I keep buying this for them because they keep asking me for this
--------------------
One of my absolute favorites! Also awesome to mix in smoothies and mixed drinks! This is constantly in our home during the summer so refreshing and the right amount of sweet and tart!
--------------------
Tastes AMAZING. Doesn’t taste artificial or too sugary or sour. This drink is great by itself or to mix with others or make slushees and smoothies.
--------------------
All the simply products are the best! I’m a huge fan of lemonade, but store bought never hits that spot, unless it’s this! Throw some strawberry in there and you’ve got a real winner!
--------------------
Great taste and I think not just for morning. It’s a nice change in the afternoon it’s hot a nice cold glass of lemonade over ice does the trick.
--------------------
It was too tart for me but I used it vodka and was pleased. I love most of Simply beverages
--------------------
My favorite flavor of the simply lemonades for sure! So sweet and yummy and amazing to freeze and use for popsicles or other yummy treats! Great summer drink and always a fan favorite!
--------------------
Simply delicious would also be an accurate name for this juice. It was crisp, fresh, and I couldn’t get enough of it. I always buy two when I pick these up because everyone in the house loves it.
--------------------
Good value for the money, pretended to be too sweet. It seem to need a stronger hint of acidity. Very flavorful and very colorful though
--------------------
This lemonade is good but it's a little to sour for my taste. The raspberry is too strong and makes it taste even more sour.
--------------------
I love lemonade I love raspberries, I love this raspberry lemonade. It has the perfect balance of sweetness and tartness, without one flavor overpowering the other. Every time we buy the Simply raspberry lemonade, it goes quick! Its truly a household favorite.
--------------------
Even I’m not a fan of ready to drink lemonades because of the sweetness this is definitely my favorite! Nothing that a little of water can’t fix but keeping that refreshing flavor
--------------------
Love this lemonade! One of my favorites! Nice, easy to handle bottle. Simple label. Would not improve, it’s perfect as is! Definitely a repeat consumer, we buy this regularly. Would definitely recommend to others!
--------------------
Pink lemonade! What’s not to love. Still sweet and tart but a hint of raspberry. Great for cocktails
--------------------
I love this Lemonade! We can’t keep it in our house long enough! It has a great taste that isn’t too tart and I like that it’s just simply lemonade without a ton of extra ingredients!! Great lemonade!!
--------------------
The best raspberry lemonade I’ve ever had. And it’s so cheap! I love that you can pick it up at any grocery or convenience store. The slim neck on the bottle makes it easy to pour. Ans the flavor is so much better than any other brand.
--------------------
This is my favorite convenient, in-a-bottle lemonade brand. I feel like it's the healthiest option available on the shelf besides making your own with actual lemons and I like size of the bottle. I feel like it's an adequate amount for the price. And it tastes the best out of the other options. This particular flavor might be a bit sweet for my tastes but it is super good for a hit of richness from the raspberry flavor.
--------------------
I love the taste and the package and it doesn't cost a arm and a leg everyone in my house loves the taste.you cant go wrong with this brand.
--------------------
I’m not too much on beverages that aren’t water but if I’m craving some lemonade I get this stuff. Not too sour, not too sweet.
--------------------
Sweet and tart. Both flavors of lemon and raspberry come through. Could use more fruit juice.
--------------------
I love just about all Simply Lemonades. Simply Lemonades have the perfect amount of sweet and tart and is very refreshing. I normally purchase them when it’s a sale. That’s when I rack up. I always purchase and I will continue to purchase.
--------------------
Very tasty. It is sweet but very refreshing on a hot day. Love the extra flavor of the raspberry.
--------------------
That's my absolute favorite simply drink. They are perfect for a mixed drink. A little on the expensicve side
--------------------
Tart and sweet. The best lemonade with crushed ice!!! Perfect for a summer day or a summer cocktail base. My favorite.
--------------------
Great for someone who wants something new. It adds a level of sweetness to the drink that still feels natural and inline with the original simply.
--------------------
I BUY THIS FOR THE FAMILY. THEY LOVE THESE DRINKS JUST AS MUCH AS I LOVE THEM. THESE DOES NOT LAST LONG IN MY HOUSEHOLD.
--------------------
Love this fresh twist on a fave summer beverage. Iced down on a hot day, simply delicious! Always makes it to brunches and picnics.
--------------------
OK flavor, not quite as yummy as the original lemonade flavor. It tastes a bit artificial to me, but still refreshing on a hot day. I generally do not purchase if the original flavor is available. Would recommend.
--------------------
Refreshing and amazing. The perfect beverage to quench your thirst in the summer time.
--------------------
This is the best lemonade I’ve ever had. It’s delicious and my absolute summer drink. Delicious.
--------------------
Love this stuff! Great refreshing drink for parties and for a hot day at home. The raspberry flavor is not overwhelming and the sweetness level is just right. It’s a staple in our house!
--------------------
I love waking up and having a glass of this it's so refreshing and rejuvenating definitely awakens your taste buds.
--------------------
It is the best juice I’ve ever had and isn’t too sweet but isn’t too bitter it also has a tang taste but it isn’t too strong! It is a very very great value and it’s super cheap I would highly recommend it
--------------------
Refreshing. Delicious. I try not to look at the labels to know how bad things are for me. Could be full of sugar but it’s delicious so it okay. In moderation of course. To much of anything is bad
--------------------
OBSESSED with this lemonade. I only drink water but when im craving something sweet with my meal this is my go to drink it’s amazing and it’s not sour!
--------------------
The BEST lemonade! Always my go to and I really don’t buy any other lemonade brands. Very refreshing
--------------------
The raspberry and strawberry added flavors are oh so good. Would highly recommend to anyone that likes lemondae and added extra flavors.
--------------------
I bought Minute Maid Fruit Punch when I knew my niece and nephews were coming for the weekend. It didn't even last one day after they tasted it. It was a hit. They drank it throughout the day. I will buy again when they come over. It wasn't too expensive either.
--------------------
Great taste amazing flavor I love this brand and my daughter love it too the flavor is natural and is very refreshing is good for partys
--------------------
One of the best fruit punches I have ever had. Amazing price. I love the jug that it comes in. Great juice.
--------------------
Love the nice refreshing taste nice drink to drink with a quick breakfast lunch or dinner meal Love that it comes in several varieties very sweet taste and low in sugar fresh oranges
--------------------
This is a family favorite. Sweet and filling. I like that it doesn’t waste cans or bottles. It doesn’t last long in my house. Everyone has to have some. It’s a good deal in comparison to other brands.
--------------------
Love this product have great flavor awesome color big bottle me and family love it I recommend
--------------------
This drink is the best it doesn’t even last one full day in my house. Perfect for kids or adults everyone loves the flavor and goes great with anything and great price point as well. Will always buy this when i can.
--------------------
I always buy these juice . there so good . I enjoy drinking these . I would recommend it to everyone.
--------------------
I love the great taste of Minute Maid fruit punch honestly its my favorite
--------------------
My kids love this and I don’t mind buying it for them. I like the big jug of it. It’s tasty. Fruit punch. Vitamin c. Only problem is it’s red, and well, spills. I do buy this product once in awhile as a treat.
--------------------
Minute maid fruit punch is delicious. Has no carbonation i love that . Kids can have it an it's not like giving a coke . A must try
--------------------
Grew up loving Minute Maid!! Fruit punch is a great flavor. Only improvement I would do is make it less sugar.
--------------------
We literally buy this juice by the gallon! My husband and daughter love it and it’s their favorite!
--------------------
This is my go to fruit punch i can drink this like its water! It taste really good! This is the only fruit punch i ever buy
--------------------
My daughter loves this! Everytime we go to the store its her 1st choice pick! She says its delicious! It always makes her jump for joy! Minute Maid 100% Natural Premium Fruit Punch - 1gal Influenster
--------------------
This stuff right here... CRACKKKKK! like how can something taste so good? If it didn’t have so many calories I would down this 24/7. In all honesty my favorite childhood drink and I always purchase this from time to time for the nostalgia.
--------------------
This fruit punch is pretty good and it's very affordable. It's a bit pineappley for me sometimes, but I'd still recommend it.
--------------------
Minute Maid makes my favorite juice flavors. I have been buying this product ever since my first purchase i am pretty sure I’ve had every flavor LOL . It comes in great packaging and it is very affordable. Tasty, fruity, hydrating!!!
--------------------
This is a good drink and it can be pretty addictive I love the flavors and the way it taste
--------------------
This Minute Maid is the best drink ever I love it so much it will never fail and the price to buy it it’s not even that bad it’s an really good price honestly
--------------------
I love the Minute Maid Premium Fruit Punch juice so much. This juice is very inexpensive and the flavor is so good. I recommend trying this fruit punch out!
--------------------
If you want your kids to grow up having diabetes this is a fabulous product. It’s only 5% juice. It is full of the dreaded high fructose corn syrup which is a highly processed sugar that only exists because of our economic war against Fidel Castro in Cuba. Yeah it tastes good because the chemists at Coca-Cola corporation know how to use artificial flavorings to great effect. I’m kind of disgusted with how positive the reviews are for this product, clearly these are fake reviews paid for by some company to prop up what is well known to be a disaster for health.
--------------------
The BEST fruit punch I’ve ever had. My fiancé and our children are obsessed with it too! Every time I go grocery shopping he reminds me to get some! There isn’t a dark red color to the juice like most fruit punch drinks so that’s really nice since I have small children that still spill things from time to time!
--------------------
You can’t have this more than two days in your house because you just keep drinking it because it’s just that good I keep buying more even though it runs out that quick
--------------------
This product has an excellent taste, but is costly and not a good value. I will not purchase this product again in the future, but recommend trying it.
--------------------
Fruit punch is the best. They’re amazing and they do leave a dry taste but it’s so good.
--------------------
This is a cheap and delicious juice but it is very sweet and unhealthy. I like to drink this on a hot summer day.
--------------------
Refreshing when orange juice gets a tad bit boring, however it can be too sweet and leaves a weird kind of aftertaste too
--------------------
My kids love all of Minute Maid juices. They are pretty good. Not the best available.
--------------------
Every-time I go grocery shopping I buy this. It’s super affordable and tastes great! I will always and forever but this product
--------------------
We love this product this product it affordable and it compared good because it affordable no improvement needed
--------------------
The best flavor of Minute Maid out there. It tastes like actual fruit, a lot of fruit in one drink
--------------------
This juice brand always provides fresh juice that tastes great! You have to refrigerate or it will go bad
--------------------
So yummy I love this juice. It doesn’t last in my household it goes quick. Love the smell and taste.
--------------------
After a while in the fridge, it starts to taste bad but it’s decent in a can. I don’t get it a lot so I don’t really recommend it.
--------------------
I love this juice it’s a great flavor. It’s affordable and it’s great to drink with a nice breakfast and lunch.
--------------------
I don’t typically like drinking juice but this drink is the exception! All the flavors together are so delicious and I crave it all the time! This exceeded my expectations and I definitely will be buying again.
--------------------
Would recommend. Very tasty drink. They have multiple flavors here and there. Everyone should try it.
--------------------
If you are looking for something not so sweet then do not try this juice. It is good but very sweet.
--------------------
This is a household favorite. Apparently everyone loves the way this taste over any other brand. They usually offer sales which is efficient if you buy 2, and the packaging just draws you in. I def would buy this again!
--------------------
This taste so goodddddd love fruit punch drinks it’s affordable and love that they have more flavors
--------------------
Juice is refreshing and delicious. It is normally gone within the first two days of being in the fridge.
--------------------
Too much sugar but tastes good!! They are cheaper than other juices. It’s packaged in small and big
--------------------
Fruit punch is awesome. This one is luckily not too sweet. I love having a glass when im sick of soda or water.
--------------------
Love this ! I also love adding a fresh lemon In it ! Sooo yummy ! Not too sweet but just right !
--------------------
I don’t like these juices very much. It’s only at my house because someone else like it and they prefer that juice. I don’t like the carton and I think it’s hideous and I don’t like all the un-natural ingredients that they place into this product. Not to mention the dye. Maybe there is no dye but I don’t know￼. I just don’t like the taste it seems artificial to me. ￼
--------------------
I find that this fruit punch is extremely refreshing especially on a hot summers day. I often buy the mini juice boxes just to have while traveling, it definitely helps with those times that you have a thirst quench
--------------------
love this punch, love that its inexpensive and that it tastes good on its own or have it in a mixed drink, one of my favorite mixers
--------------------
While this juice is delicious and really makes my mornings, it is practically devoid of any nutritional value. You can’t justify the sugar content with vitamins or other vital nutrients because there are none. I was shocked to read the label and see that it didn’t even have vitamin C.
--------------------
I like it a lot. It’s super tasty. It isn’t overpowering however. I definitely recommend to have
--------------------
I have been on a binge of drinking this for the past week & nothing else lol. Except i’ve purchased the 12 pack of cans instead of this. Absolutely love the flavor & highly recommend.
--------------------
Quinches your thirst with every swallow. Comes in a different variety of flavors. Not too strong and not too weak
--------------------
If you say you don’t end up drinking this in the first 5 hours of purchasing it you’re definitely lying.
--------------------
Literally my families favorite drink we stock up with like 10 in our fridge every time we go to the store. The only thing I sont like is sometimes theres alot of thick pulp and I feel like I'm choking. Other than that I would definitely recommend!
--------------------
Fruit punch was my absolute favorite flavor of Minute Maid. Once again these juices weRe always a tad sweet so I had to cut them with water but this one I usually drank as is. Back in the day the end of the bottle always had these dark floaters, probably the sugar.
--------------------
This is the best fruit punch juice you’ll ever get. The packaging is very nice it’s affordable it has good flavor they make other flavors as well, kids love it￼￼. I would definitely recommend you trying it ￼
--------------------
I love how juicy the Minute Maid juices are. Great taste and great for the price. The fruit punch is an all time fav!
--------------------
This brand of juices are really good. Always have it at home and in different flavors
--------------------
My go to fruit punch! I could drink half a carton in 1 sitting. Love it. Never disappointed!
--------------------
This juice is so fordable and it is so good it is the juice that never last in my fridge because everybody drinks it so quick and I love it so much￼
--------------------
Buy this it will be gone in less than a day it’s so good and refreshing!!! I started buying cans to last longer!
--------------------

--------------------
I love buying this fruit punch for my kids it's a great nice drink for the summer I just for their snack or for their lunch or dinner definitely recommend it a little does not go a long way because I have a family of 5 of course so one last me one day
--------------------
Great fruit juice that is made for everyone. It’s a must have in my household. No improvements needed.
--------------------
Affordable compared to competitors. Flavorful juice that my whole family loves! You can find it at nearly any grocer
--------------------
This product is so good and so sweet! I love it compared to a lot of the other juices out there. It’s affordable and I would recommend this to everyone!
--------------------
Who doesn’t love Minute Maid Fruit Punch? It tastes amazing in any of the containers it comes in. This is another juice that doesn’t last long in my house!
--------------------
Too much sugar but great price. Always taste fresh. Will drink moderatly. Flavor is well known and liked by many.
--------------------
I think that this tastes amazing. It does run out super fast though especially if there is more than one person drinking it
--------------------
Allways have this in our fridge 95 percent of the time really good and really refreshing
--------------------
I love many of the Minute Maid juices they’re all great it’s got nice packaging not too pricey or too sweet.
--------------------
Great for breakfast, lunch, dinner and mixing drinks! Whenever we buy this in my house it never lasts more than a day bc it’s so addicting
--------------------
This fruit punch isn’t too sweet. if you want juice, but not something that’s going to make you feel like you ate a whole cake, then this is it.
--------------------
I have to buy three at a time for my family. They love this juice! Definitelly affordable!
--------------------
This is probably the best juice I have ever tasted in my life and it is very addicting. The only thing is it does not quench your thirst I swear after drinking this I need something to drink.
--------------------
My grandkids love Minute Maid fruit juice!! It’s a good choice for them and I feel it’s much healthier than some other alternative drinks. Great tasting too!!
--------------------
This is one of my favorite juices of all time. I love the taste it reminds me of the tropic juices. I’ve been buying it for years and still buy it. It’s also very cheap and worth it. I would but it again :)
--------------------
My kids love this carton of juice it has a very satisfying taste You can taste all the fruits in it very resonably priced too
--------------------
This juice is fairly priced and great when it’s warm outside. Not too sweet or tart like some other brands. Packaging could be updated though.
--------------------
My favorite juice , really refreshing and love the packaging I really recommend if u haven't tried it yet
--------------------
Love this! It tastes sooo good. I literally finish it the same day bought. Not pricey at all
--------------------
I love love live this juice. It is so fresh and refreshing. I always keep a pack of this in my fridge.
--------------------
My kid loves this juice, and so does the whole family. Loaded with flavor! Highly recommend
--------------------
Good tasting juice but there is a aftertaste that’s lingers in your mouth. This is also a little bit higher in sugar than I would like. Nothing bad...but nothing that makes it great.
--------------------
This is so fruit drink and I love this a lot. Share with my friends and family. I mean who don’t like this.
--------------------
Love flavor juices, has great taste. I drink it every morning and night. Its a nice packaging.
--------------------
On a hot sunny day, this is the perfect drink for somebody who’s thirsty and thinking about fruit punch. It has nice packaging and the taste is even better. Fruit punch is the best kind!
--------------------
I love this juice it has a great flavor and it's not over the top sweet. I have tried it a few times and will continue to.
--------------------
Awesome flavor! Price is affordable and my kids love this juice. It meets my expectations and I would recommend this product. I put some on my kids Thermo for lunch or snack time at school. They enjoy it so much. Flavor is very good.
--------------------
I don’t know why but I really love the taste of this juice and so does the rest of my family. I drink it all the time.
--------------------
Love the fruit punch flavor. And this brand has such good quality. They are inexpensive and affordable it is hard to pass up
--------------------
This is one of my the kids favorite fruit punches. I do not like it the best and that’s why I only gave it 4 stars. I has a sort of weird after taste that’s a little bit to citrusy for me! I do buy this often for the kids tho.
--------------------
This is OK I’m not too wild about the fruit punch taste. Maybe if it had a sweeter taste to it I would probably like it a little more. The value is good especially for the price that you pay for it. I do recommend this product especially if you really like fruit punch because it’s not a bad product It’s just something I don’t care for like the regular orange juice.￼
--------------------
My oldest does not drink soda. Lemonade and fruit punch are his favorite non juice and nondairy drinks and Minute Made is his favorite brand for both. It's a great brand and I know he's getting good quality ingredients. And it's budget friendly. We buy a lot of juice drinks in our house and this and V8 are the ones we buy the most.
--------------------
My all time favorite juices but they are too sweet for me so I mixed this box of juice with some water to lower the sweetness
--------------------
Super refreshing. Wish there was a bigger size cause I go thru this within less than a week but I definelty love the fresh taste of this fruit punch drink.
--------------------
I’ve always loved this as a kid my great grandma always buys it. It’s good on the rocks with soda, liquor, or solo. The taste is way better than off brands and is very affordable. If you like fruit punch you’ll love this- highly recommended
--------------------
I don’t buy it much. I enjoy the taste. It’s affordable and I would recommend it to anybody just the sweetness of the product, but not to bad. No improvement otherwise I wouldn’t buy it again due to the flavor.
--------------------
This juice is the best. It’s tasty and will quench you’re thirst. It’s so good. Also the price is cheap! I buy this brand of juice all the time! I recommend buying this juice if you’re a juice drinker!
--------------------
Even tho it’s very sugary, this was my to go to juice when i was a child. I would beg my mother to get it when she would go to the market. I love the taste.
--------------------
My husband and I are obsessed with the Simply brand but we differ on our love of pulp. This medium pulp version is a happy compromise for us. The added benefits of Calcium and Vitamin D are a welcome bonus. Since we discovered this brand of orange juice, no other OJ brand has lived in our fridge. You will not regret trying this. Tip: Buy 2 because it will go quickly. You're welcome!
--------------------
LOVE the product. its amazing
--------------------
Tastes like normal apple juice. Nothing special.
--------------------
good value and great taste too. we like to buy these to fill up our little apple bottles with
--------------------
My 5-year-old who is extremely picky when it comes to Apple Juice really loved this stuff!
--------------------
Not the best... I’ll try another brand next time.
--------------------
i'm not a fan of a lot of juices because so many of them are of the 'cocktail' variety but this one has a lot of apple flavor. I prefer it to the major brands as it doesn't seem to be sugared up and therefore, neither am I. Also, since I think this is a great product, I gave it all 4 stars. My review is not nor has been solicitated and neither am I an employee. I just really enjoy this juice.
--------------------
Not a real taste of apple. Almost tastes watered down.
--------------------
I have a toddler at that loves her apple juice and would recommend this to anyone!
--------------------
I love this apple juice. It has a great flavor and it's much cheaper than other brands. I can usually find coupons for it which makes it a great deal! I would definately reccomend this to anyone looking for apple juice.
--------------------
Great product if you are on a carbohydrate restricted diet. The taste is not quite as good as regular orange juice but very close.
--------------------
Tastes like half orange juice, half water. You could just do that yourself and save a little money.
--------------------
If your looking for a healthier alternative to orange juice, this is the one for you! The bottle has 7 servings 50 calories per serving and 11g of sugar, that’s way lower than other orange juices. It’s also quite tasty, still tastes like orange juice!
--------------------
This pink lemonade is disgusting. Nobody in my house liked it so we poured it down the drain.
--------------------
One of my favorite orange juices to drink. Very smooth and tangy. I prefer pulp-less Orange juice so this one is definitely an option for those who are the same.
--------------------
This is the BEST orange juice- hands down! I love the high pulp version. Its great by itself, but pairs perfectly with a Prosecco for brunch mimosas. It is more expensive than the store brand, but it is worth the extra $0.78 that you are going to spend!
--------------------
Freshest OJ on the market.
--------------------
A lot of orange juices are pulp free. I love this orange juice because it has pulp. I prefer my orange juice with pulp.
--------------------
Absolutely love this juice and drink it practically everyday! I enjoy the fruity taste and really appreciate that it has no high fructose corn syrup in it!
--------------------
I recently bought this juice to try it and it is really good. I personally would say it is a bit sweeter than expected, but it is still good.
--------------------
This fruit punch is literally all I lived off of pregnant with both of my daughters and now it is the only juice they will drink. We’ve tried other juices and they will not accept. Thank you for making a fruit juice that is natural. I take comfort in that when giving juice to my toddlers. We don’t allow them to drive shelf juice. This is a staple in our fridge. We get one each week!
--------------------
This juice is good by itself, but it also is a great mixer for vodka. I have even tossed a bit in with my mojitos for a nice change.
--------------------
A great blend of flavors! You can really taste each of the fresh fruit ingredients! I would definitely buy again
--------------------
So better than Hawaiin punch i love it.
--------------------
This has been a refreshing drink for me this summer. I love the taste, and you still sometimes get a tiny bit of pulp. You get a nice amount, and the price isn't too bad. Definitely recommend trying.
--------------------
This juice is super good. It tastes like a high end fruit punch, and it also mixes well with vodka. I typically use the Smirnoff whipped cream & mix it with this, it’s seriously the best thing ever. I highly recommend giving it a try!
--------------------
A must have for our fridge. Very popular with visitors.
--------------------
It taste ok. It does taste fruity but it’s not fruity enough. It’s not my favorite drink but I do like that brand of drink.
--------------------
Love all of the drinks from this brand! This one is amazing! Love it! Very good! Highly recommend!
--------------------
Was slightly disappointed. Not my favorite, but not too bad. Probably won’t be buying this too often.
--------------------
Really good fruit punch! Doesn’t have a bitter after taste. Nice blend of fruits. Good price and value.
--------------------
This juice is very flavorful. I love it when it’s nice and cold. The packaging is great and you can reuse the bottle for another drink. It meets my expectations every time ! Everyone should try this brand. There are many great flavors to choose from.
--------------------
LOVE THIS JUICE. It’s so good and not overall sweet. It has a lot of different flavors that come out. It’s also good to creat a mixed drink or a sangria of some sorts. One of my favorite fruit punches out there.
--------------------
I try to stay away from juices because of the sweetness. But this fruit punch is a crowd pleaser. I usually mix it with sparkling water to cut back on the sweetness. However, this doesn't last long in my household. It's inexpensive and just downright tasty. Its nothing like the fruit punch of my childhood. I'd definitely recommend this juice.
--------------------
Favorite juice! It does have a lot of sugar in it so I always mix it with water. Great for mixing in a cocktail as well.
--------------------
Yum! Simply makes really good juices. They are a bit on the sweet side, but not overwhelmingly so like others.
--------------------
A bunch of fruits mixed into one drink? Who wouldn’t love that? The taste is so flavorful.
--------------------
I normally get this for my kids and I have to say it’s great! It’s super affordable and I wish they made a gallon size one .
--------------------
This is my favorite brand for Fruit Punch! I don’t like too sweet of drinks, and this one is refreshing and fruity.
--------------------
I love Simply Fruit Punch. It taste so real & refreshing. It doesnt taste too sweet, which is perfect. I would strongly recommend.
--------------------
The taste is amazing but when drinking this do not add ice because the ice takes away the taste from it .so I rather just put it in the fridge to cool. It’s really good my kids love it ￼and I do too.
--------------------
When trying to find a juice that I felt confident in giving my son, I looked at so many ingredient lists on different brands. Simply juices are just that... Simply. Juice. No additives or questionable ingredients, and of course they taste great. My son drinks some everyday! The peach flavor is his favorite, but he seems to love them all
--------------------
I wasn’t sure what to expect from this. When I think of fruit punch I think of the sickly sweet fake fruit variety of my childhood. This is like Hawaiian Punch but 1000x better. Yes, it still has added sugar but you can really taste the actual fruit juices and it’s so refreshing.
--------------------
I have never liked fruit punch my entire life, until I had this kind. I can actually taste the flavors of the individual fruits in this. It’s delicious and tastes like real juice. Not Hawaiian Punch and other brands of fruit punches. I buy this juice nearly every week.
--------------------
I love tropicana! They have great juices for oranges and watermelon! But I specifically love this juice because I love fruit punch and this one has the best and strongest flavor! I 100% recommend this product!
--------------------
This is a great juice to have in the house. It is so flavorful. I like the blend of juices in it. I buy these often because it is one of mine and my wife’s favorite drinks. I really enjoy having a glass of it.
--------------------
A great fruit punch. I like the small amount of ingredients in the Simply juices. It’s definitely tasty and I will repurchase it in the future.
--------------------
Myself and my kids love this fruit punch. We have always loved Hawaii punch but this is a great alternative.
--------------------
Pretty good juice. A little pricey for me but overall tasty and delicious. Compared to Minute Maid, I’d prefer Minute Maid, as it’s cheaper and more flavorful.
--------------------
Love this for all occasions. Really good with club soda! Refreshing. Mild on palette
--------------------
This juice is so delicious. Simply brand is more expensive but SO worth it. Its slightly sweet without being sour and tastes real and natural. I highly recommend this juice for everyone to buy! I mean, who does not like good juice?
--------------------
Tasty and not quite as sweet as “fake” fruit punch! Always a nice refreshing treat :)
--------------------
Nice beverage for anyone wanting a change from the juice drinks that everyone else is selling
--------------------
These are simply amazing!! They taste so fresh and pure! However, they are a bit more expensive than other brands. The design of the bottle helps fit it in the top shelf since it’s slim which is nice also. The kids love it too!
--------------------
This is my favorite juice flavor, fruit punch. You taste several different kids of fruit. I love the berry flavor with some pineapple. It’s delicious and satisfying. I always grab this while grocery shopping and have to stop myself from drinking it all in one day. I will buy again and you should too.
--------------------
Yumm! I was skeptical to try at first but after trying I won’t be going back to other brands of fruit punch. Taste great and fresh.
--------------------
I’m not the biggest fan of fruit punch more generally because it always seems too sweet, but this would be the exception. Like other Simply Fruit drinks, it is well-balanced, and we use it for punch bowls at parties.
--------------------
I really like the simply fruit punch juice drink. It is one of my favorites. My husband enjoys it too but not as much as their orange juice.
--------------------
I thought this was way to sweet. It still tasted good but I would’ve hoped it had a higher percentage of real juice in it. This is the first time I have had this and I don’t think I will be repurchasing.
--------------------
It is a refreshing fruity flavor. Simply is my new favorite juice brand. Everything I try from them is amazing!
--------------------
This is the best juice ever I have it at breakfast every day I enjoy the small serving size bottles
--------------------
Best juice ever. I love this so much, and so does every member of my family. We would go through ten bottles a week if we could. Perfect blend of different juices and flavors. Refreshing and sweet. Definitely recommend!
--------------------
Super tart have to water it down to drink but once i do its fine
--------------------
It literally taste like red wine without the alcohol lol
--------------------
Delicious!! It a great blend of the various berries ancient too sweet.
--------------------
2nd household favorite besides the mango one
--------------------
If you like pineapple, this juice is so good!
--------------------
So good; very refreshing. It’s a little sweeter than plain orange juice, but our family of four really liked it. We drank the whole bottle at brunch.
--------------------
Love the flavor combo, is getting hard to find in my grocery stores. Glad Target has it
--------------------
We are repeat customers of Simply products, we always have at least one container in our fridge and the orange with pineapple juice is one of my kids favorites! The wonderful mix of orange juice along with the sweetness of fresh pineapple makes you feel like you're on a tropical island lol no, but seriously, I know my kids are getting a quality product with nutrients and pure ingredients when they're drinking Simply Orange and Pineapple juice! If you have not tried this combo yourself, I highly recommend you head out and grab one! You won't be disappointed!
--------------------
It’s hard to find the simply orange with pineapple but it is the best flavor they have! The pineapple adds just a kick of sweetness. My absolute favorite orange juice! Simply Beverages is always a trusted brand!
--------------------
Great mix in for alcoholic drinks, really refreshing and tasteful. Doesn't taste like it is from the concentrate but fresh from a pineapple.
--------------------
My favorite flavor of orange juice. Kids love it too.
--------------------
My boyfriend and I like to make breakfast together on Sunday’s. Our breakfast isn’t complete unless we have a glass of this OJ. It is Simply the best!
--------------------
Simply Orange is my favorite orange juice. I love this pineapple add on. It’s fruity but not overwhelming sweet. I’ve tried other flavors but this is my favorite one. I buy this on a regular basis. I would recommend.
--------------------
I love simply brand juices. They taste so good, are refreshing and have really good flavors.
--------------------
This is probably my favorite juice all time! If you like pineapple orange juice then this is the one to go with! It’s great alone and I use it to make mixed drinks as well. There’s nothing I can say bad about this juice.
--------------------
The only orange juice I ever buy! It has the best flavor and the added taste of pineapple makes it perfection!
--------------------
I bought this a couple weeks ago. It tastes fresh and a nice balance between orang and pineapple. It was a nice change from regular orange juice.
--------------------
I love pulp free orange and pineapple juice it taste so good. I personally do not like orange or pineapple juice with pulp in it. The pulp feels weird in my mouth so that's why I prefer no pulp
--------------------
I really enjoy adding this to my smoothies in the morning. The Citric taste just wakes up my mouth and body to get ready for a new day. I’ve been using this kind for a while now as it has a great balance of sweet and tart
--------------------
I’ve recently grown an obsession to pineapple and this really hits the spot for me! It is soo tasty! I crave it all day
--------------------
I love love love this Juice my boyfriend got me hooked on it! It has the right amount of orange and pineapple it’s just so refreshing and it goes great with breakfast in the morning!! Also mixes great with some Malibu rum! ￼#drinks ￼
--------------------
This juice tastes really good and is on the affordable side of most products. Love buying it
--------------------
Pineapple anything is delightful so this blend of orange juice and pineapple is great!
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite orange juice! I love the hint of pineapple. It is not overpowering but adds the perfect amount of sweetness.
--------------------
Omg this tastes like heaven lol. It’s very sweet, but so good. Great with breakfast, but also@makes a great mimosa or mixer for any other drink.
--------------------
Simply orange is good juice. I like the pulp free and the pineapple makes it even better. It’s not super expensive.
--------------------
A good mix of orange and pineapple juice. Not too overpowering or overly sweet. A good twist on the classic OJ
--------------------
One of my favorite orange juice varieties. I drink this on its own or use it regularly in my morning breakfast smoothies and it compliments everything so nicely. Very affordable compared to some juice brands and is always a staple in my fridge.
--------------------
This is my all time favorite orange juice brand! It has a great taste to it that doesn’t taste fake. Now I’ve had it I can’t go back to the cheaper kind. I like how Simply Orange is constantly adding new flavors too! Mango and pineapple are a few of my favorite flavors. I would recommend giving this brand a try!
--------------------
Okay so I love pineapple juice and if it could be the only thing I drink forever, i would. But adding OJ to it made it the perfect breakfast beverage
--------------------
Yum the orange and pineapple mix is so good! This is all i drink and its my fav! the price is reasonable as well for the quality
--------------------
Mmmm. My favorite juice! Simply makes all the best juices but this one blows my mind with how yummy it is sometimes.
--------------------
So yummy ! I do wish it had more of a pineapple flavor though , I find the pineapple flavor to be quite mild and I wish there was more of it. Quite good though and is nice for mimosas too. Bought this for Sunday brunch to make mimosas with and it was a hit.
--------------------
Favorite orange juice and it’s worth the price. The added pineapple gives it an extra kick and it’s delicious.
--------------------
The best tasting and best quality orange juice on the market. It tastes freshly squeezed and not processed.
--------------------
Our new favorite juice. More tart than sweet unlike the original orange juice. Great for smoothies and cocktails.
--------------------
I love the addition of pineapple to this juice. It’s better than just the orange juice and very refreshing. We usually keep both this and regular orange juice in the house and this is my favorite.
--------------------
Perfect for people who don’t like pulp in their orange juice and perfect for pineapple juice lovers. This drink is the perfect blend of the two fruits merged into one. Neither overpowers the other. Very liberating.
--------------------
YES! I pair this with Malibu Coconut Rum 8and it’s oh so delicious! Perfect tropical drink. I add a little peach schnapps or peach juice and boom, it’s on! Very good flavor, love this juice and recommend for mixing or just drinking alone.
--------------------
Absolutely fantastic. This orange juice has the right amount of pulp in it and the right amount of pineapple juice. It's been my choice every morning for orange juice and my choice of a base to add for some alcohol consumption as well. I would highly recommend it if you want something different from your normal orange juice.
--------------------
This was really good to make smoothies with! I go back and forth with wanting a creamy smoothie and a fruity one and this is my go to for the fruity ones. It’s a little too sweet on its own so I don’t drink it by itself.
--------------------
I rarely drink orange juice but when I do this is the only one I’ll drink. The pineapple in it makes it bearable. When I’m sick this is what I crave and I go through the whole bottle in a day or two.
--------------------
I love orange juice, especially if it's Simply.. so when I heard they added pineapple to it I was so excited. It didn't disappoint in the slightest! Absolutely delicious!
--------------------
Start your day with this goodnesses, nature choice, no added sugar, easily available everywhere
--------------------
Thus has thee Most strange taste it doesn’t taste bad when it’s mixed with alcohol beverages but on itself and just as a funky flavors me personally I’m not a fan of that if you are going that’s fine I would recommend it to those who like mixed drinks
--------------------
Love orange juice it's even better with pineapple juice, this is a wonderful blend of them both
--------------------
Great drink mixer!!! Perfect for the mornings with breakfast or if you’re having a sweet tooth! Hands down my favorite juice!
--------------------
This is the orange juice I buy most often. I always have a back up in my fridge, because I never want to run out. It’s the perfect amount of tart and sweet! It’s way better than any other brand of orange juice.
--------------------
Everything from the simply line is hands down a 5 star review. I will never buy another brand of orange juice. The products taste amazing and they aren't loaded down with artificial flavorings, chemicals, or sweeteners. I am definitely addicted to every variation of orange juice that Simply makes.
--------------------
I love this juice, but I wish it contained pulp. It is the perfect addition to mimosas or as a general breakfast drink. Highly recommend and it is an affordable price point.
--------------------
The best orange juice ever!! The pineapple compliments the organs juice perfectly! And the juice makes some amazing cocktails. I go through cartons of it all the time!
--------------------
I enjoy the taste of Simply Orange juices. I enjoy the taste of pineapple juice. When I came across this juice I was very excited to try but sadly it did not meet my expectations. It's just a tad too sour for me. I think it might need a bit more pineapple juice.
--------------------
LOVE LOVE LOVEEEEE. I like the @simply brand for juice because, it’s just JUICE haha. Sounds silly, but y’all know. I used to use this in my Apple cider vinegar drink! Not from concentrate, no added sugar and taste yummy!
--------------------
Very tasty and the pineapple adds a nice touch. Not your plain boring OJ. Sleek packaging and very delicious.
--------------------
Good balance of flavors, tastes fresh and pure. Good price, easy to store bottle. All flavors of this brand are good
--------------------
This one is really good! Wish it had a little more pineapple juice in it but it is great either way! Good price too!
--------------------
Very good taste great low sugar good for kids good when frozen..take anywhere and really no spills when tipped over..veru affordable
--------------------
delicious and convenient. always have these in our cupboard for quick sweet refreshment.
--------------------
This is very refreshing! It's convenient when you may not want to pour a cup of juice because these are ready to drink all you do is pop the straw in and go.
--------------------
My favorite juice pouches for my kids. They have a lot less sugar in them than Capri suns do and that honestly shocked me because they taste great! Cheaper than other brands and better quality, we buy them every time we go to the grocery.
--------------------
Great drink but a little sweet. Not too pricey and comes in many different flavors, I personally like the Strawberry-Kiwi
--------------------
My kids enjoy this product. They have try alot of flavors but like this one the best.they like the taste.no improve needed
--------------------
these are so good. my boyfriend and i recently brought these from the grocery store and have almost drank all of them in the past week because how good they are. yes, i would buy again. #kool-aidjammers
--------------------
These Kool-Aid Jammers are so yummy!! I especially like the Strawberry Kiwi flavor! Great for kids!
--------------------
These are aways in our fridge! I buy two or three at a time! Love the taste and flavor of it
--------------------
Kids love these drinks I kinda like them but children go wild for them.i would recommend this to anyone who has children in the house
--------------------
Its my daughters favorite. She likes all the flavours. One thing I dont like about kook-aid is their packaging. As most of us with know that how hard it is to keep it from spelling.
--------------------
My kids love kool aid jammers for an easy on the go beverage or for school lunches. I love that there are many varieties available and they love each flavor.
--------------------
My kids absolutely love love love these! They are quick & convenient! I definitely recommend
--------------------
Delicious drink specially for little kids they love it great when going to picnics or simply being at a party they dont make a mess since its a little bag and they usually finish it all in one sit
--------------------
These koolaid pounces are not bad. They are not as good as making koolaid yourself but they are not bad.
--------------------
I love the kiwi-strawberry flavor because it reminds me of being a kid in elementary school. If you had this flavor you were the coolest kid in school. I used to bring one for me and my best friend and we would dish about boys and drink our koolaids.
--------------------
This kids love these little pouches. We can throw them in a lunch box or the picnic basket and it’s a great taste
--------------------
These are so delicious. I just wish there was more there, because I finish it so fast. I have drank these multiple times. These are very affordable. I would like the product to be bigger. I would recommend this to a lot of people, and I would buy this again.
--------------------
Great product for the price and the taste is great will buy again in the future. My kids love it
--------------------
This kool aid is really good the flavor is delicious and its affordable its a really good on the go drink
--------------------
These are the best juice boxes. So full of flavor and every flavor they have is very tasty.
--------------------
Was my favourite of the koolaids as a kid! Great for packing in school lunches and very enjoyable! But flavour is all my personal preference!
--------------------
My kids love these. Easy to use and variety of flavors to choose from. We keep a lot of these for car trips
--------------------
I have always like these since I was young and even as an adult they taste great and very refreshing
--------------------
I love it this product its great. I think everyone should try it out. I dont know that my honest opinion
--------------------
These are full of sugar and don't have a great taste to them. I will not buy again and do not recommend other juice pouches are better. They taste really fake and don't quench thirst.
--------------------
This product is pretty much a great seller every time Im in the store I have to purchase especially if Im running out there is no excuse not to buy this product honestly its worth digging in your pockets for some change
--------------------
Nothing compares to these. These are my childhood. I'd drink one almost everyday at school. I just hated how little they were. Not enough in the pouch for me lol. I still enjoy these when I can drink them
--------------------
This one of my favorite flavors. Im always buying kool-aid jammers and taking them on the go wherever I go. The flavor is just so good. Definitely recommend them to everyone to try.
--------------------
Kool-aid hammers are my absolute favorite! Even right now, theyre my favourite juice brand and I can always drink these because its so good! This flavor specially is my favourite, its light but tastes great. Would recommend it for student lunches and also as a drink with a snack for adults because thats what I do!
--------------------
I love these from the summer time because we can freeze them and take them on long day trips they double up as ice packs for packing lunches but I hate the fact that it's all fake nonsense completely filled with chemicals packed with sugar. But I will admit seeing the mango option makes me wish that that was available here in Canada because my daughter would go crazy for that
--------------------
Great way to quench your thirst. These little packets are filled with deliciousness. They are priced good and easy to find
--------------------
Kool aid jammers are good just kool aid in a pouch easy for travel for school lunches field trips etc. all the flavors are yummy maybe like the Capri sun do a healthy line of kool aid drinks and your good to go always recommend
--------------------
Love having these in my house. I always have a house full of kids and these help out when they are thirsty and dont want to drink water
--------------------
Yummy ! Good and so easy and convenient for on the go ! I highly recommend. Also not expensive and very tasteful!
--------------------
Are used to drink these when I was a kid and theyre really not good. They are jampacked with sugar but they dont even taste like real fruit like how Capri Sun tastes. I really always hated these and I definitely dont recommend them. It would be different if it was something that was like a nice treat every now and then but the amount of sugar content in them does not balance with the way that they taste. I would never buy these again.
--------------------
One of my favorite brands of drinks great flavor,loyal brand love the variety of flavor. Love koolaidNo matter the flavor. Great snack for the entire family
--------------------
grew up with this and glad they still make it. and got new flavor also. cant rver go wrong with any of them
--------------------
I took a sip of my kids Kool Aid pouch and I couldnt believe how nasty it was. It was so artificial tasting and the flavor was off! We no longer buy these.
--------------------
Super good for party and to take to school. Its a little bit sweet and you can taste the keyway on the strawberry. My daughter definitely loves it!
--------------------
These are super yummy but full of sugar. I drink them occasionally. Not often though
--------------------
My kids love these in their lunch, quick and easy. I wish they were healthier but its kool aid
--------------------
I love almost anything strawberry kiwi flavored drinks and this didnt disappoint. I loved this!
--------------------
I love love this brand and all of their products i highly highly recommend it to anyone
--------------------
Koolaid gets five stars from me and my family.We only buy koolaid brand products for a economical nice drink for my home.The grandkids love it. When the grands come over they always know I have a cool nice drink waiting on them.
--------------------
These are sooo good especially when they are cold. I recommend them because they taste good and they are affordable and they have a variety of flavors to try from.
--------------------
Its its refreshing and it tastes good, especially cold. Its a great flavor cheap and the kids love it
--------------------
I love the Tangy flavour thats provided by this product. Its not too sour as well as not too sweet and is great for lunch boxes and summertime. I used to freeze it and eat it like a slushie as a kid
--------------------
My kids and whole family love this. We can drink it to feel refreshed without overly sugared up. Definitely a keeper in the fridge whether its in gallon form or to go. Definitely going to keep buying!
--------------------
My kids love drinking this koolaid and its always so reasonably priced as well. I wish they were bigger though.
--------------------
I like this drink and mostly kids likes this its falvour is very good and it has alot of flavours
--------------------
I love this Kool-Aid! Its so refreshing and its cheap and very easy to make! Its great for kids to have a quick drink!
--------------------
Love this flavor! Makes me miss the sour pack ones! Repeat constantly definitely! Super affordable
--------------------
Favorite flavor of koolaid ever! Wish they were bigger though. Like adult sized instead of kid sized! Haha
--------------------
Kool aid jammers that the favorite for my kids and the taste is so delicious
--------------------
Not my favorite flavor personally because I do not like kiwi, their other Jammers flavors are much better tasting.
--------------------
Strawberry Kiwi is a great combination. Taste great and easy to make. Nice packaging. Great price. I am satisfied and would recommend to others.
--------------------
Kool-Aid has been a staple since I was a kid, and now my toddlers love it! These packs are great for road trips, school or even at home on hot days!
--------------------
I am pretty sure I enjoy these jammers just as much as my nieces and nephews, who I buy them for! They're delicious, refreshing, and remind me of my childhood. Lots of different flavor variations, and all of them are just as good as the last. So good.
--------------------
This brand was always my favorite as a kid, and now my daughter loves them. They are reasonably priced and I usually get then for her monthly snack for school.
--------------------
Very easy too use . I like this for my lil brothers it's perfect for them since there Lil . The juice is so good no complaints
--------------------
You can never go wrong with buying these! So easy and convenient for when having barbecues with children, birthday parties, school snacks or just having children around. I know they contain sugar but personally think they are better than sodas.
--------------------
My 4 yr old loves these, so when they go on sale we buy her a couple boxes. They are full of sugar, but everyone needs a treat once in a while
--------------------
Is excellent should never stop buying super super recommended a strawberry flavor that stands out and stays in your mouth
--------------------
I feel like when I drink one of these pouches, I have to drink 3, because they are soo good! Would recommend for the little ones
--------------------
These are the best go to juices for the morning time for on my way to school.
--------------------
My children love these! They come in small, easy to open pouches and have a great taste. The price is very reasonable as well. A lot cheaper then Capri Sun. rhis is a Great buy!
--------------------
Best snack drink to have when your on the go and definitely good with your lunch combination
--------------------
I like different flavors of juices, this is a good idea when it comes to that. I like that it is also cheap and great for kids!
--------------------
The taste is really sweet, almost so sweet that it's off-putting. I cannot drink a whole jug that one sachet would create as it is too much. It also is much easier to just get a regular soft drink rather than having to make the kool aid myself.
--------------------
The juice is very sweet but not sweet to the point that they aren't drinkable. The kiwi is by far my favorite flavor , although it does not taste like genuine kiwi I love it !
--------------------
I LOVE STRAWBERRY KIWI JUICE !!! I have been drinking this since 1997 amazing so go get it !!
--------------------
This kool-aid flavor has always been my favorite. Ive had this juice multiple times and its very affordable for kid parties. I personally like these better than caprisuns. I would recommend this juice 100%.
--------------------
Delicious but sweet. It tastes more like just strawberry than kiwi. Is good with snacks
--------------------
10/10 favorite flavor of kool aid jammers. Taste is amazing. My brother and I love them
--------------------
An excellent tasting juice that's good for on the go. Very compact and easy to carry around. A good idea to carry around if you have little kids.
--------------------
It is a good price at stores very affordable. I buy it for my kid and tried it out and the taste is just disgusting.
--------------------
Me and kids kool-aid jammers are without a doubt the best drink to hit the shelves.the product design is simply genius the pouches are easy to hold and fun to drink it is so much easier to pick up a pouch and drink rather than spend the time mixing kook aid before I can drink it.keep it up look-aid man
--------------------
Love this drink! Even if Iam an adult I love drinking these! My little brothers always get mad that I finish them
--------------------
I LOVE THESE LITTLE POUCHES! I TAKE MEDICATION EVERY NIGHT AND LOVE THESE FOR THAT. IT HAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF JUICE I NEED WITHOUT HAVING TOO MUCH THAT I THEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PUTTING AWAY. THEY'RE MESS FREE AS WELL!
--------------------
Best drink!!!! You can take it on the go!!! Only thing is they don't put enough into the pouches
--------------------
I have tried this product before and it is amazing I really enjoyed the taste and the packaging of it is lovely it is the best compare to many other brands and I would definitely recommend it to others to buy again
--------------------
Never drink this juice warm, it has an acidic taste but when it's cold it's so good. Even better in the freezer!
--------------------
These juices are top juices to be used in party's any type especially for kids and they are the best taste ever
--------------------
Super delicious. I remember enjoying these as a kid and these were my favorite beverages cx
--------------------
i just love all the flavor they have but this one is one of my favorite. the only way i can drink them is if they are cold. i have a habbit that i have to put them in the freezer until they get cold they tatse better.
--------------------
I love just about all of kook-aid's different flavors but strawberry kiwi is my favorite. It's just the right about of sweet but not being overly sweet or sugary.
--------------------
These are my favorite favorite kool-aid drinks. They are so great and everytime i drink one, it makes me feel like im a little kid. However, i think the calories are too high for this drink.
--------------------
this is MY FAVORITE kook aid jammers flavor. It is perfect with the flavoring and the amount of sugar. It always meets my expectations and it's really good. It's very inexpensive and I love buying it.
--------------------
Nobody can resist a good ole strawberry kiwi Capri Sun. Whenever I purchase this item it gives me such good nostalgia of the times my mom would pack these in my lunch. Today, I'm a full time college student and I still manage to enjoy these delicious drinks. Capri Sun is definitely suited to fit all ages (:
--------------------
So good flavor, perfect size, for my kids for snack i love used every days this product
--------------------
I use to love these as a kid, especially the strawberry kiwi. It's my favorite. Sometimes I'll still drink these.
--------------------
Not really the best drink , i would not consider to get this drink , its affordable but the taste does NOT meet you expectations , i would rather get the Kool-Aid Jammers Blue Raspberry, not really a big fan of this one will not be getting again.
--------------------
I love strawberry kiwi flavors. It's delicious especially the kool aid jammers. Makes you feel good and want more. Has a good flavor,
--------------------
This juice is excellent for hot summers!!, Great for an outside picnic,this brand has a lot of flavors were you can choose from. Absolutely reccomend it to people who like to be outside.
--------------------
This drink is perfect for on the go trips with the family. They have a variety of flavors and this one is by far my favorite. This drink and a little snack is super easy, just throw it in a bag and you don't have to hear your children cry for snacks
--------------------
I absolutely love Kool-Aid Hammers! So I coupon and everytime the Kool-Aid Hammers are on sale I use all my coupons and I go out and buy as many as I possibly can grab! My favorite flavor is Strawberry Kiwi too! Ive tried grape and cherry but both taste like medicine to me. Yuck! But I love strawberries and I love kiwi's!
--------------------
One of my kids favorite juice to drink not too sweet witch I like I recommend it we always buy them
--------------------
Love the strawberry kiwi flavored look aid pouches. It is very tasty. Love that they changed to the clear bottomed pouches.
--------------------
I LOVE these !! My parents get this for my baby brother all the time and I drink most of them I love kiwi and this one tastes sooo good
--------------------
Love the taste. The juice is not sweet and there’s no pulp!
--------------------
The orange juice is a great way to start the day! I love the added calcium and vitamin D. The flavor is bright and citrusy, while not being too sugary. It’s not thick like other orange juices. It is also less calories compared to other brands.
--------------------
No pulp and does not get thick or sour at the end of the carton/last glass. My non dairy adult kids love this! It is getting harder to find and I am so happy Target carries it now.
--------------------
This is jammed packed with flavor. The taste makes it hard to stop drinking. It also mixed well with cocktails
--------------------
I love this juice, so much I usually buy multiple cartons at one time. Ive tried others and theyre either watered down or something. If they wanted or tried to improve it, they could add more strawberry. Definitely worth trying. Minute Maid Strawberry Lemonade
--------------------
This is a very tasty strawberry lemonade. It has a refreshing and natural flavor. Its an affordable pop to buy at most stores
--------------------
One of our favorite MM flavors. This one never lasts. I can buy three at a time and come home and 2 are gone in one afternoon.
--------------------
This strawberry lemonade is the best!! It taste amazing and it satisfies the sour craving. Definable recommend.
--------------------
Delicious strawberry lemonade. Minute maid has always been a great brand. Met me expectations with the first sip.
--------------------
Strawberry Min. lemonde is actually pretyy good!! I normally stick to my normal flavors but i had to try and its good
--------------------
Best tasting lemonade with strawberries. It's a little tart taste. Has tiny pieces of lemon pieces. Not pricey at all.
--------------------
So this is a really good drink especially for kids it is amazing and what are they really think I like about it is it tastes just like the fruit and I just makes you weren’t coming back for more but there’s like this weird after phlegm or aftertaste him about it but other than that I would recommend it for anyone￼￼
--------------------
This juice is great. It is sweet but in a good way. You get all the freshness of strawberry and lemonade through the juice. It has colorful attractive packaging and I will continue to buy and recommend to others.
--------------------
Sugary, tart and sweet. Its a good drink with a lot of flavor. It is a drink I grew up on. Probably not the healthiest choice, but it is good nonetheless and inexpensive at the store.
--------------------
Really good and tasty, not too overpowering as other strawberry lemonades which is why I like it. I highly recommend it. 10/10
--------------------
This juice tastes so GOOD! Whenever I want something sweet and fruity to drink I get this. It is a must have in my fridge.
--------------------
I love this drink. It is a little sweet and more tart than what I personally enjoy at the most, but overall is amazing. I love the quality or this product and how cheap it is! I love the packaging design and the overall look of the brand. They did a very good job with this!
--------------------
Somebody day Vodka? Oh, minute maid did!! This is my go to quick mix for a nice cocktail sitting the summer months. It doesn't need any adjustments for flavor. Other brands can have to much pulp for me so I love this. I would definitely recommend trying it with some frozen blueberries floating. Yum!
--------------------
This is one of the best juices to me. The strawberry and lemonade are so good. It’s not too sweet but I do put water in it for my kids. The package is nice and I would recommend it because you can compost it
--------------------
Definitely shake it real good before you open it so all flavors are mixed well. I like to pour this over ice and add either Vodka in a salted rim glass, or you can blend it with ice and Rum (I prefer Malibu Rum.) I am hoping for some other flavor combinations soon!
--------------------
I usually love pink lemonade, but I am not a huge fan of this one. It's a bit overly sweet for me, and not enough lemonade. However, it does quench the thirst when it's really cold.
--------------------
This is very delicious not the only flavor I have in my fridge. It’s super good on a hot day after working outside.
--------------------
this is my favorite drink , anything strawberry and lemonade is gooood asf . You can never go wrong with Minute Maid .
--------------------
I like strawberry so when I was told that they had this i had to try it. And it was good it wasn't bad . I dont i would buy it. It just didn't taste as refreshing to me and the strawberry ...... will there was not much of a strawberry flavor.
--------------------
A favorite in our house. Affordable real fruit juice. Perfect sweet and tart blend. Makes really good ice pops too when freeze
--------------------
It’s good just sweeter to me then I would like but I’m a sour person I eat sour candy and eat lemons like their oranges so when I buy something with lemon I want more of a sour taste and this to mee is just more on the sweeter side then tart but none the less it’s good
--------------------
Very refreshing! Not too tart! I mix it with some Strawberry Lemonade vodka, strawberries & ice - perfect summer drink!
--------------------
My kids love to drink Minute Maid Strawberry Lemonade. It is a staple in our home! I will buy about 4 cartons a week and they are gone in a few days. My husband is a big help with that though too!
--------------------
This juice is so tasty & refreshing. The price is awesome and it’s my go to lemonade for any hot day or any day really. Super good!
--------------------
Referring and delicious with the perfect balance of zing and sweet! Any time we need some lemonade, we turn to this! It's a family favorite! Summer treats get that much sweeter when we add this strawberry lemonade to our popsicle or smoothie making!!
--------------------
I love strawberry lemonade, and Minute Maid is no exception. I’m not sure if they’ve changed the formulation of it because it’s much sweeter than previously, but still delicious.
--------------------
This is my go to when I’m craving some cold lemonade on a hot summer day. It’s just the right dose of sugar. You can get it in a bottle or buy it in a carton. It’s not expensive and can be found pretty much anywhere.
--------------------
Great flavor and good for cocktails. They mix well and the flavor is just amazing. Recommend
--------------------
So refreshing! I’m more of a strawberry then a raspberry kinda girl. I love strawberry lemonade. Minute made is my go to for store bought lemonade. It’s affordable and delicious. I recommend it.
--------------------
This product reminds me of sitting on a balcony overlooking the beach and boardwalk of California. I love this product for so many reasons, it is punchy but sweet and makes great mimosas and is priced quite well!
--------------------
I love the mixture of the strawberry and banana and it’s not an overpowering lemon tast
--------------------
Another family favorite in our household! We love strawberries and lemonade and even though it’s sweet it’s affordable and lasts when adding water to dilute it! It’s refreshing and delicious! If you haven’t tried this people try you won’t regret it
--------------------
I usually love Minute Maid lemonade, just not a huge fan of the strawberry. I was bummed about it.
--------------------
So refreshing during the summer! My family likes to blend this up with Ice and make our own slushies to enjoy by the pool! Great for hot summer days and nights!
--------------------
This is a staple in my house. We love lemonade and when I dont get the smaller pink lemonade I prefer to get this one!
--------------------
So delicious, strawberry lemonade would have to be my favorite, and this is top tier!
--------------------
So delicious! Great alone or as a mixer with an adult drink. It’s not my favorite but it’s a close second. I prefer simply lemonade taste. The packaging is good and you can immediately tell what flavor you’re getting.
--------------------
This lemonade is pretty much the bomb. It is sweet yet tart. Absolutely delicious anytime you want it but much better when you just come in from being outside on a hot summer day. It’s my favorite lemonade!
--------------------
It’s great for the price and I love the taste of this over a large glass of ice. I guess my only negative would be the amount of sugar it has.
--------------------
Classic and tasty. This is always good. But hard to find this flavor at the store. Really like the strawberry lemonade. Great alone or for mixing drinks.
--------------------
I don’t know why but these boxes drinks by Minute Maid are for real the bees knees i don’t know what they put in them but there addicting 10/10 would recommend hands down nothing beats this NOTHING
--------------------
Households favorite lemonade. Great flavor combination and just what we like. Wouldn’t change this product other than it’s price.
--------------------
Love this I can’t get enough also it fits right b with my bugget they have other flavors u can decide on Minute Maid 100% Natural Premium Fruit Punch 1Gal
--------------------
Delicious drink, I always drink with some ice, the flavor of the fruit it’s so strong, and I always add more strawberry in dices.
--------------------
Very flavorful love it as any of the minute maid drinks I can never get enough of them and by end of day they give me heartburn but I love them anyhow
--------------------
Kiddo loves it! Kiddo and mommy approves. I still get them and other flavors as well.
--------------------
Prefer this to the original. The strawberry adds a sweetness that really elevated the flavor and makes this a very good drink
--------------------
I love love love strawberry lemonade. It's so good poolside. The flavor is great and doesn't give me heartburn. It's not overpowering and tastes great!
--------------------
Best juice ever but you probably already knew that. We swear by these and they come cold
--------------------
This one is just super sweet all around. You can definitely taste the strawberry and feel the tartness of the lemon. It's pleasant but definitely would beware if you are not a fan of really sweet beverages. It's almost cloyingly sweet. I buy occasionally and drink sparingly during summer months.
--------------------
I love that this is the perfect blend of sweet but not too sweet. Even my four year old loves it. Perfect for those hot summer days
--------------------
One of my very favorite lemonade brands. Sweet, tart and refreshing. Never disappointed. So many different varieties to choose from. Have enjoyed them for over 20 years
--------------------
Really tasty and refreshing. I would so recommend this beverage on a hot Summer day.
--------------------
THESE ARE GREAT DRINKS FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN. VERY REFREASHING AND FLAVORFUL. FOR ADULT BEVERAGES CAN BE MIXED WITH ALCOHOL.
--------------------
This is my families summertime favorite. We keep it stocked in our fridge. We even use this to make slushies. The best lemonade/strawberry juice.
--------------------
I love to mix with lemon lime soda gives it a great kick. Plus its super affordable. Love all the variety of flavors too
--------------------
Love the flavor of minute maid strawberry lemonade fruit juice. Great drink for a very hot day. The grandkids love it too.
--------------------
Love it! The right amount of sweetness on a hot summer day. Minute maid makes the best Lemonades.
--------------------
Mt kids love this product. They love all the different flavors and can drink this all day long if I would let them
--------------------
Love this product so much!! Minute Maid makes the most amazing drink combinations! Super yummy!
--------------------
So refreshing and tasty! I love anything with lemonade. So this fusion mix is really good.
--------------------
Very sweet and great lemonade. Perfect for cookouts! The price is very reasonable/affordable.
--------------------
This is a blend of lemon and strawberry juices from concentrate and other ingredients. Pasteurized. Contains no added preservatives. This is with minute maid strawberry lemonade, you can taste that goodness in every last drop. The refreshingly delicious taste of good times.
--------------------
I have a kidney disease and I was told to drink more lemonade. After awhile, plain lemonade gets kind of sour. This was the perfect amount of sweet and tartness that makes me keep buying it!
--------------------
My fave drink to get reminds me of the sonic or Wendy’s strawberry lemonade all it’s missing is the actual strawberry pieces
--------------------
I like this product! I’m so glad it comes in a bigger size because I drink this a lot!
--------------------
It’s good to drink once in a while but it’s to sweet for me. I rather drink Arizona green tea.
--------------------
It has a great taste. I don't like lemonade that's too tarte that's why I enjoy strawberry lemonade More. But even minutes maids original lemonade isn't too tarte and has a good balance of sweet. The strawberry lemonade has just enough yummy sweet fruitiness.
--------------------
I really like the taste of the strawberry lemonade fruit juice. It is better than other brands i have tried. Only improvement i can think of is maybe less sugar. I would definitely purchase it again and would recommend it to other lemonade lovers.
--------------------
I Love fruity drinks so I love the taste of this lemonade . I buy it all the time and I enjoy it . I will recommend it to everyone .
--------------------
Delicious! Highly recommended for those who enjoy a nice cold drink on a warm day. Kids love it! The flavor is great and it’s not too sweet. Very affordable.
--------------------
I usually buy this for my friends and family when I’m making mimosas or mixed drinks. They all love it when I use minute made. So bottomless mimosas almost at every party. Plus this is cheaper and won’t break my wallet. Lol
--------------------
After search and trying a lot of lemonades through my life, I must say this ended up being my go to now that I have kids. It isn’t super sweet like other brands and also is packed with flavor Minute Maid Strawberry Lemonade Fruit Juice 59 Fl Oz
--------------------
I love this. It's great to mix In a blender with Ice and make a slushie!! It isn't too sour and have a great flavor! Also super affordable which is great!! I love it!!! Great value!
--------------------
Yummy and refreshing drink. A little strawberry and a whole lot of lemon. I would definitely recommend this and purchase again.
--------------------
Although V8 Splash Mango Lemonade 64 Fl Oz Bottle is one of my absolute favorite this is a close second. Not bad at all. The taste is decent and cheap price!
--------------------
One of the best Minute Maid drinks, always good. Good drink mixer with alcohol too lol.
--------------------
For a cheap price, you get a pretty good drink! I like the flavor (especially during the summer time), but if you drink too much it starts to taste like medicine. And then I wish the packaging was a little bit sturdier.
--------------------
I love Minute Maid drinks. Drinks in a box are absolutely delicious and I love the lemonade
--------------------
The strawberry lemonade is the best in my own opinion. I prefer it over Soda. I drink it all the time it’s always on my grocery list
--------------------
Tart and sweet in all the best ways. Love this over ice, even as it gets watered down it still tastes great.
--------------------
ONE OF MY FAVORITE FLAVORS. I almost didn’t share with my family because it was so darn delicious!
--------------------
My favorite juice! It’s so refreshing on a hot summer day. It’s so affordable. GREAT to bring to the beach. This product sometimes leaks, but that could be user error, but I would recommend this to everyone!
--------------------
Add a splash of this when making a fruit smoothie and oh my! Tastebuds will be in heaven!
--------------------
Sooo good. I used to hate lemonade for some reason until I tried this one, I’ve been buying it ever since
--------------------
This product taste so good and its refreshing. I can't get enough of it. The packaging is simple but it so good.
--------------------
absolutely amazing!!! we buy at least 2 of these a week!! perfect for hot days or for just a quick drink!!!
--------------------
Yummm!!! One of my favorites! Perfect by itself or mixing with any of your favorite drinks! This is so refreshing on a hot summer day and is so tasty! I have this in my house a lot especially to substitute it for soda!
--------------------
This does not last in my house! This juice is so bomb! Great taste and a great mixer for cocktails as well
--------------------
This is a great drink for hot summer days with ice my kids love it we try to always switch up the drinks we give them
--------------------
We use this at the restaurant I work at to make our strawberry lemonade and all the staff loves to drink our lemonade. It’s a perfect summer treat.
--------------------
This has to be my favorite flavor! it’s flavorful and so refreshing. I have always loved strawberry lemonade when i visit restaurants but now I can have a whole pint to myself!! It’s amazing life is great!
--------------------
SUPER good and refreshing!! I couldn’t believe how easy it was to find it at my local store.
--------------------
I always get these for my home and it disappears after a couple hours because it is just so delicious! Only way to improve is if you can make more haha
--------------------
I mean it’s full of sugar so what’s not to like about it. It’s super refreshing. I think it’s so good that it goes fast so that sucks.
--------------------
My favorite from Minute Maid! Refreshing and fruity. I could drink it forever, but it is very sweet, so not good for people who don’t like lots of sugar.
--------------------
I really liked this flavor, but I don’t get it often nor do I get it because it’s a lemonade. This taste more like a juice to me than a lemonade, but over all this is a good drink to buy for the family.
--------------------
I’ve never had anything bad to say about Minute Maid! They are absolutely amazing! Great for adults and great for children. This is the best brand juice you will find. I promise you nothing beats Minute Maid!
--------------------
I really love this juice cause the flavor is so delicious and I think this product is the best one cause we can carried every were and is small I love it
--------------------
Horrible taste like cough medicine I really hate it I like thr fruit punch the most it has the best taste I really don't like this one
--------------------
Excellent juicy very berry yummy yummy drink
--------------------
This drink always brings you back to my childhood days. Its really good and sweet (a good sweet), and its only about 30 cal per pouch. I love everything about this product. I love Kool-Aid, I love the flavor, and the packaging is nice. The flavor is always so consistent and its very inexpensive to buy a 10 count box.
--------------------
My son loves, loves, loves these drinks! They are perfect on the go! When he wants something other than water, it satisfies his craving. Very happy with kool-aid jammers!
--------------------
I buy these all the time for the kiddos because it's so convenient and easy to throw in their lunch for school or after school. They love them and hope crazy of them. Even though they are full of sugar, I still feel like it's better than soda.
--------------------
I buy these & the Capri suns for my son. He likes the kool-aid drinks a little bit better then the Capri suns but I personally think the Capri suns are better!
--------------------
I always have these at my best friends house and used to drink them when I was little. I love them wouldnt change anything about them and they are fairly priced
--------------------
Affordable so it don't feel bad when they go fast and you have to buy more, you can find them anywhere, many flavors, easy to drink and fun for kids
--------------------
My grandsons love Koolaid cherry ready pouches. It's very convenient and they can take them anywhere even to school
--------------------

--------------------
A mi hijo le encanta el sabor de este jugo, lo compramos en todos sus sabores, es el mismo jugo que tomaba de merienda cuando era nia por lo que me Gusta tambien.
--------------------
When I was younger I was obsessed with Kool-Aid jammers I still love to sip on one now and then so good
--------------------
My son loves these v I personally do not drink them. I wish they came in a larger form.
--------------------
My babies love these so far no issues with them yet since I see that some end up having these Nast molds and stuff inside so so far we are good from that will buy always until there something wrong
--------------------
kool-aid jammers are good for your kids to drink when yu dont want them drinking pop !
--------------------
Very easy to carry with you also handy for your kids if you have any. A little hard to get open if youre not used to it but this product is a good way to get happy
--------------------
My daughters love it! they are favorites !!!!!have many flavors and very cheapKool-Aid Jammers Cherry Flavored Drink Kool-aid hammers are my absolute favorite! Even right now, theyre my favourite juice brand and I can always drink these because its so good! This flavor specially is my favourite, its light but tastes great. Would recommend it for student lunches and also as a drink with a snack for adults because thats what I do
--------------------

these were the best next thing when they came out. i always wanted to get them at the grocery store. cherry is one of my favorite flavors of the kool-aid jammers. yes, i would recommend to others.
--------------------
Something about these just tatse so good. Maybe because it's a hot day and having one of these from the coolers just hit so differently than a lot of other drinks.
--------------------
Some quick and easy to pop out for the kids to drink keeping cool they can be frozen and defrost throughout the day
--------------------
Same Kool-Aid as I remember from grade school. I like how it has stayed the same through the years. Its reliable and fits In my lunch bag quite nicely. I think its worth the price. Its my go to when I want to buy juice for my lunch.
--------------------
I have loved kool-aid since I was kool-eight! This drink has perfect and easy to use packaging when youre on the go, or just want some more kool-aid. I am a repeat, repeat, repeat customer and am on my way to kool-aid heaven.
--------------------
Full of sugar but ha the best flavour out of all other juice box brands. Cherry is my favourite flavour.
--------------------
My kids love these and they are very easy to find and buu. Price is very affordable and super love these quick
--------------------
I love this product its great for on the go water bottles. I like how there is a variety of flavours.
--------------------
I buy these for my kids to go with a snack I just wish they gave more in the pack cause the go to fast!
--------------------
I dont not like this flavour but my daughter likes it. Again hate the packaging because of the mess it makes.
--------------------
Great little pouches for small children. Less likely to spill and has a spot ready for the straw. (Straws included)
--------------------
My kids love Kool Aid Jammers for their school lunches. I cant go wrong with any flavor I choose.... they love them all! I love that theyre affordable and easy to just grab and go.
--------------------
my kids love their koolaid pouches. when we dont have a pitcher made ourselves, we have a drawer stocked with these for the kids to grab and go.
--------------------
Affordable!! Easy open & great for travel! Great cherry taste! Not too sweet & a little tart!
--------------------
I grew up on kool aid but now that Im older the taste isnt there as much as it used to be
--------------------
As a kid Kool-Aid jammers cherry ready to go drink soft drink were definitely loaded in my fridge.
--------------------
We drink these up really fast only bad thing but still good to drink especially as a child.
--------------------
These are just a tad cheaper than Capri Suns, so they've been what my son gets in his home packed lunch for awhile now. He enjoys the flavor, I enjoy the price and convenience.
--------------------
really like this! I get a lot of use out of it and its consistent with other things Ive tried from this brand, I really want to try more! I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to a friend!
--------------------
This kool aid is a good drink for on the go , convenient packaging and comes with a straw also
--------------------
I love dinking these! This flavour is definitely one of my favourites, brinks me back to my childhood.
--------------------
My kids love these. They're really inexpensive. They do have a lot of sugar and artificial flavors, but what can you do? They're portable and budget friendly. I do wish they came in larger packages. Our kids pick these up quite a bit in the summer.
--------------------
I love using this product! It taste really well and it is very affordable! I have purchased this and used it with my whole family !
--------------------
This product is all my childhood memories in one drink. It was my go to soft drink to take for lunch during my elementary years and I still love the taste to this day. The cherry is a safe flavour to choose as it is widely loved by many. The packaging is both cute and efficient for all the "to-go" moments!
--------------------
so yummy but taste a little less sweet that the powder mix. keep them cold and they are so great.
--------------------
I love Kool-Aid for my grandchildren and my husband in the summer time. We love to make popsicles.
--------------------
Such a classic childhood drink. The flavors are so good and its a good value for what youre getting. I am satisfied with this product, and will definitely be purchasing again for family outings. So good.
--------------------
An absolutely classic. I had these as a kid and not I give them to my kids on occasion. Cheap and easy is definitely the best way to describe this.
--------------------
I buy these for my kids. School lunches. Baseball snacks. Affordable and kids love them easy to pack drink
--------------------
Perfect size, easily stored , tastes great , and the other flavors are delicious as well
--------------------
Great flavor with great taste. Its easy to use this. Has a rich and smooth taste. I have been using it for many years
--------------------
Who doesnt love Kool-aid? Right? My kids are not old enough to enjoy these quite yet but we still enjoy them in our house because they are easy to grab and go and perfect for on the go road trips and such.
--------------------
Great for the kids and were on the go and theyre very small to fit an ice chest with everything else
--------------------
My favorite of these is tropical punch, but the cherry is good as well. A bit tart but good nonetheless.
--------------------
Childhood fave growing up. This has been a staple in my family for a very long time. The flavor is delicious
--------------------
Sweets tooths it is ! This product is great for partys etc I highly recommend buying it for kids or even for you !
--------------------
I love it this product its great. I think everyone should try it out. I dont know that my honest opinion
--------------------
These are full of sugar and don't have a great taste to them. I will not buy again and do not recommend other juice pouches are better. They taste really fake and don't quench thirst.
--------------------
This product is pretty much a great seller every time Im in the store I have to purchase especially if Im running out there is no excuse not to buy this product honestly its worth digging in your pockets for some change
--------------------
For a school drink in a lunch box, this is one of the best choices for my family. I always look at the sugar content of the pouch juice and this one has the least sugar of them all including the organic brands. My kids love them and the variety of the flavors.
--------------------
Delicious spin on a pitcher of kool-aid. Love the little pouches for easy drinking and on the go fun!
--------------------
Great juice. Perfect for when youre thirsty. I like it a lot. Its pretty good and juicy.
--------------------
I used to grab these because they were cheaper than a lot of other brands but then I realized it had red 40 in it.
--------------------
These are Flavorful and my kids love these. Affordable and easy packed. Would buy it again.
--------------------
Perfect drink for the kids. Especially in the go or in a time crunch. Perfect on vacation to take to the beach.
--------------------
Kool aid is definitely a really high sugared drink but it tastes really good, and the best flavours are the blue , orange and red ones.
--------------------
I tried to go back but I couldnt so Ill just say it- I prefer the strawberry kiwi ones. Im not a mom, but these are good for moms to pack for kids to go to school. Theyre good, I mean really its just juice in a pouch.
--------------------
Do you like these drinks they are very convenient for on the go. I like how they have a strong with them so its easy to drink. I love a cherry flavor and I think these are great if you have kids and need a snack to pack for them. The only thing I dislike about this productIs that I wish they put it and I different container to drink out of.
--------------------
Kool-Aid was defiantly the best juice of my childhood! I always cried to get this juice over the rest of them with cookies and chips. It's a good solid flavor.
--------------------
My kids love to t Pouchts is and this is I play their favorite flavor they like these better than Capri Sun
--------------------
These are delicious for not only my kids, it for adults as well. The price is good and my kids always want me to buy these for them! The flavor is wonderful and it makes them happy!
--------------------
I like that they are always on sale and many flavota to choose from. They can bought anyyans they come in handy for your children's lunches, field trips and birthday parties. I like that they save you from washing cups and they can be taken on the go.
--------------------
This is life growled up on this stuff you dont want to miss out I totally recommend
--------------------
My kids love these and so do I. They are great for a quick on the go snack drink. The price is a good range too
--------------------
Favorite kool aid drink. Not to sweet and has great flavor. Kids also love it. The packaging is good too
--------------------
We buy these for my little one and he absolutely loves them, not to mention theyre quick and easy.
--------------------
I love the school and ever since I was a kid it is so yummy and has a really nice packaging
--------------------
This is a staple in the house, just tastes delicious! Always had Kool-aid in the house since I was a kid. Price is very good, but we go through them so quickly. Our favourites are, cherry, grape, blue raspberry!
--------------------
My younger siblings and son love kool-aid jammers...especially the cherry and blue packs! The are convenient to take on the go and easy to drink. They are very affordable, however they are very high in sugar content too.
--------------------
These are a great and very yummy/tasty. I love these and continue to by them again and again.
--------------------
Just bought a pack for my son , he loves these Koo-laid juices! Also there so affordable
--------------------
Cant go wrong with Kool-aid. Very affordable and great taste. Can be found at most stores and is good for a quick snack.
--------------------
Are used to drink these when I was a kid and theyre really not good. They are jampacked with sugar but they dont even taste like real fruit like how Capri Sun tastes. I really always hated these and I definitely dont recommend them. It would be different if it was something that was like a nice treat every now and then but the amount of sugar content in them does not balance with the way that they taste. I would never buy these again.
--------------------
My kids love these. I used to like them myself growing up. Not too much sugar and easy to give out with snacks or lunch
--------------------
Kool-Aid Jammers are easy self-serve for the older kids. They can just grab one from the fridge and go!! They are also great to pack for their school lunch or snack at school. Love the Kool-Aid Jammers, great to keep around for when the kids friends come over.
--------------------
I like this flavor alot it isnt overwelming with cherry but still it doesnt fall short either its just the perfect amount to satisfy my taste buds.
--------------------
I love Kool-Aid jammers this is my favorite I love Culebra anything these are perfect for bringing with you as a snack for your kids as I can for lunch you can fit a couple inside the diaper bag and just call it a day
--------------------
This is a great product 10/10 recommend. It worked for me and Im so happy with it! I would definitely buy the product again! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! Love it so much!!!!
--------------------
Our favorite flavor of Kool-Aid. Sweet yet delicious. Who doesnt love to drink Kool-Aid on a hot summer day or you can pack it for lunch.
--------------------
These are so nice to have around! Easily packed for trips and delicious. I love them
--------------------
Cherry is like an universal flavor I never hear anyone say they do t like the cherry Capri sun kids love this flavor and so do their shirts
--------------------
We have 4 kids who are ALWAYS thirsty. We go thru so much Kool aid and juice that is not funny lol. Assorted flavors too.
--------------------
A go to for the kids lunch! They love it. Love the flavor and the price is reasonable
--------------------
Love kool aid especially cherry and jammers are awesome for on the go or any occasion really. I lo e love love them try them put !
--------------------
My daughter loves these as a treat. Theyre very sweet so it isnt something we buy often. As a treat though theyre good.
--------------------
Good old cherry Kool-Aid. These take me back to my childhood as my Oma used to make the powder packets for me all the time. The jammers were the best invention..other than the ready-to-drink tubes they used to make.
--------------------
Kool aid jammers takes me back to my kid self! Lol affordable, but definitely needs more in the packaging
--------------------
have purchased the kool aid brand for myself and my family for over 20 years. The singles are only .25 a pack and the huge bottle is only $2.00. you totally save on your grocery bill by buying this drink for the family.
--------------------
You honestly cant go wrong with Simply anything. Its so refreshing and tastes like freshly squeezed lemons every time.
--------------------
Too good! Tastes like fresh lemonade. Can be higher in sugar than the light version but does taste wonderful.
--------------------
Love this lemonade so much along with all of Simply brand products. So fresh and full of flavor!
--------------------
My favorite lemonade on the market. Its not from concentrate which I love about it. It has the perfect amount of sugar and my son thinks its good too!
--------------------
The best lemonade there is. Super refreshing. Great price. Perfect taste. Definitely get a bottle.
--------------------
Simply lemonade and juices are just that, simply the best. I love all of the different flavor combinations. Their juices just taste so amazingly fresh and are good for mixing drinks as well. I can feel good about giving them to my kids too.
--------------------
My kids love This ￼lemonade. Especially because has only 120 cal for 8 ounces. The taste is very good and they love the socks that taste like real lemonade is all natural is very refreshing. I recommend it it
--------------------
This is one of my daily cravings. I enjoy the tart taste followed up by the sweet. It isn’t expensive and there are larger bottles incase you don’t want single servings. I haven’t ran across another lemonade in a bottle that hits by taste buds as much as this one.
--------------------
Definitely my favorite lemonade. Very fresh tasting with natural ingredients. Not too sweet or too sour.
--------------------
Really great lemonade but my only con is that this kind is almost too sweet. I mix this with my herbal tea sometimes & it tastes good that way.
--------------------
Great quality in juices and lemonades, the flavors are so refreshing and tasty . They are pricey though.
--------------------
This is an amazing brand. Not only this product but also all the products of this brand are amazing. I wasnt unhappy with this purchase as i wasnt with any other product of this brand. You guys should definetely give it a try. I know you wont regret and be happy just like me.
--------------------
It is good. Not too sweet, not too tart. Love simply beverages. So good. Much thirst quench. Many wow! Packaging is great. Slim and fits in door.
--------------------
I’m typically not a huge fan of lemonade but every now and again I do enjoy a glass of simply lemonade is a staple in my house my son and husband will drink a bottle in 2 days top
--------------------
This brand is amazing! This lemonade is delicious! I feel like I could drink it in one setting! Sweet, tart, natural, and the price isn’t bad!
--------------------
I love this lemonade, its refreshing, has little pulp, and I even enjoy the lime maid as well with Tequila
--------------------
It taste like real squeezed lemonade. I really love this product and so does my kids.
--------------------
Pretty good lemonade. Not too sweet and not too sour and can’t beat the price of either!
--------------------
Great as an alcohol mixer or just something sweet to drink. I use it for mocktails on mew years
--------------------
It is the brand when you think of lemonade . I love it. Always good and reasonably priced.
--------------------
This is my favorite! Taste like fresh squeezed lemonade. I like the pulp too. If you are a person that does not like pulp then you will not like this. But it is sweet and tasty.
--------------------
My favorite bottled lemonade! Has just the right amount of sweetness and tang. The bottle is a nice serving size
--------------------
So good! I love and live for this brand for any type of lemonade and orange juice. I’m definitely a repeat customer, and I recommend this brand to others who love those too.
--------------------
we as a family love simply , any time we can get away with no added sugar juice to our little ones we are happy. our kids love this juice . they should be spokes kids for this juice . amazing brand and me and my husband love to drink it too.
--------------------
This is my favorite store bought lemonade. If I’m not making it myself, this is what I’m going to but. Great flavor and not overly sweet.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite drinks. It's not too sweet and it's so refreshing. I think it almost tastes homemade. I always use a lot of ice and it still keeps its flavor.
--------------------
This is so refreshing! It's also a healthy option. One of my favorites! It's good to use in mixed drinks!
--------------------
Tart and sour and not too sweet. By far the best store bought lemonade and my go to. I think it taste the closest to homemade
--------------------
This is my sister and I’s go to lemonade! It’s so delicious and affordable and it tastes like freshly made lemonade. There is pulp but I actually don’t mind it in this lemonade because it’s just so good!!
--------------------
I felt like it had a lot of sugar and it was sour for my taste buds. Would definitely add more water to make this drink drinkable.
--------------------
I love lemonade and simply lemonade is my favorite brand. It honestly taste very nice and doesn’t taste too sweet or bitter. It also doesn’t cost tons of money at all and I’d most definitely buy this product again. I highly recommend
--------------------
Simply Lemonade is the best store-bought lemonade you can get! It is so convenient that it comes in single serve bottles and it isn't very expensive either. The bottle and lid are nice and sturdy so you don't have to worry about any spilling. I will continue to buy this lemonade when I need something refreshing to drink.
--------------------
I love the refreshing taste of lemonade anytime. The flavors are great they don’t have that taste of tartness in them.
--------------------
Not too sweet not to tart! Perfect size to through in my handbag and drink while I am out. The price is a little high for the size so I only purchase as an occasional treat. The bottle is very simple and study to avoid leaking. In comparison to other lemonades, I prefer the taste of this one compared to most.
--------------------
Just about the only pre-mixed lemonade that actually tastes like real lemonade and not some artificially flavored or overly processed (such as Minute Maid). It’s nice that it comes in a single-serve size, it makes it great for travel.
--------------------
Simply the best lemonade you can buy at the store! The perfect sweetness, but not to sweet or tart. Perfect for drinking on its own or used in making the perfect summer punch! Only con is that it can be on the pricey side, so I usually only get it as a special treat.
--------------------
I love Simply Lemonade it’s like drinking freshly made. Refreshing and not too sweet or sour, it’s also a great mixer for an adult beverage.
--------------------
My absolute favorite lemonade and drink in general. It has a great taste and leaves me very refreshed. I would definitely recommend.
--------------------
I love the fresh taste in Simply Lemonade. It's the perfect amount of sweet without it being overly sugary.
--------------------
Tastes like lemonade, even homemade. However there is so much sugar and you can definitely taste it. Not my first choice
--------------------
I'm not a fan but it does the trick. If you like orange juice I would get it from supermarket. I'm not sure of the price. Less sugar would be good. Often tastes super sweet.
--------------------
It's a pretty basic lemonade, and you'd think that wouldn't be hard to mess up but it really is. However Simply has not messed up. Their lemonade is just the right balance of sweet and tart, and in a variety of sizes it's one of my go-tos when I'm also grabbing a supermarket lunch counter special.
--------------------
This lemonade is super yummy! It’s even better frozen because it becomes slushee like. It is pretty sweet lemonade so if you don’t like super sweet this may be a little too much for you but I love sweet!! And love this!! It’s my go to!
--------------------
I use to love these lemonade drinks but now I often make my own organic lemonade. You have more control of how much sugar or put sugar alternatives.
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite.If it’s not available I would rather go with out!!It’s not from concentrate.It taste delicious,it’s refreshing..
--------------------
Simply Lemonade is pretty good. Not my go-to lemonade but I like drinking it occasionally. I love the taste
--------------------
Lemonade is my favorite drink of all times. This lemonade does not taste like soap (many other lemonade bramds taste like soap), amd is very refreshing. You will always find Simply Lemonade in my fridge :)
--------------------
It is alright for a bottled lemonade. I find lemonade like this to be too sweet and artificial tasting. Drinking this has really made me appreciate making a big jug of lemonade with fresh squeezed lemons. If you want a drink STAT, it isn't too bad.
--------------------
This drink is very addicting! It has the perfect tartness level for a lemonade without being too sour. Great for summer time!
--------------------
A little plain, but my favorite bottled lemonade. No filler ingredients, and not too sweet like it’s filled with sugar. Yes it does have sugar in it but it’s lemonade. Nothing bad about it at all. Just good lemonade.
--------------------
This brand has the best juices! They are full of flavor. They are very reasonably priced also. Love drinking the juices on a hot summer day.
--------------------
Perfect for on the go when I want something sweet but a little sour! One of my favorite lemonade brands!
--------------------
Absolutely my favorite lemonade ever! Tastes so refreshing and sour, which is how I personally like my lemonade. I just wish there was an option for "pulp" or "no pulp" with the lemonades like they do with the orange juice. Yes I would buy again, this is one of my favorite brands :)
--------------------
Is there anything that the Simply brand can’t make delicious? Best lemonade ever. It’s sweet but not overpoweringly sweet like some others I’ve tried. It tastes great alone and mixes well to make a delicious Arnold Palmer.
--------------------
It’s so refreshing. My family love this. I use this make popsicle for the little one in the summer.
--------------------
Simply is always been a brand I would go to if I want a fresh taste fruit juice, I love how they also have a simply smoothie which is delicious as well. I’m in love with the orange juice , I drink a whole bottle of the 13 oz in a day.
--------------------
this all natural and tastes just like I squeezed the lemons in my kitchen..very Thurston quenching and I use it in recipes as well
--------------------
This is my go to drink during the summer months. It's cool and refreshing. It is not to start and not to sweet. It's the perfect amount of both
--------------------
Absolutely delicious. Perfectly quenches the summer thirst￼. Taste freshly squeezed just like grandma use to make. Last in the fridge for a decent amount of time once opened. Only down side is it doesn’t come with a elephant ear like at festivals. Lol
--------------------
This one is great to share or if we are going somewhere. I can sip at it for a long time.
--------------------
Simply lemonade is my favorite go to lemonade. It’s not too sweet, it’s natural, and also the kids love it. I choose this brand over any other brand of lemonade. I would definitely continue to buy.￼
--------------------
This is my favorite brand of lemonade. It is delicious and it is so tasty and the packaging is great. I would not change this product at all I love it so much and I highly recommend it to everybody
--------------------
This is hands down the best bottled lemonade I have ever tasted. It is sweet and not to tart but not overwhelming sweet
--------------------
Such a cute little bottle but just enough lemonade for on the go, in your lunch box or even throw it in your purse! I take them to work, and my son packs them for school lunches. Super refreshing and gets you through the day when you’ve just about has enough.
--------------------
This is about as close to home made lemonade that you can get off the shelf. It’s not too sweet either.
--------------------
It’s simple, crisp, sweet and refreshing. I love that there aren’t unnecessary ingredients and it’s a great mixer! I recommend this but wish it was a bit less expensive.
--------------------
The perfect mix of both tart and sweet! It wasn’t tart enough to make you pucker up, but just right that it makes you wonder how have you never noticed that lemons where this tart
--------------------
Love this when I have places to go I can just buy one and go, the flavor is awesome and not too sour, nothing needs improved, good price for the flavor, I love this drink and buy all the time :) best drink
--------------------
Definitely recommend this brandSimply Lemonade 135Oz. Convenient, refreshing, and delicious-all the things a good lemonade should be!
--------------------
Love the taste of this lemonade! Tastes just like homemade. Best lemonade on the market. Would not improve, tastes great as is. A little on the pricey side, but worth it for the convenience. Would definitely recommend to others!
--------------------
I usually buy these at local convenience stores on hot days I’m out and about getting errands done has a great taste but not my first choice.
--------------------
Close to homemade and real lemon taste. Great for gatherings and on the go hydrating
--------------------
Simply Lemonade is not overly sweet or unnecessarily tart, making it the perfectly balanced lemonade that you desire on a hot summer day. It’s especially great for mixing with alcohol, it adds a nice flavor without being overpowering! It can be a tad pricey, but that’s my only real complaint... Thankfully it’s easy to find at a variety of grocery stores. And best of all, it comes in several different flavors as well! The raspberry lemonade is probably my favorite!
--------------------
It’s a very tasty product￼ and it is my favorite beverage but Only if it’s chilled are you like the simply lemonade and then just simply lemonade pink one it is the best I would highly recommend it and I will buy it again￼
--------------------
My favorite lemonade! Great by itself or used for a mixed drink. Well priced. Will always buy again!
--------------------
Pretty cool, sweet and tart and refreshing. I’m only giving it 4 stars because i just really like the limeade better. It is pretty good though.
--------------------
Another classic lemonade. Can't go wrong with this choice! Light and refreshing and not too sweet! Not as tart as a homemade lemonade as I personally like but still good!
--------------------
A little too sweet for me on this one. Has a good taste but I prefer the more sour lemonades. But if you prefer one that’s more sweet I would recommend this one that they have. But if you’re into sour it might not be your type you would like.
--------------------
Perfect for me. I be love drinking this all year around. No other lemonade can compare to this. This brings Life to me
--------------------
For a bottled lemonade, this is Simply the best. It tastes freshly squeezed and homemade. On a hot summer day there is no other drink I would rather have. Its a little pricey but worth it. It also tastes great with vodka or rum. So go out and buy today
--------------------
Simply Lemonade is my absolute favorite summer drink, but I love alllll their juices! I drink their high pulp orange juice year round.
--------------------
I do not like this product. Its tart and doesn't taste natural at all. Most of the Simply products are very tasty and natural tasting, but not this product. I don't recommend if you're an avid lemonade drinker.
--------------------
Extremely tasty and not too expensive. On par with other brands you can find at the store. It’s a little on the sweet side, but nothing overbearing. I do prefer a more sour lemonade which is why I lean towards Florida Naturals Floridas Natural Lemonade 59 Fl Oz
--------------------
Refreshing and perfect for hot Texas summers. Great natural flavors which makes it hard to beat. Perhaps offer in the larger jugs similar to the Simply Orange Juices.
--------------------
Such a yummy lemonade! Always refreshing on a hot day- plus it tastes freshly squeezed! Only wish there was more in a bottle ;). Overall, great product— definitely pick one up whenever I am craving lemonade.
--------------------
Amazing beverage. The best lemonade brand in my opinion. Perfect on a hot summer day
--------------------
Love the flavor of this and that I know most of the ingredients. I wish it had less sugar, but it is lemonade after all. Mixes with everything and nice and refreshing
--------------------
So refreshing and delicious. I love the tangy but sweet flavor. Definitely a treat though for me because of how sweet it is.
--------------------
I love this lemonade and all of the Simply drinks with the Peach and Watermelon being my favorite. I love this lemonade and it is so refreshing and has a great taste to it. I buy this every time I go to the grocery store and will continue to purchase it. I recommend this drink. It is great on a hot summer day.
--------------------
One of my favorite lemonades to grab on the go. The perfect amount for a hot day.
--------------------
Best lemonade. Granted, a little tart, but has awesome amount of pulp and balance of flavors. Delicious & tastes the closest to homemade, natural lemonade as opposed to the other brands.
--------------------
Refreshing. Delicious. I try not to look at the labels to know how bad things are for me. Could be full of sugar but it’s delicious so it okay. In moderation of course. To much of anything is bad
--------------------
so refreshing and not too sweet, also perfect to add to a mixie on a hot summer day.
--------------------
SIMPLY LEMONADE HAS A NICE TART FLAVOR TO IT. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, THAT IT DOES NOT COMPARE TO REAL LEMONADE. THE TASTE IS STILL ARTIFICIAL.
--------------------
Umm yes please!!! I love this lemonade so much! I've tried a bunch of flavors and love everyone. This has an authentic lemonade taste, unlike other brands that have a weird fake taste.
--------------------
Delicious. Simply lemonade is the best lemonade that is not overpoweringly tart. Perfect to mix with sweet tea.
--------------------
I love all the Simply products. Always the perfect amount of sweetness and flavor. Never tastes artificial. Pricier compared to other brands but well worth the few extra cents. Easy to find in stores.
--------------------
So tasty I love this drink so much. Super affordable & it stays good for a while. I love them
--------------------
This stuff is good. Taste great perfect mix between sweet and sour. It's cheap and you can find it every where
--------------------
Good taste, more of a bitter sour taste than some others that are sweeter and barely taste like lemonade
--------------------
Taste just like juice kid don’t even know it has no sugar!
--------------------
it's sickening how they advertise these for kids and people to buy and make it seem healthy when one of the ingredients is sucralose. sucralose can cause cancer..
--------------------
My son is a juice addict, and I thought for sure he’d notice these were “different” (sugar free), and turn them down. He doesn’t bat an eye at the taste, though, and likes them just the same as sugary juice. I feel much better giving him these. And they’re a great price!
--------------------
very happy for the sugar free options right now because that is something that me and my family are trying to keep an eye on, and it's still the same great taste
--------------------
I have always loved tropical fruit punch koolaid. Even as an adult I love this sugar free flavor!
--------------------
My kids love this stuff. They can't believe it doesn't contain sugar. Great product. Will be trying other flavors.
--------------------
My kids go crazy for this Kool-Aid. They literally can't even tell that it is sugar free. Which is great because my daughter has diabetes. This product is a very good value for the price. I would recommend it to anyone. Try it today! #Kool-Aid #fun #summer #yummy #foodie
--------------------
We love the zero sugar mixes! I can appreciate you just pour it in with some water and mix and its done! It still taste yummy and sweet but without all the extra sugar! I love this for my kiddos and will continue to buy it.
--------------------
This is a perfect product for your kids if you dont want them to have too much sugar. My kids dont notice much of a difference. Great value and price.
--------------------
I love this product its great for on the go water bottles. I like how there is a variety of flavours.

We love these Zero Sugar Tropical Punch Kool-Aid packets. Add one packet to two quarts of water. These are great for diabetics or anybody that wants to use less sugar. They taste great just like the Kool-Aid that you put a whole cup of sugar in. It is also a zero calorie drink. Kool-Aid Jammers Zero Sugar Tropical Punch Drink Mix

This is my favorite kool aid flavor. It has zero added sugar which is great and it tastes so refreshing and fruity.

We buy alot of Koolaid Zero sugar tropical punch flavor packs. It's so easy to use and convenient to take anywhere. They're pretty cheap and gives water a great taste
--------------------
These are so delicious! They are affordable and easily found at any local grocery store.
--------------------
These are good for when I'm tired of water and want something sweet without the guilt. I usually buy the single packs and they only cost $1 per box. I always buy these at Walmart or Heb. I like this tropical flavor and also the cherry one. Stay away from the sour flavors they are not my favorite.
--------------------
Refreshing and full of flavor. Nice fair size packages at a great price. Would not change
--------------------
This has always been a favorite ever since I was a kid and my kids love is just as much.
--------------------
It tastes just like regular kool aid . We buy em sometimes for water bottles its easy you can just put em in the water and shake it up. Its a good price and a good product . I would buy again for sure .
--------------------
I really do like them. Great to carry in purse for a quick flavorful drink on the go. Easily accessible and easy to prepare. Taste great
--------------------
I love the kool aid jammers zero sugar drink mix. My kids love it as well, its perfect for on the go as well.
--------------------
Kool aid is such a good drink for children and adults it also has so many good flavors
--------------------
I mean who hasnt tasted kool-aid? Everyone has. This has been something we drink since I was like 5 and I still love it.
--------------------
Love this!! Really refreshing and great taste! Not watery at all and easy preparation. Let sit in fridge before drinking.
--------------------
I'm so glad these are zero sugar. We dont give my children much juice but still want them to feel included so these are a great alternative. My only complaint is they are so HEAVILY dyed with food coloring it stains everything. Very very annoying to clean.
--------------------
I was worried about Zero Sugar Koolaid. When I was a kid, we put a ridiculous amount of sugar in our Koolaid lol. Honestly, the zero sugar is better than the regular Koolaid. I have no idea how, but even my kids prefer the zero sugar to the regular Koolaid.
--------------------
Every month we buy like 3 of this we put them in the water bottle and ready to go love it
--------------------
These taste very good. I use them often. They have a strong flavor. Only thing I don't like is how sweet it is.
--------------------
These are amazing!!! I love kool-aid and having these to make single bottles are awesome!! I would highly recommend these to anyone that just wants to add flavor to their water or to use these for kids to have a drink!!!
--------------------
These are amazing! I'm in love with all of the kool aid zero sugar flavors but even more so I'm in love with the sour ones!
--------------------
I like this when i need a fast drink solution for my kid. I like the zero sugar option. It's a bit bitter taste but I like the container convenience. Easy to store. Is average price not pricey at all. I like all different flavors and I can decide if to add sugar or not. I do recommend it.
--------------------
This is so good and it also comes in the packets which we use a lot. You cant even tell these are the zero sugar ones when you taste it.
--------------------
I was so stoked to see these with no carbs, but the taste is very different than the original Tropical Punch flavor. It's also blue instead of red which obviously doesn't matter, it just surprised me. Overall, they're not terrible, and I may repurchase just as a little carb-free treat, but I'm kinda underwhelmed.
--------------------
Out of all the flavours of kool-Aid Jammers always go for the tropical punch.. taste the same even with zero sugar ... although never hurts to add your own obviously !!(which i do)
--------------------
This stuff is amazing. It doesn't have any kind of after taste and isn't overly sweetened with artifical sweetener. It actually takes me back to when I wa in kindergarten and we'd have this flavor of kool-aid during snack time. It's funny how things can bring back memories like that. This zero sugar also makes me feel good about not drinking any sugar and it helps me get all my water in for the day. Great stuff.
--------------------
We love Kool-Aid Jammers Zero Sugar Tropical Punch Mix. Variety of flavors taste great and the kids love it as well. I have no complaints when I make this juice drink. I am a repeat buyer and am satisfied with my purchase every time.. For a nice summer recipe grab an ice pop tray make your choice of flavored Kool-Aid add pieces of fruit of your choice then add Kool-Aid add a stick and pop in freezer for a nice summer cool down.
--------------------
I absolutely love the taste of this. Very delicious and quite amazing as well. I do believe the price point is very fair! I would very much so recommend this product to anyone! Im sure a lot of people would enjoy
--------------------
This is a super delicious drink I absolutely love this , it has nice packaging, I would recommend it to everyone
--------------------
I absolutely love these! It's like Kool-aid with out all the sugar and it tastes the same. Great for diabetics like me who can't have sugar. Plus great for kids. Great for the price. I'd recommend this.
--------------------
It is the best I have come across my grand kids will only drink this. and I can control the sugar that they get.
--------------------
Such a great mix especially for the summer! Its an easy way to make drinks especially for big get togethers or hangouts. The instructions are easy to follow and it makes delicious juice
--------------------
This product is grate and sugar free and affordable it meant my expectations I love this product it taste so good
--------------------
Good for the kids because it has zero sugar, very affordable and it last a while, works better for me if I make a gallon, putting it in water bottles makes it taste like it has allot of sugar, Ive been buying these for years, I would buy again
--------------------
Zero sugar is the best. Yeah, it may not be AS good as regular Kool-aid but it is healthier and almost tastes the same.
--------------------
I love that it its sugar free! My kids enjoy the regular kool-aid but I stopped buying it because of the amount of sugar. Once I saw the sugar free, I had to get it! No after taste, no weird taste, still delicious and refreshing
--------------------
This drink mix is so good. So refreshing on a hot summer day. Very affordable and a great addition to water.
--------------------
The zero sugar Kool aid is great tasting and reduced sugar means I am keeping my family healthier. It is conveniently packaged and easy to make.
--------------------
We love kool aid! No matter the flavor but this is probably our familys favorite. Price, quality and flavor are always great and sugar free makes it just a tad healthier! Great for mixing up a gallon for a party
--------------------
Does not taste very good. Tastes way too “sugary” and has a bad after taste. Good alternative if you are diabetic, not good if you have options.
--------------------
Sweet drink without the sugar. Easy to make as well just open the little packet and pour into bottle of water and shake and youre done.
--------------------
This taste like childhood! Taste just like eating lemon cookies and koolaid in the church nursery. Its my absolute favorite go to koolaid. Its zero sugar so its presweetened. I love it! If you havent tried it I say go try it now!
--------------------
I love this product it taste yummy I love making kool-aid for my kids it I love all the different flavors they have of them I would recommend them
--------------------
I love these it's like getting your cake and eat it too especially when you're Quito a love how a lot of these M0 carbs they are so great it takes you right back to childhood
--------------------
My son loves kool -aid but I refuse to give him the one with all the sugar . So I picked this one up and it was pretty good . He enjoyed it
--------------------
This is another win for a diabetic family member! You can for sure taste the difference but not in a terrible way. I have already re-bought them again and will continue to! These and the other 2 flavors are pretty good, you should defiantly try!
