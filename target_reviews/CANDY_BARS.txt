Love the option to have different types of chocolates.. S'mores and two others to enjoy.
--------------------
Purchased to make gift baskets up for our local Post Office. Excellent quality and very affordable!
--------------------
The perfect selection of chocolate bars enjoyed by not only my fianc√© but my nieces and nephews as well. Due to the Pandemic, my nieces and nephews were precluded from Trick or Treating, so I provided them with these candies to their absolute delight. This box was well worth the price.
--------------------
Candy is always great! Loved the quick readiness of my pick up order.
--------------------
Great different options
--------------------
Perfect for Halloween Trick or Treat Give away
--------------------
Great price for full size bars for Halloween.
--------------------
Peanut butter cups had melted at some point and reset into a blobby mess. Real quality control issue. Threw entire box in the garbage.
--------------------
They are all melted. I was supposed to recieve my package on Wednesday but I didn't get it till Friday. On the day I was supposed to get it I got a email saying it may be late. I should have got that message the day I ordered so I wouldn't have been sitting around waiting on it. Not satisfied at all
--------------------
It would probably be good if it were not over a year out of date, I won't eat this it has an expiration of 7/18, I'm a little miffed that no-one checks the dates before they ship it.
Oh Well, sometimes you're the bug, sometimes your the windshield.  Gave to my neighbor Mikey, he eats anything..
--------------------
The price was great.  The price of a single candy bar in my hometown is 1.29 each so for 12.59 for 18 candy bars was great price and my dad (whom I bought them for) LOVES them
--------------------
My family and I really enjoyed this box of candy on our vacation
--------------------
Delicious candy bar assortment that we know and love. I lovd the variety pqvks because i can buy my favorites in bulk and eat what i want when i want it.

The overall candy was great, I'm not a huge fan of Hersey's by itself, but the KitKat and Reese's were great.

--------------------
The Kit-Kats were my fave as always. They were crisp and fresh and the perfect size for a sweet little pick me up. The Reese's were also delicious- tender and fresh. A tried and true duo, chocolate and peanut butter are quite a delectable pair. Hershey bars have always been a little boring to me, because they're so uniform. I like to have a little bit more texture. But the Hershey bars were nonetheless fresh and tasty. They make great s'mores! Overall I was very delighted with the selection and the freshness of the candy.
--------------------
This assortment package contains all my favorites; Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, Kit Kats and original Hershey's bars. I love using the Hershey's bars to make s'mores (even in the winter, I just use the microwave). They are the best chocolate to use because they melt perfectly. The Peanut Butter cups and Kit Kats are perfect on their own! These are a great snack when I need a sweet pick me up.

Our Hershey's assortment arrived in excellent condition and fresh and right on time to fill the Christmas stockings (after sampling some of course). All our favorite in one package: KitKat, Reece's and Hershey's. We liked it so much we've already ordered two more from online. Our family gives this assortment two thumbs up! Since we received

This assortment of candy chocolate bars was a huge hit in my house! We love everything Hershey's makes and I was pleasantly surprised to see this assortment of Kit Kats, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and Hershey's Chocolate bars in one package. They made for great snacks when we watched movies on the weekends, and I even snuck a few into our lunches during the weekend. Candy has always been a reward for good behavior in my house and this assortment is a great one to buy and be able to give out rewards when I see fit :)

Oh Hershey you outside yourself when it comes to chocolate, specially this assortment box. Nothing bad can be said about this chocolate, from the taste, to the texture to the packaging, everything is just perfect. The Hershey bar and KitKat are my favorite, and I want to thank you for making such excellent chocolates.
--------------------
Cannot go wrong with this chocolate bar. One of my all-time faves! Best used on s'mores, yum!
--------------------
I was pretty surprised how many different candy bars they were able to fit in this box. They packed very tightly and it really was all full of chocolate. I don't know how often the average adult eats a candy bar but with this box in the house we went through it very quickly. This would be a good size to bring into work or have on hand for trick or treaters. We enjoyed everything in the box and absolutely the whole thing. If they have this size container available in grocery stores by me I would buy it.
--------------------
What more can you ask for when you purchase this box? Milk chocolate, peanut butter and crispy wafers. There is something for everyone. I like how it comes in an assortment box giving you a choice. I like to keep mine in the freezer which helps to keep it fresh longer. It bar is a full size so you get a good value. All the ingredients are fresh which I expect from Hershey's. With this assortment box you get 6 each of Hershey's Milk Chocolate, Reeses Peanut Butter Cups and last but not least 6 KitKats. This has been a hit in my house. Highly recommend!
--------------------
Hershey's is one of the best chocolate companies in my opinion. I have been eating Hershey products my whole life. I really like the bar assortment because it lasts a long time and gives me a little bit of variety. I got to try this product for free in exchange for my opinion and now I think I will purchase my Hershey chocolate bars in this variety pack from now on. I would recommend this product for people who love chocolate and want the convenience of always having chocolate on hand.
--------------------
Great candy as always! Hershey's is always our go to treat
--------------------
I love Hershey's and the chocolate bars do not disappoint. The chocolate was smooth, melts in your mouth, and doesn't taste gritty like some bars. I also find Hershey's always taste fresh unlike some other brands I've tasted.
--------------------
Delicious chocolate!
--------------------
This chocolate is a yummy standard chocolate. Always tastes good. It doesn't have any frills but it's smooth and makes me happy. We used them to make some s'mores and they were great.

These are classic milk chocolate candy bars. They arrived in time for the Holidays which is a great time to dig in and treat yourself and everyone.

Came early today!!! Very thankful for that!!! This was for Christmas presents!!!!!
--------------------
these were amazing I used them to take camping everyone enjoyed them so much
--------------------
Great variety and price
--------------------
Liked that I could get assorted full size candy bars for a good price . I‚Äôm sure they taste good . But didn‚Äôt eat any yet . Using for something special .
--------------------
Who doesn‚Äôt love a big mix of chocolate candy?! This bag has it all. For someone who loves chocolate but also loves variety, this was a hit. The snickers was perfect when I needed something a little salty! Twix helped satisfy that crunch craving! Milky Way was perfect for when I needed a little caramel and Three Musketeers is just a good soft chocolate bar! I loved this mixed bag!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Perfect amount of candy for the price! This was great for Halloween this year since we got to treat our kids to their favorite candies!
--------------------
I gave these out on Halloween...Kids loved them...Price is right...$12.00...66 cents a bar...
--------------------
This was such an AWESOME delivery!! No surprise, my kids loved it - but, so did my hubby and I. We put some of them in the freezer, and used others crumbled up as toppings. You will not regret this buy!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

--------------------
This a good mix of chocolate to give out for Halloween. They are minis so you can confidently give multiples but also a variety so there will be the ones you want to eat and the rest to give away. Great little bite sized pieces when you need just a quick sugar fix. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This size is the perfect size , just enough to fulfill the urge for chocolate. Al the popular varieties , Snickers, Twix, and M & M's. Perfect for the Halloween trick or treaters. This size , the fun size is my favorite, enough to get it the perfect snack size, highly recommend for Halloween. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love SNICKERS, TWIX, MILKY WAY & 3 MUSKETEERS. They come in little packages and you can take a few here and there. My favorite of all time is three musketeers. They taste like the bigger candy bars but yet you don‚Äôt have to have a lot and you can save for later [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
All the classics in one bag! What is better than that? It's awesome to have the variety, and it's also great that they are not so large so you can have one of each if you're not giving them all away :) Individually wrapped, so they're good to go for Halloween! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I recieved this a few weeks ago and I (and my family in the house) DEVOURED this bag of candy. It was a decent sized bag and had a bunch of different chocolate candy bars and brands so it would be great for Halloween to hand out some chocolate candy and some sweet candy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
How could I even review these when they were gone shortly after I opened the bag? I barely got a chance to savor the crunch of a Twix as I licked the flavorful caramel from the top. I slowly bit through the thick mixture of Carmel and nuts as I enjoyed the texture of the Snickers bar. I closed my eyes as I snapped my KitKat in half to experience the layers of goodness as I bit through them. Was I dreaming? Is this real? Have I really eaten the whole bag?

my husband and I enjoyed our Halloween candy early this year. This mix was the perfect chocolate mix for us both. highly recommend for all chocolate lovers. I know what we'll be buying now for our trick or treaters. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I bought this because it gives me all the different mix of chocolate that I need. My kids love it and the quality is always there. These candy's do hold up to the heat as long as it is only briefly. Also keeping them in the fridge helps keep them fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I this one day while i was out shopping with the kids. They were asking for candy and would know it everyone wanted something different so I ended up finding this the price was good and it had a lot of the stuff they wanted [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
What‚Äôs not to love about the Mini Mix of snickers, Twix, Milky Way and 3 musketeers? My husband has an insatiable sweet tooth, so these treats were not safe in our home. I found the package next to his recliner. So much for Halloween. These really are the perfect size for when you just need a little something. Great variety of candy. Will be buying more.

I had to try each ad every one f my andy bars, I was pleased they are fresh, moist, and a great variety, I shared and the family was so happy you can pick up your own and decide your favorite. liked the twix buyt everyone had the one the believe is best.

This is my honest review for the Snickers, M&Ms & Twix Minis. First of all I'm a chocolate lover and the minis for just enough to fulfill that love. I like the fact that they come in the smaller sizes so they are sharable. I have a few kid's in my apartment complex, so I shared with them. They enjoyed them as much as I did. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I originally wanted this candy for Halloween, but my children got into it first. They were very pleased with the different candies that were in the bag. And i think it would be perfect for trick or treating children. I'll be purchasing more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
All of the candies that come in this variety are super yummy! That all seemed rationed out evenly. These one bite candies are perfect for small children or to satisfy your sweet tooth without all the calories of a full sized candy bar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I‚Äôm a chocolate lover and this bag is great. It has 3 of my favorite chocolates- M&M‚ÄôS, Twix and Snickers. They‚Äôre bite sized and perfectly sized. I can take them in my purse or save them to give to the kids. How can you go wrong with chocolate and such a nice assortment? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Candy was very tasty and bite size . They are perfect for a snack . They‚Äôre just the right size. It was sweet and the nuts in the snicker was delicious. i tasted a crunch in every candy bar. I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
As a picky easter I do not want a random mix of chocolate that I'm going to skip over half of, but this bag is incredible. It's all the good stuff and no junk! This goes quick in my house so I have to hide it or my husband would eat all the Snickers before I got home. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I bought this for the kids and they enjoyed and everybody had there favorite. Great size for kids and adults.The shipping was quick and the autumn theme was cute. I liked how there was a equal amount of candy and the wrappers didnt' have no mistakes . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
It‚Äôs great to have a bag of all our favorites. The convenient size is perfect for all our grandkids (and the parents). We always have candy out and the large size last long. They tend to eat them all so we know it‚Äôs a hit after a long weekend. I love M&Ms, Twix and Snickers so sometimes I have to hide a few.

Snickers, Twix, Milky Way & 3 Musketeers, Minis mix was a great selection of different chocolates. I loved the variety so I could enjoy a different taste whenever I wanted a sweet treat. It was great for days when I needed a quick snack for energy or just to reward myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this bag and the assortment is great. I eat almost every type except one. I leave those for my fiancee. Quality chocolate, perfect size piece if you just want a little snack. 3 musketeers just has a bit to much chocolate for me. I love the middle though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Snickers, M&M‚Äôs & Twix pack was fantastic for birthday party gift bags. The bag contains M&M‚Äôs in both peanut and plain. The Snickers are about a two bite size as is the Twix. There were plenty of candid in the bag so I was able to do gift bags for seven kids and still have some left over. It‚Äôs a great way to allow the little ones to have candy without it being too much. Moms are happy because the kids are happy. It‚Äôs a win win! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I got these a few weeks ago and they‚Äôre the best. All our favorites in one bag and the whole family is happy. I just wish they‚Äôd add a lil more Twix. It was nice they were fall themed. I always have trouble and usually can only find plain Or Halloween. will buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

OMG!! Who doesn't like candy!! I opened the bag right away and my family dug right in. It was fresh and soft and tasted great.

This was a perfect mix of my favorites. Everything was fresh and the right size bag for where I live for Halloween. Unfortunately the bag did not make it for Halloween. This is a smaller size bag so if you tend to not get a ton of trick or treaters this is perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This candy is awesome. The bag is big enough you get a variety of candy so you have enough to last awhile it‚Äôs perfect for snacking, parties or Halloween. The flavors are great they taste good and made well the brand is high quality I would definitely recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this candy to see what kind of candy I wanted to hand out to children this Halloween. This candy is the perfect size for Halloween. This candy is also tasty and filled perfectly, so you can have the perfect bite of candy. I also love that it is bite sized. It is good on a whim went you just want a bite of something sweet. It will also be good for younger children who tend not to eat all of there candy because of the size. It saves on wasted candy. I would recommend that everyone but this for Halloween because it is the perfect candy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Love this variety pack! Has a great mix of all of the classics. M&Ms both peanut and plain, Snicker's and Twix in a great mix of all. Great piece count and love that they are all fun size and not those tiny pieces. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I bought the SNICKERS, TWIX, MILKY WAY & 3 MUSKETEERS, Minis Mix Chocolate Halloween Candy Bag, 9.87 Oz for the family to enjoy. There is nothing better then this Mini Mix, it has everyones favorite chocolate in it and in nice bite size. I recomend this nice treat to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This candy variety bag is awesome. It has all of my favorite chocolate covered treats and all of them taste super good. The bag has twix, m &m's, peanut m&m's and snickers. I especially love that the twix have both RIGHT and LEFT bars. Another cool thing is that my bag had more than 55 pieces. I imagine that is an error, but still super nice. I originally wanted to rate this 3 stars, because the amount of candy of each variety is very inconsistent and no where near even. The bag had 9 packets of peanut m&ms, 22 snickers, 14 regular m&ms, and 11 left twix, and 2 right twix. If you are a snickers lover then this perfect for you! I opted to rate it 4 stars instead of 3 due to the 3 extra candy pieces in my bag. Overall, this is a great mix of candy, especially if you love snickers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Such a good buy for wanting something in the afternoon as a pick me up. My husband was surprised that they were actually full size bars. Would buy again
--------------------
Absolutely our Best Buy. This mix is finally the right one for our family. Too many times in the past I‚Äôve bought a snack sized mix bag of candy only to have one or two of the offerings eaten. This mix is great there is something everyone likes in our family and finally none left that no one likes. We will buy this one again and again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This has to be hands down the best mixture of candy chocolate around. The bag lasted me over a month with two of us in the home. It‚Äôs a great price and overall who doesn‚Äôt love chocolate! You can never get tried because there are so many options of candy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
What can I say?! This is just a wonderful mix of candies. Perfect bite sized pieces. I leave a candy bowl on my office desk and I am a hit with my coworkers. Yum yum yum! Everyone loves the classics! 50 pieces last for a while, highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Well the packaging is pretty straightforward - all the candies in this will be some kind of chocolate/caramel mix. I'm a big fan of both chocolate and caramel so the selection here was pretty much spot on for me. Twix and Snickers are pretty well known and most people should know whether or not they like them (I definitely do). The Milky Way Caramel was pretty good as well - it seems to replace the nougat in a normal Milky Way with just more caramel. I wasn't a huge fan of the caramel M&M's. They didn't taste bad but the textures felt a bit off with the thin candy shell outside - slightly firm chocolate shell within that - and then a pretty chewy consistency of caramel. Probably my least favorite of the pack. That all being said I would get this again just for the other 3 candies in the pack. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I esp love Twix and Milky Way. The small sizes are great for portion control. The mix is great-a favorite for everyone! The variety pack was a big hit and I would recommend it greatly! Good value for the bag. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I'm a caramel fiend! With the recent work from home orders, I bought this variety pack to keep around the house, making up for the snacks I was missing out on at the office. Needless to say, this mixture hit the spot and I may have eaten the whole thing in 2 days. Time to reorder! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

If you love caramel, this is the perfect assortment bag! The bag does seem to contain mostly snickers; I wish there was a way to more appropriately give a more even amount of each candy. Bonus is that everything but the Twix is gluten free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is an absolute hit at my house with my family. The candy is just the ones that we love all in one. I love the portion sizes so that you can reward your children, but they not get a full size amount of chocolate. They also work great for lunch boxes and for when on the go. With the 55 pieces you have enough candy to last a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The bag has a nice mix of chocolate candies Snickers, M&Ms and Twix . All my family members and guests liked these chocolates so much and it ran out in no time.

I am a HUGE chocolate lover I get a sweet tooth for chocolate. This was definitely awesome to have whenever my sweet tooth acted up. I love how there are 5 different choices in the bag. I love to put them in the fridge or freezer to keep them cold and from melting. The small size is perfect for when you just want something small and sweet. So if you have a sweet tooth and love chocolate this is definitely for you!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Loved this mix! A little bit of everything peanut-y. Nice mix of snickers (regular and peaunut butter), and m&m‚Äôs (Peanut and peaunut butter). Loved this combo bag and will definitely be purchasing again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Mixed Mars Minis Size Variety Bag is a great family sized bag for those who eat in moderation or balance and simply want a light indulgent treat. One, here or there, would last a pretty decent span of time. However, if one is a chocolate lover, this bag will NOT be enough: (1) because this bag is a tease (they are minis!) and (2) because fifty pieces of candy can go quickly if one is sharing these things. Overall, I would always recommend Mars chocolate because it's the best, but this variety pack REALLY needs some Peanut M&Ms and may be some fun-sized candy and I'll be sold. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Ummm, yes. Would buy again in a heartbeat. Chocolate and peanut butter are a weakness of mine. LOVE peanut butter M&M's. Wish the peanut butter Snicker's was fun size instead of snack size, but that is the only thing to complain about. I just had to eat more than one to satisfy my craving...

--------------------
Well first off who doesn't love a good chocolate. I know I do especially when they are from fantastic brands that use only he highest quality ingredients. You can tell the quality of the chocolate by the taste and man these don't disappoint!! I am a sucker for quality chocolate and this variety bag has all my faves. The variety is fantastic with something for everyone to enjoy. The peanuts in the Snicker's are always tasty and crunchy not at all soggy. The Carmel in the twix and Snicker's just is amazing and oh so stringy and yummy. I like that it came with two varieties of m&Ms too as I enjoy switching them up. The size of this bag is even perfect to bring for a get together as it's huge or just to keep at home to nosh on when you feel the craving. Overall fantastic candy brands in this variety bag .

My whole family loved this bag of peanut and peanut butter Mars candies. It contained an assortment of Peanut M&M's, Peanut Butter M&M's, Snickers and Peanut Butter Snickers. I had never tried Peanut Butter M&Ms or Peanut Butter Snickers before. The M&Ms became my favorite. The only thing I didn't like was that the regular Snickers were the "fun size" but the Peanut Butter Snickers were just small squares, smaller than the regular Snickers. I'm not a huge Snickers fan, but thought the Peanut Butter version was good and would have liked them in the same size as the regular Snickers. All in all, a great back of candy if you're a peanut/peanut butter lover like me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love this assortment. Provides the perfect amount of sweet and saltiness. The M&M peanut butter tastes better than the M&M peanuts in my opinion. They remind me of Reese‚Äôs pieces but better since each bite has more peanut filling. Highly recommend peanut butter lovers to try this one out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

First, I want to talk about the shipping. This was shipped with three ice packs in an insulated(?) bag. This survived the Nevada heat without any problems!

Who in the world doesnt love snickers! Especially 48 full size snickers! When I opened the box the kids were ecstatic because they knew it was some kind of candy but it wasnt a candy they've had before! They looked up at me so confused, so eager! We dont eat chocolate often in our home but they absolutely loved their snickers! It was actually their first time trying! Some of the words that they used to describe the candy bar "chewy, I taste peanuts, and it's so yummy in my tummy!" All in all the snickers were a 5 out of 5 for them and I'm sure they are going to enjoy having them as a treat every now and then!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

These Snickers Holiday Christmas trees are the perfect stocking stuffer! All the flavor of your favorite candy bar in a fun and festive shape. They are nicely packaged in colorful, festive wrapping.

--------------------
I'm a chocoholic and I absolutely love the holidays, especially Christmas. I love finding festive items to share with my kids and really get us all in the holiday spirit. Chocolate is a family favorite and we love eating chocolate all year but it's something special about eating it around Christmas time. Snickers is a bar that, in my eyes, can do no wrong. It has the same iconic taste that I've always remembered and i love when they change it up for different holidays. The Christmas tree Snickers bar is new to me. I had initially thought it would have a tree on it but the actual bar is shaped like a Christmas tree. The wrapping of the packaging has those Christmas iconic and traditional green and red colors and then to open the wrapper and see a Christmas tree is chocolatey magic. I love the presentation of the bar. They kept it authentic but just made it into a Christmas tree. The taste is still the same and the experience is wonderful as always. This is definitely a great piece of candy to give to family, friends, coworkers, or anyone you feel would enjoy it, along with their holiday festivities. Simply delicious!!

I thought this was going to be like a regular snickers bar but just with a Christmas tree shape, it turns out is a little different, the chocolate cover is very thick which makes the filling a little thin you can barley notice any peanuts or nuggat it‚Äôs almost all caramel, don‚Äôt get me wrong it still tastes good, the size is perfect for little diy candy Christmas presents or stuffers I love the Christmas tree shape is so pretty [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Snickers chocolate Christmy candy tree was a delightful surprise. It tasted a little bit sweeter than the regular Snickers and didn't have enough peanuts like the Snickers normally do.

First of all, this 48 ct box of Snickers is super easy to open.

Each Snickers candy bar comes individually wrapped which I really like. They are the perfect size candy bar. The wrappers are easy to open too. I love Snickers candy bars. These Snickers have the best ratio of nougat, peanuts, caramel and chocolate. So delicious and satisfying if you're craving chocolate and nuts! This 48 ct box of Snickers are great for Halloween or other holidays, birthday party goodie bag filler, to eat for yourself or anything else you can think of. Super yummy!

Love snickers bars. I usually have the mini bars just for portion control....but the full size bar is great to have around and somehow seems tastier. The chocolate, nougat, caramel and nuts are just a combination that is yummy and goes together to make a great snack (or what I count for dessert). You'll be glad you have the large box around! If they last long enough, they will be great for stocking stuffers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Okay is it just me or does candy taste so much better in holiday like shape form?! These snickers taste so amazing. They are a little bit harder around the edges compared to your regular snickers bar but I think it adds to the uniqueness of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
As a confirmed addict of Snickers Bars, I was expecting the Snickers Trees to be exactly the same product but tree-shaped. However, this was not the case. The tree-shape was apparent, but on biting into the delicious chocolate tree, you are met with a caramel consistency, nougat and peanuts. The caramel is predominant, and so if you are expecting the traditional Snickers product, you will be surprised. I actually enjoyed this departure from the norm, and I am looking forward to sharing more of these with family and friends during the holidays. I sampled a pack of six 1.10 oz Snickers Trees which are packaged in Christmas colors. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am so happy to tell you all about the taste of a Snickers candy bar. They are so good when you want something sweet. The bar itself is thick and I find that a Snickers bar is very filling. You can tell they include good ingredients. I think that.most people love a Snickers bar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I am a big snickers fan. This is one of my absolute favorite candy bars. So I was excited to try these out. I was really disappointed in it. The packaging is really cute and very Christmas like. The snickers is of course in the shape of a Christmas tree with snickers on it. Which is cute for the holidays. Unfortunately, the candy itself just didnt have that snicker taste that I have come to love. The chocolate and nougat ratio was off. You taste more chocolate than anything. I almost thought it was a caramel only in the middle. The chocolate is thick, chewy and the candy bar itself is very sweet. My kids who normally like snickers and candy in general found it hard to eat one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The only candy I have ever bought. A snickers a day keeps the hunger away. I always have at least two snickers in the house for my pleasure. I will never buy anything but snickers. I share with my grandson when he shames me into giving him half. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Snickers are my fave! And this was perfect for Halloween. You got the sale price and a full size Snicker! Granted it is not the king size, but regular will do when you get the munchies for chocolate. It tasted fresh and came right to my door. I would buy these again!
--------------------
I have a personal love of snickers but I don't always want a full size. I also love to have them frozen. These single size snack versions are fantastic options that allow me to be able to bite through even while frozen and allow me to tactic my sweet tooth chocolate cravings [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I couldn‚Äôt resist eating the whole thing in one sitting. The chocolate melted in my Mouth and was delicious.... the paper pulls apart slowly enough which allowed me to keep paper on it while eating it. I highly recommend to others. They will be as pleased as me! Maybe even a bigger size will be better! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

What needs to be said about Snickers Minis? They have the best ratio of chocolate and "inside stuff". Nice bite size, portion controlled treat. Its well packaged and you get a nice amount for the deal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This bag of Snickers Minis came in real handy for my son's Birthday pinata. They were the perfect size to stuff inside the pinata and the party size bag was almost enough to fill it up. I have been a huge fan of Snickers since childhood and always remember my parents having a candy jar filled with these. The roasted peanuts, the delicious nougat & caramel under melt in you mouth milk chocolate is so satisfying. Best part is they are only 45 calories each. I highly recommend the party size bag of minis for all your party needs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I've always liked twix so I decided to try out this 10 oz bag and it was as good as usual. I had no complaints with these twix even though I was worried that they would be melted. because I ordered them in the summer but they were great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
When it comes to candy, Twix has always been a favorite. It combines all the parts of a perfect after dinner treat‚Ä¶ cookie, chocolate and caramel. The great part about the fun size is that I don‚Äôt feel guilty when I eat one or two compared to when I buy the full-size version and eat the whole thing. I like how they have made it a little fun with the left vs right sides. At Halloween, these are a favorite among kids in our neighborhood and always a hit with my kids anytime of the year when they visit. With all that said, you can‚Äôt go wrong with having a bag of these in your pantry!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Twix are amazing! They are my favorite candy bar, so making them fun-sized is a win-win in my book. Just enough to satisfy a craving, but small enough to not feel guilty about it! Perfect for the candy bowl at the office or to hand out for Halloween. 100% love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Tender, crispy shortbread; Rich, creamy caramel; Enrobed in a perfect layer of milk chocolate. Oh, and it's FUN SIZE! Just about the size of my pinky finger. Twix is a family favorite! What's not to love? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I keep candy on hand to share with coworkers (who doesn‚Äôt need a little pick me up during the day?). Twix is always a favorite. These are the perfect size for a midday pick me up. They are not the tiny minis that just won‚Äôt do, but are about as long as the palm of my hand. Twix is delicious. If you haven‚Äôt tried them, you need to. They have a cookie base with caramel on top, all covered in chocolate. So good. I have included pictures to give you an idea of size of this product in particular. Hope that is helpful!

--------------------
Twix has always been one of my favorite candy bars. The cookie crunch, mixed with ooey gooey caramel, covered in chocolate is candy perfection! This bag of Twix were especially good because I didn't have to share them. They paired well with a night of Netflix binge watching. They tasted fantastic, and will still remain one of my favorites. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got these and shared them with family ! Everyone lived them and had them gobbled up before the day was over! They are the perfect size for a quick chocolate fix and the caramel is ooey gooey delicious! The cookie was super crunchy to add the perfect bite of yumminess!

--------------------
Twix will probably always be my favorite candy. The cookie, caramel and chocolate are a perfect combination. The small size makes them an easy way to reward yourself without having a lot of guilt for eating too much candy. Although it is hard to eat just one!

Twix are always a great choice. These individually wrapped small bars are great to have around when you want something sweet. They are just the right size. I just wish they would make peanut butter TwIx in this snack size too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I absolutely love this Twix Caramel Fun Size Chocolate Cookie Candy Bar. I been a huge fan of Twix my whole life. Every size and flavor is so yummy. This by far is my favorite size. The And regular size would stay uneaten or just one eaten and kiddos wouldn't want the next one. But this fun sizes are so much fun and easy to eat that I can eat the whole bag in one sitting. My kiddos absolutely love it and are easy to take in there lunchbox. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Everyone knows Twix is my candy. The layer of cookie and caramel with a chocolate coating is the best of all candy worlds. The little ones are a good candy dose when when I need a sugar spike. The fun size are always nice to share, but I rarely do. My kid and the wife know they only got about two from the whole bag. I always keep a few bags in my semi so I can much on them while driving. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
When you have a sweet craving twix never disappoints. I ate twix as a kid and I swear it has only gotten better through the years. Me and the kids tried both the left and right twix and everyone acted like there was a difference in the taste and we voted to see which one was better. We had 4 people and 2 votes each so I guess they are equally delicious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
These snack size Twix bars are the BOMB!! I have always loved twix candy bars, but having them in the fun size is fantastic! I really like being able to keep these in my office for when I need a little pick me up. They are the perfect size for satisfying that little craving for sweetness. I can now have just a small snack without going overboard. These chocolate, caramel, and cookie bars are my absolute favorite go to snack! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I‚Äôm a chocolate lover, so the Twix fun size candy is right up my alley! I love the smaller size so that I can have just a small snack when I‚Äôm on the go. The individually wrapped candy is so convenient for taking with you in your lunch, or just to keep with you at your workplace for those moments when you just need a little snack. I love the combination of chocolate, caramel and cookie. It‚Äôs just the right amount of crispiness and chocolate goodness! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love Twix and I always have a hard time NOT eating both in the package. We love the snack size for our candy bowl. Perfect for a quick Twix without feeling too guilty about it. This would be perfect for Halloween or for anytime snacking! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
They‚Äôre Twix, and that‚Äôs all you need to say! What‚Äôs better than a cookie wafer, drizzled with caramel, then dipped in chocolate? Not much. They‚Äôre an American classic and they taste as good today as they did decades ago. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have to say I love Twix, they have everything you need a little crunchy, a little chewy and the chocolate to finish off. The fun size are ideal for the sweet finale to a meal or popped into the top of an ice cream, they are perfect. As for right side and left side i‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm a double agent!!! shhhh!!

We absolutely LOVE Twix, it is our weakness and these Fun Size bars are making it super hard to resist sneaking one, or three.

--------------------
I have a deep love for Twix bars! The taste of the cookies with caramel on them and the chocolate over that, is a match made in heaven!! These bars are packed with flavor and have a good amount of crunch without being too much. This fun size bag is great for portion control because sometimes it's hard to not indulge. I also like the campaign of the "Left" and "Right" twix and which one is better. It is a clever way to bring something new, yet simple to an old favorite. I personally recommend this bag to those who love Twix bars but can go overboard with eating them. The fun size bars give all the flavor and goodness of a full size bar and is something you can treat yourself to, no matter the time of the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
These are delicious, up to Twix's highest standards. Great size and perfect amount of filling and crunch to keep you satisfied. I would definitely get these again or bring them to a party with friends. They're hard not to eat all at once! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have a well known sweet tooth. That being said, Twix is a delicious way to indulge in my craving. I love the texture of biting down on the caramel into the soft, yet crunchy, cookie center. The chocolate coating is just the right sweetness without over doing it. Being a grown woman, I can't indulge in an entire candy bar without feeling guilty. These fun size bars are just enough to calm my sweet tooth at only 70 calories! Sometimes I put my Twix into the freezer an hour or so before eating for a frozen, chewy caramel center. Definitely one of my top 3 candy bars ever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Twix is my absolute favorite candy. The fun size bag is perfect for work and to take with me while I'm on the go. However I am strictly right Twix, so I made my husband eat all the left Twix. So I can't say for left Twix but right Twix was great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

--------------------
My kids and I love Twix candies, but I don't like giving them an entire candy bar each time they want a little treat. These are just perfect! They're large enough to satisfy their cravings while small enough to not make me feel so guilty in giving them a treat. I love the size of the bag as well, definitely shareable! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is a huge bag of Twix! My daughters like to argue over whether the left or right ones have more caramel. I don‚Äôt care - they are both tasty!

I usually never keep candy around the house, but I couldn't resist this time. Twix is the perfect snack when your sweet tooth is too strong to ignore. Just the right amounts of chocolate, caramel, and crunch. Can't get enough! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I've always been a fan of Twix, and these fun size bags are great for quick snacking or when you are on the go and don't want the temptation of finishing a full size bar. Love the caramel, chocolate and cookie combination and the caramel is not too gooey or sticky either. These bags are also very convenient for school lunches, Halloween trick or treating or just small daily rewards for children. I add 2 in my daughter's luch box as a dessert for school and she loves them. One or two can really satisfy my sweet tooth craving. Will definitely keep getting these fun size bags on hand and I'll be getting a few more for Halloween too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

These were a hit for our family. We pulled them out for dessert, and they were gone in a couple hours. I love the clever left and right labels on the bars. Perfect size for snacking and sharing.

These are just the perfect size for a craving and this size bag seems to last forever. I've ordered them twice now and they have arrive fresh and in perfect condition.

A long time favorite. Tasty milk chocolate caramel cookie is everyone‚Äôs favorite. ‚ÄúSilly rabbit, Twix is for kids‚Äù. The fun size makes it easy to share and a big Halloween favorite. I like the candy plus cookie combination! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Twix candy bars have always been a favorite in our household. Sometimes solid chocolate bars just feel like too much chocolate. That‚Äôs when I love a Twix. The mild cookie inside is the perfect contrast to the sweet chocolate coating. I love the variety of textures that explode in my mouth every time I bite into a twix. There‚Äôs the chocolate coating that just seems to melt into my mouth, the creamy smooth caramel that coats my tongue, and of course the nice crunch of the cookie at the very center of it. My husband loves the fun size Twix because they make a nice treat to stick in his lunch. He doesn‚Äôt always have time to eat a full candy bar during a break but he can easily pop one of these in his mouth on the go. I also love them for our daughters because full sized candy bars are too much for a toddler at once. They love when I hide fun sized Twix in the fridge for a nice cool treat on a hot day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
It has been many years since I have eaten a Twix. The chocolate is sweet and melts in your mouth. The caramel is soft and gooey, a nice contrast to the crunchy cookie center. I had to hide the bag from my family so I could sneak a few bars before they were all gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Despite how annoying those left and right Twix commercials can be - the candy bar remains a testament to taste! It hasn't been subject to updating the way some have. Still one of my favorites!

I could go on and on about Twix. It has the perfect amount of shortbread cookies, carmel covered in milk chocolate. I just wish they would make the snack size bigger or put two in a wrapper because before you know it you will have a pile of wrappers everywhere. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Our family loves caramel, there is just no way around that. Add to that a delicious cookie layer with caramel dipped in chocolate, even better. From the full size candy bars to savor and take your time with, to the minis you can pop in your mouth when you are on the go. You can't beat the delicious flavor. Twix just melt in your mouth a delicious mixture of a buttery cookie, chocolatey caramel. Just delicious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Twix caramel fun size 10.83 oz is convenient for on the go. Having the fun size candy bars individually wrapped is easier to take on the go when you only want to take a few pieces with you, without them melting. The size of these fun size bars were a bit bigger than I thought they would be since usual fun size are small squares , these bars look about half the size of a regular Twix bar.

Some of the bags of Twix give you the little tiny squares of Twix, not so here. This bag has nice sized bars, a couple of inches long each. Delicious Twix candy and a lot of it.

--------------------
Whether it's left Twix or right Twix, Twix is absolutely one of my favorite candy bars. The fun size portions are a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth without having to eat a whole candy bar.

I've been addicted to Reece's Peanut Butter Cups for as long as I remember. They have ALWAYS been my favorite. Back in the day my Easter Basket was nothing but Reece's. Lately though I've been disappointed. They taste nothing like they used to. I'm sure there was a recipe change but why? You took the best candy in the world and turned it into something that Im not sure I'll ever buy again. I'm disappointed and heartbroken.

Bought these thinking they‚Äôd be fun for kids, I even opened the bag and exposed individual pieces to light and there was no Glow, disappointing! No difference in contents.
--------------------
I can finish this pack in a day, love them
--------------------
So now, not only does the chocolate taste poorly, the center is like a hardened powder. Never buying these again which is truly a shame as they were always my favorite. Also, you can change the image on the wrapper, it does NOT look like that anymore.
--------------------
I've noticed a difference in the taste/texture of my most recent purchase of this product (Oct 18, 2020). Last purchase was approximately 2-3 months ago and did not notice this consistency at that time. The newer product has more of a waxy consistency which is neither good nor bad to me personally, but it is a noticeable difference. Have there been any recent formulation/manufacturing changes to the product? I know of others who have reported noticing a difference as well.

I bought about four packs of peanut butter cups for me and my sister who probably loves them more than anyone else in the family. So when I opened the first pack I see that they‚Äôre deformed and ugly looking but that‚Äôs not what matters because I still ate them driving back home. I started crying because even though they were deformed looking they were still so great. Also the cereal is really good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

What happened?! The cups I used to live taste awful. They almost have a gross honey taste to the chocolate. Our son gagged on one and we didn't know why (its his favourite), so we tasted one and we're shocked at how bad they were!! We had to spit it out! Please check your quality control!! A month prior we bought a package of minis and they tasted bad too - like cheap Easter chocolate (or worse). What happened?!? You need to start reading your 1-star reviews, there is a clear common theme here. Recall your affected products!!!!

--------------------
They‚Äôre crave-able and enjoyable in small doses but the actual quality isn‚Äôt super high. The combination of flavors gets cloying after more than two of them, and the chocolate gets crushed or distorted in this packaging easily. The core concept of a peanut butter cup is solid but Reese‚Äôs is no better than numerous other generic or premium brands. It‚Äôs fine, but I wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way for it.
--------------------
The classic peanut butter cup is perfect - please stop trying to come up with other types of this ! I tried the "thin" ones & was very disappointed. I think maybe the factory just ran out of peanut butter & someone decided....well, lets not waste the chocolate & see what we can do....

I just bought a bag of Reese's miniature cups and it seems like every cup has five wrappers on it and I'm very upset because I can't eat more than I want without choking on a wrapper!

This boi frozen got me actin stupid, outta my mind! If you've never tossed a Resse's in the fridge, then I feel sorry for you. Do it now! It's a once in a life time experience. When you open your eyes it will over before you know it. You'll wanna go back to the moment where you sunk your teeth into chocolatey, peanut butter goodness in cup form. S-L-A-P that's a Reese's.

My husband and I are almost daily consumers of wonderful traditional Reese's Cups. Something has happened to the flavor. This flavor change isn't pleasant and has been in several packages from different stores. Has the recipe changed or is this just a temporary problem?

What happened to the Reese snack size? I buy the Reese snack size bags regularly and the previous four bags I bought were terrible, no where near their usual delicious taste. Since these were so bad I reluctantly bought some from another store and they tasted great. What happened? My rating on those four bags is poor. I would not recommend Reese on those four bags.

I recently splurge and got a 12 pack. I figured I would have a yummy treat over the next few days and share with my son. When I opened the first one I noticed it was markedly smaller than I was used to. Disappointing but not a deterrent. Then I popped it in my mouth and noticed an unpleasant test. I thought it was a fluke so I ate a second. Nope. Maybe it was something on my hands. So fast forward a few days and I walked my hands so I could make sure nothing messes up my treat. But that unpleasant taste was still there. That'sa deal breaker for me. I don't care that they make me fat if they taste good. But these did not. Guess it will be good for my waist line!
--------------------
I bought a 35.6 oz bag of peanut butter cup miniatures and there is an unpleasant taste to them, is there a different oil or something in use in the recipe? It leaves a terrible after taste which ruins it for me. What a waste!

I've stayed away from the thins and the ones with Reese's Pieces in the cups, because who wants to cut down on the Reese's goodness!?! The regulars are still a go to any time. I think Hershey's needs to admit they have perfected this item and STOP messing with it! It has lasted as long as it has for a reason. For me, your regular Kit Kat bars are the same way.....though I do wonder what a Reese's cup Kit Kat would taste like!!!
--------------------
There is no better candy than a Reese's peanut butter cup! But, it is so disappointing to open the package and find your piece of candy has shrunk to half the size it used to be. So disappointing!!!
--------------------
The texture has changed and they taste gross. I dont know what ingredients the company has changed but the reeses cups taste horrible. Very poor quality lately

Who doesn't love Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?  There is never a time or a place that I wouldn't choose this peanut butter cup as my 1st choice for a snack option!  I always try and behave, but with this current situation I have found that I am more open to treating myself to one.  We have always had these in our 'snack bowl' for the boys and now have a stash in the pantry!
--------------------
One word, disappointed! 50 plus years of enjoying this treat. It was the amount of filling to the chocolate that made this treat most delicious back in the day. Not even close now. I'm out.

The changes made in how the chocolate and peanut butter are combined makes Reese's peanut butter cups UNACCEPTABLE! They no longer taste, or feel the same. You also have decreased their size. I'M NO LONGER CONSUMING THEM, YOU CAN KEEP THEM! What a shame when foolish corporate men get not so bright ideas. YOU RUINED THEM!!!
--------------------
My wife two sons and myself love Reese's peanut butter cups more then any other treat we have movie nights almost every night and it's something we always try and keep handy nothing better
--------------------
I don't know how anyone could leave a bad review because Reese's are amazing!!!! I absolutely love Reese's!!!! :) My fianc√© and I always fight over Reese's. I usually have candy at my house for guests and Reese's are always the first candy to be all ate up by guests. Reese's is always the most requested candy or treat people want me to buy. A couple of days ago I had bought a bag of Reese's eggs. Woke up the next morning and the whole bag was eaten by my fianc√© and his brother. I was genuinely upset that all the Reese's Peanut Butter eggs had been eaten up so my fianc√© gave me more money to go out and get another bag of Reese's Easter Eggs. Lol I don't play when it comes to my Reese's! Reese's Peanut Butter Cups has always been my favorite!!!!

Growing up this was a must have always. Whenever I walked into a store of some sort I would always leave with a Reese's. As a little kid I went on these long 8 hour road trips and you best believe I had a Reese's with me.

You made them thinner and your not sorry. Did you lower the price by the same amount that you cut the ingredients? Not from what I've seen at the grocery store. I'm no longer a customer. Thank you.

Purchased 2 large bags of Reese's peanut butter cups for a trip to go out of town with and was very disappointed that they were stale, like dry peanut dust. Usually enjoy your products.

Opened the package today and these are the driest inside of the peanut butter I've ever seen. The peanut butter was crumbling off and tasted terrible.
--------------------
It's the perfect ratio of peanut butter to chocolate. I crave these more than any other chocolate, any other candy. It's to the point my man questions if I love these more than him some days.

Reese's peanut butter cups are a fun and delicious treat. I love these individually wrapped cups that are easy to put in a lunch bag or snack on at home. I grew up with Reese's peanut butter cups, they are my mom's favorite, and still enjoy them as an adult and share them with my own family. These cups have the perfect balance of chocolate and peanut butter. I would recommend these to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I was so happy when I received The Peanut Butter Cups bc not only are they my absolute favorite I felt like it was Christmas when I received these in the mail. I've always preferd the Peanut Butter Cups over the Regular Reese's cups bc it was just enough Peanut Butter and Chocolate. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Chocolate and peanut butter, the best combination! Individually wrapped so you don't have to eat them all at once, but they probably won't last long if you share with friends. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to satisfy their sweet tooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Though personally I prefer the minis I will never turn down a reeces peanut butter cup.

--------------------
Loved the peanut butter cups they were so good . Milk chocolate with peanut butter filled ! My family and I enjoyed them so much!! Thanks
--------------------
The best chocolate for s'mores.
--------------------
This is a great pack for s‚Äômores.
--------------------
World's best chocolate! Our favorites are Special Dark and Symphony plain and just Hershey bars without nuts. BEST!
--------------------
I mean seriously, how can you go wrong with Hershey's? These are a pantry staple for us all summer long for making s'mores in our backyard. Half a bar per smore, no chincing out! And now that I can order these using Drive Up and Target delivers them right to my car, even better!
--------------------
Hershey's Milk Chocolate is a really good candy bar. Tastes really good. Very sweet. Less rich than other candy bars like Cadbury Dairy Milk.
--------------------
It is awesome, I eat it
--------------------
So tasty and yummy.
--------------------
This is without a doubt the worst chocolate I have ever tasted, how an empire was built on such a poor product boggles the mind!
--------------------
The Hershey factory is great and I think that you can always love the Hersheys bar!
--------------------
Love the bite size
--------------------
Who doesn't love eating the little Hershey's bars? We are big fans of Hershey Chocolate. These bars are just the right size too.
--------------------
My husband is obsessed with these chocolate bars! They were so delicious, we really enjoyed them. They kind of remind me of the chocolates my grandmother always brought us when she would come to visit, would give them 10 stars if I could!
--------------------
I've always loved Hershey's milk chocolate bars and always will. They're a staple! Consistently great!
--------------------
These are a classic! I loved getting these as a kid on Halloween. They're creamy, delicious, and great for a snack. You can't go wrong with these chocolate bars. They're easy to break off and eat. I love them!
--------------------
Rule number 1 - if you want to keep these do not leave anywhere but where you intend on hiding it because it will become community property and someone is going to eat one or all of them. Rule number 2 - these are those delicious chocolate bars... what's not to love... under no circumstances should you forget to get them for grandma for any and all occasions if you want to be remembered. When there are a lot of grandkids.... these chocolate bars = love! and finally Rule number 3 - if your girl friend is going through ANYTHING.... BRING THESE, flowers and offer to listen no matter how painful it might be for you..... you won't regret it! Just saying these Hersey Milk Chocolate Bars may be small but you can eat one now, toss one in your bag for later and still have one for a late night snack. It's the perfect size to not feel guilty and feel satisfied at the same time.
--------------------
You can't go wrong with this "go to" chocolate bar. Always good quality.
--------------------
Standard chocolate. I don't really like to eat it plain, but I used it to make s'mores and it was perfection. A little bit of melting goes a long way to something beautiful and delicious.
--------------------
abaslutly perfect for sharing or even just to put in your bad for a sweet treat during the day! Not to small and not to big. The size is just right for just the right amount of chocolate when your in need!
--------------------
Delicious reminiscent chocolate bars! They remind me of camping as a kid and are the best chocolate bars for s'mores! I will always buy these chocolate bars as long as they make them! So rich and creamy!!
--------------------
These are the best chocolate bars for s'mores? My family loves to take these chocolate bars with us camping as the individual pieces make it easier to break off only as much as you need and make amazing melty s'mores. I have tried other chocolate products but nothing compares to these Hershey bars!
--------------------
Delicious and melts in your mouth. It's heaven lol
--------------------
Pure milk chocolate to use in a variety of ways. It's been a staple in my household for years
--------------------
i loved the hershey's milk chocolate bars i love chocolate and this was one of my favorites
--------------------
Just the right amount of bars to share with family! Also a great size to use on smores.
--------------------
Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars is my favorite chocolate candy! This chocolate melts in your mouth. I love the smaller, bite size bars. It came in an 8 count package, so I was able to use it for stocking stuffers, the kids loved it. I did keep a couple for myself, they were so good!

--------------------
What can I tell you about Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars that you don't already know?? It's smooth and creamy, has the perfect chocolate taste and melts in your mouth like heaven! The only problem... It keeps disappearing!
--------------------
All my life nothing has changed with the original Hershey chocolate bars. These are perfect size for Smores!
--------------------
I love this candy bar! Hershey's makes the perfect chocolate for smores! I will buy again and again and again!
--------------------
Hershey's Chocolate is my absolute favorite chocolate! I have tried a couple of other brands of chocolate and in my opinion, nothing compares to Hershey's The chocolate is silky smooth, melts in your mouth and it does not have a harsh after taste. The Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars are great for a quick on the go snack! I will absolutely continue to buy the bars for my family!
--------------------
Tastes like smore time. Not my favorite candy bar but still tastes great. Plain milk chocolate for when you get a basic sweet tooth. Good quick snack size for needing just that little taste.
--------------------
I love Ice Breakers but am not a huge fan of the Arctic Grape flavor though, but it's just personal preference. Flavorful and long lasting Hershey's, yum! Love the snack sized bars. Perfect for a quick snack, great for kids and awesome for s'mores!
--------------------
came packaged of 16 bars - pretty good size - much to my surprise. I thought it was going to be super small bite sizes but no they were pretty decent sized bars. So if you like chocolate like me, these are a tasty item to get! Especially anything by Hershey's!
--------------------
These milk chocolate bars are simply delicious. You can eat them as a snack for a treat, or use them for desserts. Very versatile and many options. These are a pantry staple I do believe.
--------------------
Definitely good but not the best chocolate I've had otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. Satisfies the chocolate craving and good with Smores!
--------------------
Wonderful
--------------------
These chocolates are so good and great to pack as a treat for lunches
--------------------
The Hershey's milk chocolate bar is one of the best tasting on the market. Rich and smooth with a sweet creamy flavor. They are our families' go to for s'mores during the summer, for chocolate bark gifts at the holidays and we buy the fun size and put them in the freezer for a delicious frozen treat.
--------------------
Amazing!
--------------------
These little candy bars are perfect when you don't want to overindulge but want to feel like nothing has changed. These shrunk down versions of full size candy bars are perfect for helping you feel youre not sacrificing a thing.
--------------------
Old standby- perfect for s'mores!
--------------------
Milk chocolate is such a sweet spot for me and this little sucker was gone in 24 hours of me receiving it! There is nothing bad about a bar of milk chocolate :)
--------------------
Everyone's favorite. Come on who doesn't like a chocolate bar? We used ours for a backyard s'more party.
--------------------
Hershey chocolate bars!! Perfect for s'mores and that is exactly what we used ours for!! So gooey and delicious, the perfect summer time treat.
--------------------
Delicious as always
--------------------
I consider that the Hersheys brand of chocolates has a great variety of products where there are different options for different tastes. As a lover of chocolates I certainly loved and would buy these products. For your I would recommend Hersheys products because they are delicious and good quality.
--------------------
My children are really big fans of the Hershey's brand, especially the milk chocolate bars. They have been a regular purchase for us at our local grocery store even before we were selected to participate in this program. My kids love to eat them right out the wrapper and they also love to use them for summertime treats such as smores and sundae toppings. The chocolate is delicious and comparable if not better than more expensive chocolate brands. The pricing is excellent and I love that you can buy them in mini form, single bars or packs of the full size bars. I have and definitely would recommend this brand and specifically the chocolate bars to anyone who is a chocolate lover just like our family.
--------------------
Great little sweet snack

Makes great smores my niece is two and loved them i didnt get any lol
--------------------
The versatile bar that is not to big yet not too small. Perfect for quick treat, goodie bag, or just a small snack. Crowd pleaser that never lets down!!
--------------------
it has the right amount and it taste great
--------------------
It was so good! Best chocolate ever!
--------------------
They were ok. Definitely has more chocolate taste to me than any other candy. Pretty plain. You can do alot with it though. Melt and mix in milk for the perfect hot chocolate, or put into your pancakes for chocolate pancakes.
--------------------
My first candy bar, love it
--------------------
This product is heaven. I love this one!
--------------------
Delicious...M'est right in the s'more!We loved it at our party!
--------------------
Did the Kit Kat chocolate change? The chocolate tastes waxy and flavorless to me now. I had a Kit Kat from Canada earlier in the year, and it was MUCH better. Reluctant to buy again and it‚Äôs a shame because Kit Kat‚Äôs are one of my favorite treats.
--------------------
Man this candy bar is a life saver. If you have a sweet tooth one week and then a week later, you have enough of the candy bar to save until you have that sweet tooth again. Love it!
--------------------
Addictive and my favorite ever! Have been waiting my whole life for this. Lol would pick big Kit Kat over my husband ‚ôÄÔ∏è
--------------------
Nothing gets me more excited than eating a Kit Kat Bar. Their taste and texture are absolutely unbeatable, and they are absolutely delightful to break open and eat. I'm always excited around Halloween, because not only do I get to splurge on regular Kit Kat Bars, but I also get to buy the dark chocolate Kit Kat Bars. One item on my bucket list is to visit Japan and try as many Kit Kat Bars as possible. The last time I visited L.A. I brought home several bags of the Green Tea flavor. I brought them into my office and they were all gone before lunch.
--------------------
Just at a mini kitkat that was all chocolate, no cookie inside. Even the production machines aren't perfect. Just letting you know. Still love them though.
--------------------
These little KIT KAT Assorted Candy Bars are the bomb. I get my sugar fix and you have three varieties of milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white chocolate..
--------------------
My family enjoys devouring these Kit Kat miniature Assortments regularly. There is really something for everyone! My husband is obsessed with the white chocolate, im obsessed with the dark chocolate, and my kids like the regular milk chocolate Kit Kats. I can not remember a time where Kit Kats were not in our lives. They are the perfect size for a tiny snack, or a great dessert.
--------------------
I love the assortment you get in this bag. This is perfect for everyone in the family with different tastes. I like to add these to baking or just as a quick pick me up snack on the go.
--------------------
These are so delicious. Such a huge bag too! My personal favorites was the dark chocolate. Perfect size for bite size snacking!
--------------------
I loved every single Kit kat that was in this package. It was nice and smooth to the very last bite. There is truly nothing better than a classic kit kat bar. If there is one thing in this world that you can not go wrong with, it is a Kit Kat bar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is my favorite Kit Kat Product. I love to remove the wafer layers when eating. They are great to keep in my fridge as a week end "reward." I have to hide these from my husband, though, because they go fast. It is very hard to eat just one bar. I will be rebuying and would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have always enjoyed this size kit Kat even since I was a child. It is the perfect size to share or eat some and save the rest for later. I was not aware there was any type of sampling box but when asked to do this I was very excited to give my opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Because they (here Hershey's) has mentioned that it is "to share", we all should expect that the average buyer of the King-Size bar will eat it all themself. Hence, calories here X 2 = 300 calories & 24g of Sugar if eaten by one person; "WOW"!! üò©
--------------------
Loved it. So yummy.
--------------------
I didn't like these much as a kid, but as a grownup, I LOVE THEM. I haven't tried them in years, but I'm so glad I did because this candy bar is added to the list of new favorites. If you haven't had it in a while, I strongly suggest you try them again, you won't be disappointed.

I honestly forgot how much I enjoy the taste of this candy bar as I have not eaten it since childhood. I love the salty taste with the hard texture of the peanuts. I would recommend.

Delicious! Perfect amount of peanuts and caramel!

I definitely want to order another Hershey's box 9. My husband snagged all the Pay Day bars after mentioning how much he use to eat them. It's one of the classes that people love but forgot.

Paydays are so good they remind me of my childhood because my grandmother always had them in her candy jar. The peanuts and caramel are my favorite combination so it's definitely my go to when I'm at the grocery store.
--------------------
great taste you'd expect from the Hershey's brand, perfect size for one to enjoy. id definitely buy it again. i was aware of this product before receiving my sample box but i had never tried it. i was pleased with it and would definitely recommend it. it does have a lot of peanuts though so if youre not a big peanut person you probably wont like it.

This was actually my first time trying a payday! I love the caramel!
--------------------
I love pay day candy, the salty sweet combo is my absolute favorite. The snack size is perfect for a sweet snack but not going overboard with a full size. I love that they have peanuts and also hit that sweet tooth craving.
--------------------
This candy bar doesn't have chocolate but it does have salty peanuts with a gooey, delicious filling. Wants sweets but not chocolate? This is a great choice.

Great if you love caramel and nuts
--------------------
Pay Days are delicious and these snack size are just right for a pick me up. They are also good for lower calories while trying to diet.
--------------------
This salty, sweet mix with the salted peanuts and caramel was so good. Salt can easily overpower things but the center being full caramel helped so much. These were in little 2 or 3 bite size bars depending on what you consider a bite size and wrapped individually. So they were perfect to take as a snack on the go, to work or just grab a few and walk around the house while eating.
--------------------
I wasn't that crazy about this but my husband loved it! I found the peanuts to be a bit salty for my taste but again, husband thought the salt was balanced out very well with the caramel.

Nothing better than a PayDay! The caramel nougat covered with peanuts is a family favorite in my household. I know when I buy a bag of them they are quickly gobbled up by my husband and daughter; I usually have to hide one or two if I hope to get any! If you are wanting a snack loaded with crunchy caramel goodness then this is a must have.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite candy bars. It's simply carmel covered in peanuts. The sweet and salty combination is something I. always crave! This is a very satisfying sweet treat.
--------------------
I love PayDay candy bars and these snack-sized payday bars are the perfect size for a small snack for me. There were many pieces in the bag and it was easy to grab and go. These are great tasting and I enjoyed the caramel and peanuts. I would definitely recomend!
--------------------
The paydays were overly salty and way too hard. The flavour tasted good but it was too hard to chew and the salt was really offputting. It didnt taste like past paydays i ate.
--------------------
These are a favorite transportable snack of mine. I always throw a couple in my purse or bookbag so I can have a yummy treat throughout the day. Peanuts are something I snack on regularly but this better because CARAMEL,duhhh. If you like peanuts and caramel you will love the payday, it's the perfect combination of salty and sweet.
--------------------
It was my first time having Payday and I liked it a lot. The peanut caramel bars was delicious. The snack size is a good size for a craving. I thought the saltiness of the peanuts and the sweetness of the caramel complemented each other well. Also, the caramel was not overly sweet or sticky. I would definitely buy Payday again.
--------------------
Really great taste great mix of flavor just wish they had a little bit more caramel
--------------------
sweet, super crunchy and chewy. it's everything i want in a candy bar.

I am a first time Hershey's Sampling Box customer, but not new to the Pay Day Snack Size Peanut Caramel Candy Bar that was part of the sample. I haven't a Pay Day Candy Bar in years and I forgot how good this candy bar is. The salted peanuts and caramel is a great mix. I shared this product with my students, and they loved it as well. Pay Day now has new customers. I highly recommend Pay Day Snack Size to share with peanut lovers or to keep them as a treat for yourself.

Love these -- been a fan for decades. Low in fat and sodium, so win-win! If you're a peanut and caramel fan, you can't go wrong.
--------------------
Great price, perfect size, plenty in the bag, can't go wrong with this buy. Except to purchase two bags and that is exactly what I did!
--------------------
These delicious chocolate treats have a wonderful nougat center. There is the perfect amount of peanuts and nougat to chocolate ratio. The crunch is one that is satisfying and delicious. Perfect size for grab bags or a pick me up chocolate treat mid day. The size is one that is also ideal for a convenient lunch box treat. The package is easy to open for thr individual as well as the bag. There are a decent number of pieces in the bag. I am. Very happy with the product and the quality of the packaging and the flavor itself. I would recommend this product to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Snickers is my favorite candy bar
--------------------
Who doesn‚Äôt like snickers?
--------------------
Always fresh and good to have in my purse when ever I need a snack!
--------------------
It was literally gone in 1 1/2 And I have no regrets! They tasted amazing and now that I know they‚Äôll come through the mail safe, I‚Äôll get them again! And they are super simple to use for handing out candy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
In our house we love Snickers candy bars do they rarely last more than a day. That‚Äôs great if you are in a diet and your family eats them before you can get to them but not great if your are baking a special treat... a Snickers chocolate cake. This package size is perfect to hide away for baking! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Snickers are chewy, nutty, and chocolate, the fun size is great for a quick snack and pick me up and great for travel. Forget giving them on just Halloween, their great anytime. I love them frozen the best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love snickers. It is my favorite candy. Unfortunately, I love these so much I have a hard time stopping at just one or two. The package is a fair size for at home consumption. The bars are individually wrapped and create an image that you are practicing portion control. The candy was fresh and delicious. Size is perfect for one bite, unless you open two or three at a time because you are addicted. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Bought these for Halloween but...they didn't last the week! Once the bag was opened that smell of Milk chocolate, nougat, caramel, peanuts...brb I need another. As I was saying, its a delicious confection. Really prefer these fun sized because they are on my diet.. regular and big bars are not. My only complaint is my own fault..shoulda bought a bigger bag [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love Snickers chocolate candy bars. The fun size are perfect when you need a little something to hold you over or satisfy that craving. We toss them in brownies, cookies, and ice cream. There‚Äôs so many different ways to enjoy a Snickers bar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Snickers are one of my favorite candies. The fun size is a great option for Halloween or if you just want a smaller portion. I keep them in a dish at my house for visitors! I highly recommend Snickers if you love peanuts, chocolate and caramel! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Well my apparently underfed black lab got a hold of this bag and ate the whole thing. Wrappers and all. And she didn‚Äôt even die or get the poops! So I‚Äôd say they were tasty and not deadly. Good job, Snickers!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love snickers alot its my favorite candy, especially for the Halloween I buy it a lot, I always recommend it to my friends and family for all the occasions, even at work, its has the delicious taste of chocolate and peanut together. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I bought this a month ago during my son birthday. Everyone likes it. All my kids friends ate everything. They really enjoyed the party. It‚Äôs really a hit in party. Nice taste, crunchy peanuts, caramel melting in mouth. Worth for the price. Best quality chocolate. Very safe for kids and adults [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
These snack size candy bars are perfect for trick or treat. Everyone loves chocolate, i eat one as a treat before bed with a glass of milk. I am going to put them with some hard candy to pass out on halloween. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
We love snickers candy bars and these smaller fun size bars are perfect when we want something to kick a chocolate craving. Its the perfect combination and its a good size so we can have a few and not feel guilty. My son loves them for a sweet after school snack. They are also great when they are chilled in the fridge or freezer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
These little guys are an awesome snack when you're wanting a little sugar but don't want to indulge in a full size bar. Snickers are always awesome but I can throw one or two of these in a bowl of ice cream without feeling too guilty. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
What can I say about Snickers? They are wonderful! I was so surprised to receive a sample of something that is available widely. Snickers are one of my favorite candies, and we especially like the fun size bars. Although I do tend to eat 2 each time! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I absolutely love snickers they're my favorite candy! the size of these minis are GREAT, just enough to satisfy my craving for something sweet. They're bigger than the normal mini candy with works great for me, I would recommend these to anyone who likes snickers and anyone who loves candy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Snickers chocolate is my all time favorite chocolate. Peanut caramel and milk chocolate combined taste is awesome. Every time in my grocery I must buy snickers . If u don‚Äôt have any nut allergy must try this . Definitely I will recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Snickers fun size chocolate candy bar is just that, it is a Snickers, meaning the always delicious treat! The ‚Äúfun size‚Äù is ideal for that candy bar craving but don‚Äôt want to indulge in a normal sized candy bar. It gives you the choice of as little or as many treats you would like. My recommendation is to freeze them! They are sooooo delicious when frozen! And if you‚Äôre feeling extra ‚Äúfun‚Äù you can break apart the frozen bars and put them on top of your favorite ice cream!!! I would absolutely recommend the fun size Snickers bar to anyone and everyone. They make for the perfect Halloween treat too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
These arrived in a box with cold packs and were wrapped perfectly. What‚Äôs not to love about Snickers bars. Creamy milk chocolate, caramel, nougat and peanuts. This is such a winning combination. The bars were soft and creamy... with a little crunch from the peanuts. Made a great little snack when craving chocolate. I actually put a few in the freezer and ate them frozen...just as delicious. I would definitely recommend these to a friend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Snickers has always been a favorite of mine. I love the fun size convenience for school treats, late night treats, Halloween, etc. You can have a treat in a small portion instead of a large candy bar. The bag has plenty as long as your kids don't find it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Snickers Fun Size Bars are the perfect size for a little treat after lunch or dinner, not too much and the perfect flavors. The chocolate and peanuts with the nougat center is the perfect combination of taste and flavor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Snickers bars have always been one of my favorite kinds of candy since I was a kid. I still buy them frequently to have as a snack. Always pick up a couple bags for Halloween to give out to the kids trick or treating (but they usually don't last that long)!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Nothing bad can come from receiving candy in the mail. This came packed with a cooling pack so it wouldn‚Äôt melt in our 102+ temperatures. It has been quite some time since I have had a Snickers and once having one of these, I don‚Äôt know why I waited so long. They are delicious with the peanuts, nougat, and caramel all wrapped up in milk chocolate. These will be on our grocery list the next time we venture out to the store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The sweet taste of milk chocolate, the crunchiness of peanuts, and the softness of the caramel and nuget blended together in one little bar is like a party in your mouth. All the flavors combined make up such a satisfying and fulfilling snack. These fun size bars are really cute. They are the perfect size for kids lunches or a snack. So don‚Äôt be a Karen get you a snickers bar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Always fantastic. Eat one, you will eat the whole bag. They are always great!
--------------------
Luckily I have been blessed with a lot of will power, and eat very little sweets. However these are my weakness, as they are made with all the things I really love; and these miniature bars are the perfect size for me! Great for stocking stuffers, Halloween, birthday parties.....endless possibilities! They arrived in perfect condition, as well.
--------------------
I like this brand no matter what and I paid very little for it less than 3 bucks but I wasn't expecting the package to be opened..... Makes me re-consider of ordering online from target if that kind of thing happens.
--------------------
These have become so hard to find! I went to a few stores to find them. They had a great taste and texture! Such a delicious candy bar! A little pricey for the amount that you get, wish there were more included in the bag.
--------------------
Candy bars arrived old, melted, smushed shapes.
--------------------
Always wonderful. They are my current favorite.
--------------------
A treat but only for pick up. Delivering candy with target created a melted mess.
--------------------
These are really fresh. The caramel is soft and chewy, not hard or dry. The crispies are nice and fresh, as well.
--------------------
Our fave since childhood!! Love the snack size and sometimes hard to find. Thank you Target for always keeping in stock !!
--------------------
Target candy is always fresh! Love 100 Grands!
--------------------
Great taste and such a yummy caramel
--------------------
Target standard shipping is about the only way to get this candy these days.
--------------------
Best candy I've ever had. Every piece is satisfying in itself. Under rated.
--------------------
Tiny bag. Large price. Would not buy again!
--------------------
Kinda stinks that Nestle changed the bags from 11oz to 10oz and Target/Nestle kept the same price. Now paying more for less.
--------------------
Who doesn‚Äôt love a big mix of chocolate candy?! This bag has it all. For someone who loves chocolate but also loves variety, this was a hit. The snickers was perfect when I needed something a little salty! Twix helped satisfy that crunch craving! Milky Way was perfect for when I needed a little caramel and Three Musketeers is just a good soft chocolate bar! I loved this mixed bag!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Some of them were unwrapped...about 10 pieces.
--------------------
Some of candies were melted in the packet
--------------------
This is a great mix of candy varieties. With that said, some of them are not as well-suited to be this small. When I bought these for Drive Up, I clearly did not pay close enough attention to the size of the bars. The mini size -- a small square -- often has a different texture and chocolate-coating-to-filling ratio.
--------------------
It‚Äôs expensive, and it‚Äôs not well sorted.
--------------------
Good variety and delicious. Hopefully I don't eat it all. :)
--------------------
This was such an AWESOME delivery!! No surprise, my kids loved it - but, so did my hubby and I. We put some of them in the freezer, and used others crumbled up as toppings. You will not regret this buy!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My Grandkids LOVED having this little Bag of snacks around! The bars were just the right size for them to snack on thru out the day! I would recommend this product to anyone with children ages 3 and up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Great variety of candy bars
--------------------
This a good mix of chocolate to give out for Halloween. They are minis so you can confidently give multiples but also a variety so there will be the ones you want to eat and the rest to give away. Great little bite sized pieces when you need just a quick sugar fix. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This size is the perfect size , just enough to fulfill the urge for chocolate. Al the popular varieties , Snickers, Twix, and M & M's. Perfect for the Halloween trick or treaters. This size , the fun size is my favorite, enough to get it the perfect snack size, highly recommend for Halloween. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love SNICKERS, TWIX, MILKY WAY & 3 MUSKETEERS. They come in little packages and you can take a few here and there. My favorite of all time is three musketeers. They taste like the bigger candy bars but yet you don‚Äôt have to have a lot and you can save for later [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
All the classics in one bag! What is better than that? It's awesome to have the variety, and it's also great that they are not so large so you can have one of each if you're not giving them all away :) Individually wrapped, so they're good to go for Halloween! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I recieved this a few weeks ago and I (and my family in the house) DEVOURED this bag of candy. It was a decent sized bag and had a bunch of different chocolate candy bars and brands so it would be great for Halloween to hand out some chocolate candy and some sweet candy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
How could I even review these when they were gone shortly after I opened the bag? I barely got a chance to savor the crunch of a Twix as I licked the flavorful caramel from the top. I slowly bit through the thick mixture of Carmel and nuts as I enjoyed the texture of the Snickers bar. I closed my eyes as I snapped my KitKat in half to experience the layers of goodness as I bit through them. Was I dreaming? Is this real? Have I really eaten the whole bag?

I bought this because it gives me all the different mix of chocolate that I need. My kids love it and the quality is always there. These candy's do hold up to the heat as long as it is only briefly.

What‚Äôs not to love about the Mini Mix of snickers, Twix, Milky Way and 3 musketeers? My husband has an insatiable sweet tooth, so these treats were not safe in our home. I found the package next to his recliner. So much for Halloween. These really are the perfect size for when you just need a little something. Great variety of candy. Will be buying more.

This is my honest review for the Snickers, M&Ms & Twix Minis. First of all I'm a chocolate lover and the minis for just enough to fulfill that love. I like the fact that they come in the smaller sizes so they are sharable. I have a few kid's in my apartment complex, so I shared with them. They enjoyed them as much as I did. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I originally wanted this candy for Halloween, but my children got into it first. They were very pleased with the different candies that were in the bag. And i think it would be perfect for trick or treating children. I'll be purchasing more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

All of the candies that come in this variety are super yummy! That all seemed rationed out evenly. These one bite candies are perfect for small children or to satisfy your sweet tooth without all the calories of a full sized candy bar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I‚Äôm a chocolate lover and this bag is great. It has 3 of my favorite chocolates- M&M‚ÄôS, Twix and Snickers. They‚Äôre bite sized and perfectly sized.

As a picky easter I do not want a random mix of chocolate that I'm going to skip over half of, but this bag is incredible. It's all the good stuff and no junk!

It‚Äôs great to have a bag of all our favorites. The convenient size is perfect for all our grandkids (and the parents). We always have candy out and the large size last long. They tend to eat them all so we know it‚Äôs a hit after a long weekend. I love M&Ms, Twix and Snickers so sometimes I have to hide a few. Mars and Wrigley have been a trusted name throughout our lives. Enjoy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Snickers, Twix, Milky Way & 3 Musketeers, Minis mix was a great selection of different chocolates. I loved the variety so I could enjoy a different taste whenever I wanted a sweet treat. It was great for days when I needed a quick snack for energy or just to reward myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this bag and the assortment is great. I eat almost every type except one. I leave those for my fiancee. Quality chocolate, perfect size piece if you just want a little snack. 3 musketeers just has a bit to much chocolate for me. I love the middle though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Snickers, M&M‚Äôs & Twix pack was fantastic for birthday party gift bags. The bag contains M&M‚Äôs in both peanut and plain. The Snickers are about a two bite size as is the Twix. There were plenty of candid in the bag so I was able to do gift bags for seven kids and still have some left over. It‚Äôs a great way to allow the little ones to have candy without it being too much. Moms are happy because the kids are happy. It‚Äôs a win win! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I got these a few weeks ago and they‚Äôre the best. All our favorites in one bag and the whole family is happy. I just wish they‚Äôd add a lil more Twix. It was nice they were fall themed.

These are just the right size for those times you don't want a whole candy bar. Plus the kids love that they are just one bite. The packaging is very nice and keeps them fresh. Perfect for passing out on Halloween. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love how this bag had 4 of my favorite candy bars in one bag. I love how they are bite size so very convenient when you just want something small to eat. I loved all 4 of the candy bars.

This variety pack of candy is the perfect treat size for kids and for adults. It‚Äôs all our favorites in one bag in small sizes, so you can one of each flavor. I‚Äôve been using them as treat rewards for my kids- it‚Äôs easy and small, so I don‚Äôt worry about them having too much sugar. I would get these again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love these little mini candy bars. They are the perfect size to have a little treat but not go overboard. I love the flavors Twix, Milky Way, Snickers, and Three Musketeers. I am partial to the Milky Way though. I like that I have a choice. I share them with my husband and keep them out for company. They are enjoyed by all. I will continue to buy them in the future.

OMG!! Who doesn't like candy!! I opened the bag right away and my family dug right in. It was fresh and soft and tasted great.

This bag was the perfect mix if variety for our family. Twix fir mom, snickers from dad, and m&ms for the kids. Perfect for a quick little.bite to curb that sweet tooth. But I bet you can have just one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This candy bar assortment was so good! I put them in the freezer because I like cold and hard candy bars. I eat them every night after supper. My favorite is the Twix bars. They are the perfect size for just a quick snack if you are Crabb something sweet. Thanks again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This was a perfect mix of my favorites. Everything was fresh and the right size bag for where I live for Halloween. Unfortunately the bag did not make it for Halloween. This is a smaller size bag so if you tend to not get a ton of trick or treaters this is perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This candy is awesome. The bag is big enough you get a variety of candy so you have enough to last awhile it‚Äôs perfect for snacking, parties or Halloween. The flavors are great they taste good and made well the brand is high quality I would definitely recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this candy to see what kind of candy I wanted to hand out to children this Halloween. This candy is the perfect size for Halloween. This candy is also tasty and filled perfectly, so you can have the perfect bite of candy. I also love that it is bite sized. It is good on a whim went you just want a bite of something sweet. It will also be good for younger children who tend not to eat all of there candy because of the size. It saves on wasted candy. I would recommend that everyone but this for Halloween because it is the perfect candy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Love this variety pack! Has a great mix of all of the classics. M&Ms both peanut and plain, Snicker's and Twix in a great mix of all. Great piece count and love that they are all fun size and not those tiny pieces. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I bought the SNICKERS, TWIX, MILKY WAY & 3 MUSKETEERS, Minis Mix Chocolate Halloween Candy Bag, 9.87 Oz for the family to enjoy. There is nothing better then this Mini Mix, it has everyones favorite chocolate in it and in nice bite size. I recomend this nice treat to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This candy variety bag is awesome. It has all of my favorite chocolate covered treats and all of them taste super good. The bag has twix, m &m's, peanut m&m's and snickers. I especially love that the twix have both RIGHT and LEFT bars. Another cool thing is that my bag had more than 55 pieces. I imagine that is an error, but still super nice. I originally wanted to rate this 3 stars, because the amount of candy of each variety is very inconsistent and no where near even. The bag had 9 packets of peanut m&ms, 22 snickers, 14 regular m&ms, and 11 left twix, and 2 right twix. If you are a snickers lover then this perfect for you! I opted to rate it 4 stars instead of 3 due to the 3 extra candy pieces in my bag. Overall, this is a great mix of candy, especially if you love snickers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Absolutely our Best Buy. This mix is finally the right one for our family. Too many times in the past I‚Äôve bought a snack sized mix bag of candy only to have one or two of the offerings eaten. This mix is great there is something everyone likes in our family and finally none left that no one likes. We will buy this one again and again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This has to be hands down the best mixture of candy chocolate around. The bag lasted me over a month with two of us in the home. It‚Äôs a great price and overall who doesn‚Äôt love chocolate! You can never get tried because there are so many options of candy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
What can I say?! This is just a wonderful mix of candies. Perfect bite sized pieces. I leave a candy bowl on my office desk and I am a hit with my coworkers. Yum yum yum! Everyone loves the classics! 50 pieces last for a while, highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Well the packaging is pretty straightforward - all the candies in this will be some kind of chocolate/caramel mix. I'm a big fan of both chocolate and caramel so the selection here was pretty much spot on for me. Twix and Snickers are pretty well known and most people should know whether or not they like them (I definitely do). The Milky Way Caramel was pretty good as well - it seems to replace the nougat in a normal Milky Way with just more caramel. I wasn't a huge fan of the caramel M&M's. They didn't taste bad but the textures felt a bit off with the thin candy shell outside - slightly firm chocolate shell within that - and then a pretty chewy consistency of caramel. Probably my least favorite of the pack. That all being said I would get this again just for the other 3 candies in the pack. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I esp love Twix and Milky Way. The small sizes are great for portion control. The mix is great-a favorite for everyone! The variety pack was a big hit and I would recommend it greatly! Good value for the bag. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I got this candy about a month ago. My husband and I were like kids at Halloween. Each night we shared candy out of the bag. My favorite was dark chocolate Milky Way. I love Carmel. My husband‚Äôs favorite was the KitKats. The candy was a great treat and we enjoyed it each night. Thanks for the opportunity to share this candy and to try-it.

I'm a caramel fiend! With the recent work from home orders, I bought this variety pack to keep around the house, making up for the snacks I was missing out on at the office. Needless to say, this mixture hit the spot and I may have eaten the whole thing in 2 days. Time to reorder! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
If you love caramel, this is the perfect assortment bag! The bag does seem to contain mostly snickers; I wish there was a way to more appropriately give a more even amount of each candy. Bonus is that everything but the Twix is gluten free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is an absolute hit at my house with my family. The candy is just the ones that we love all in one. I love the portion sizes so that you can reward your children, but they not get a full size amount of chocolate. They also work great for lunch boxes and for when on the go. With the 55 pieces you have enough candy to last a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The bag has a nice mix of chocolate candies Snickers, M&Ms and Twix . All my family members and guests liked these chocolates so much and it ran out in no time.

I am a HUGE chocolate lover I get a sweet tooth for chocolate. This was definitely awesome to have whenever my sweet tooth acted up. I love how there are 5 different choices in the bag. I love to put them in the fridge or freezer to keep them cold and from melting. The small size is perfect for when you just want something small and sweet. So if you have a sweet tooth and love chocolate this is definitely for you!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Loved this mix! A little bit of everything peanut-y. Nice mix of snickers (regular and peaunut butter), and m&m‚Äôs (Peanut and peaunut butter). Loved this combo bag and will definitely be purchasing again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Mixed Mars Minis Size Variety Bag is a great family sized bag for those who eat in moderation or balance and simply want a light indulgent treat. One, here or there, would last a pretty decent span of time. However, if one is a chocolate lover, this bag will NOT be enough: (1) because this bag is a tease (they are minis!) and (2) because fifty pieces of candy can go quickly if one is sharing these things. Overall, I would always recommend Mars chocolate because it's the best, but this variety pack REALLY needs some Peanut M&Ms and may be some fun-sized candy and I'll be sold. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Ummm, yes. Would buy again in a heartbeat. Chocolate and peanut butter are a weakness of mine. LOVE peanut butter M&M's. Wish the peanut butter Snicker's was fun size instead of snack size, but that is the only thing to complain about. I just had to eat more than one to satisfy my craving... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Well first off who doesn't love a good chocolate. I know I do especially when they are from fantastic brands that use only he highest quality ingredients. You can tell the quality of the chocolate by the taste and man these don't disappoint!! I am a sucker for quality chocolate and this variety bag has all my faves. The variety is fantastic with something for everyone to enjoy. The peanuts in the Snicker's are always tasty and crunchy not at all soggy. The Carmel in the twix and Snicker's just is amazing and oh so stringy and yummy. I like that it came with two varieties of m&Ms too as I enjoy switching them up. The size of this bag is even perfect to bring for a get together as it's huge or just to keep at home to nosh on when you feel the craving. Overall fantastic candy brands in this variety bag .

My whole family loved this bag of peanut and peanut butter Mars candies. It contained an assortment of Peanut M&M's, Peanut Butter M&M's, Snickers and Peanut Butter Snickers. I had never tried Peanut Butter M&Ms or Peanut Butter Snickers before. The M&Ms became my favorite. The only thing I didn't like was that the regular Snickers were the "fun size" but the Peanut Butter Snickers were just small squares, smaller than the regular Snickers. I'm not a huge Snickers fan, but thought the Peanut Butter version was good and would have liked them in the same size as the regular Snickers. All in all, a great back of candy if you're a peanut/peanut butter lover like me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love this assortment. Provides the perfect amount of sweet and saltiness. The M&M peanut butter tastes better than the M&M peanuts in my opinion. They remind me of Reese‚Äôs pieces but better since each bite has more peanut filling. Highly recommend peanut butter lovers to try this one out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
First, I want to talk about the shipping. This was shipped with three ice packs in an insulated(?) bag. This survived the Nevada heat without any problems!

My family loved this mix of candy! It has something everyone liked so no one was left out. They are so small and perfect for just a light snack without having to eat a full candy bar.

This mix essentially flies out of the candy bowl. It has all the best candy bars, and they are perfect sized for a quick little sugar boost to improve your day. It's been fun to see which ones are the family favorites. Our faves in order of disappearance: Twix, Midnight Milky Way, Milky Way, 3 Musketeers, Snickers.

How can you really go wrong with a bag of chocolates? The reason I love this bag, is that it is filled with candy that has caramel in it. YUM.

Overall I would absolutely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really enjoyed this bag of. mini chocolate's. It has a great variety of individually packaged candy. This 16 ounce bag comes with Milky Way Dark, Milky Way, 3 Musketeers, Twix and Snickers. I like the small size of the candy because sometimes you just need a smaller piece to satisfy your sweet tooth. I also don't want to over indulge so I choose my favorite and come back for more later. This variety pack is just right and offers a nice selection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

A good value, but there were a lot more Hershey's bars than the picture on the bag lets on. Everyone in my office goes for the Reese's and KitKat's, then the Hersey's sit for weeks untouched.
--------------------
I love the variety in this bag. My favorite are the Mr. Goodbar. I always buy this assortment and will be doing so soon when I get a sweet tooth.
--------------------
This is an awesome assortment of chocolates, you get Reese's mini cups (my favorite), Hershey's dark chocolates, Rolos, and Kit-Kats. There was something for each of us that we love. I like the mini size because it's perfect for when you want just a little bite of sweet and not a whole candy bar. This bag would also be great for handing out at halloween or having in a candy dish around the office or home. You get quite a bit of each type and I don't feel like it was an uneven amount of each type, where as in some assorted bags you get a bunch of one kind and barely anything of the others. A resealable bag would be great for storing them away but it's really nothing a ziploc bag can't fix. love having so many options for our candy stash.
--------------------
These are smaller than Fun Size, which is great for those watching calories. You can have a nibble and your sweet tooth will be satisfied without too many calories. I prefer this size so I can limit my sugar intake. I don't think they are too small for Halloween. I give the kids 3 or 4 pieces instead of one or I let them grab a handful themselves. Even though they can only fit about 3 pieces in their hands, they LOVE being able to grab a bunch at once. My candy arrived in a box in fine shape. I've already bought about 4lbs of candy so kids will be getting more of the bag this year.
--------------------
This assortment is the BEST! The rolo's went first. All the chocolate was very fresh and delicious. This package is really big. There is plenty to share! This was great to put out in a candy bowl at a party we had. Everyone really enjoyed all the variety! It was nice to have such a large selection in 1 bag, that I didn't have to get multiple bags to get this mixture.
--------------------
One word: rolos! I was thrilled to find rolos included in this mix!!! Fantastic mix of chocolates. Plenty to go around our party with some even left over to go home with everyone
--------------------
I love this assortment. The mix is all my favorites. It's great for a candy bowl. Whether I'm in the mood for a Reese's or kit kat, it's only a short reach away. And with the small size, I can easily have one of each guilt free.

Welp, if you don't LOVE Hershey chocolates, I feel bad for you! Hershey dark chocolate is just the right amount of sweetness and tartness. I love these miniatures because they're the perfect size for something small and sweet, especially if you're trying to cut back. I will continue to purchase Hershey products because they are so yummy, the smaller sizes are convenient, and I love to share with friends and family. They have a long history of quality chocolate products and it's easy to see why.

I love chocolate, but not a fan of the dark chocolate. This mixture of sweet and crunchy was perfect and they were the perfect sizes to satisfy that sweet tooth!
--------------------
Loooove this assortment. Lots of chocolatey goodness all in one bag. I feel like it's almost critical to buy the family size bag because it goes so quickly. I do wish there were Krackles in the bag...and if the Kit Kats and Reese's peanut butter cups outnumbered the plain Hershey chocolates. Still amazing though and fantastic to have on hand. Another great item for the candy jar...if it doesn't all get eaten before it gets to the jar.
--------------------
This was the perfect mix of chocolates. They had so many good chocolates mixed in making it perfect. The bag didn't last very long with me

I love all of the chocolate choices in the bag. They are all classic flavors and deliver the flavors exactly how I remember them as a kid. It is a good mix of candy and a little goes a long way.

I am the biggest fan of reese's peanut butter cups and Hershey milk chocolate bars so was super excited to get this bag. My husband and kids enjoyed the kit-kats and rolos.

Even though they are miniature they still have that chocolate goodness big taste.

I love when I can find this bag of Hershey's Assortment Chocolates they are so good because you get different choices of sweets that you may want. I always have them on hand for when guests stop by. Unless the family has devoured them. That does happen because they are so good and addictive. Hersheys is a brand I trust and will continue to buy!

--------------------
I love Hershey bars and Kisses. They always make me happy.
--------------------
I love Hershey's chocolate with almonds. It's the perfect combination of chocolate and nuts and my family's favorite chocolate bar. The chocolate is smooth and creamy and the nuts are the perfect amount of crunch. I would definitely buy and recommend.
--------------------
Yum! I love the fun size because you get a little bit of chocolate when you just want something sweet.
--------------------
I like these M&M because they are very small and they have different colors and they are just so good.
--------------------
One of my favorite snacks, would recommend this on a movie night specially the peanuts one.
--------------------
I love mini M&Ms! I love putting them in brownie mix and adding them on top of cupcakes.
--------------------
M&M'S are one of my favorite candies and had been ever since I was a little girl & would always seperate them by their colors before I would eat them! Well I I grew out of always seperating them 1st but I haven't out grown eating them! They taste so good and I love the peanut M&M'S too but the regular ones are my favorite.
--------------------
I love chocolate so this is awesome. These small bags are easy to keep in your car or purse for a ready to eat snack.
--------------------
Love this product! M&Ms have always been my favorite! I purchase these regularly, and have been doing so for quite some time! The fun size is perfect for an individual and I would 100% recommend!
--------------------
You cant go wrong with M&Ms whether in a bag or in a small container, they are the best. Milk chocolate , add the to your popcorn box and get a fun treat every time. The bes thingshare with Freds and fairly members, we did this when we watched Star Wars and many other movies, we enjoy sharing and having fun. I Recommend you doing the same.
--------------------
I love these!!! My favorite thing to do is buy the bulk pack and put them in my popcorn at night
--------------------
I am a huge m&m fan I love the sweet chocolate taste and the crunchy outer shell, but the m&m minis are wonderful for baking. My teenage son love when I put these in their pancakes and cookies, protien balls you name it and they are the perfect size to do just that. You can put as much or as little as you want and then close up for later or put in a ziploc bag. Definitely affordable and worth the happiness.
--------------------
I like these a lot because I can just pop a handful in my mouth. I can only have the plain ones so Im not sure how the other ones taste. I try not to buy them a lot because I can literally eat the whole thing in one sitting.
--------------------
Never had them in a bag the tube is the only way I get them. My store has them in the bag but its a lot more fun to pop the top and pour in your mouth! They are mini and so good. To me a lot more fun then regular size.
--------------------
Love the M&Ms fun size candy bags. Their just the right size for a little candy snack.
--------------------
I am not much of a candy person but I find when I am craving some sweetness this is my go to! I pick out all the red ones first because I like them best! My husband says they all taste the same.. WRONG
--------------------
M&M fun size bags are a perfect on the go treat for my family. It can be used in many ways and is a great price. I would recommend this to anyone this to anyone who is one the go alot or to anyone who is a chocoholic. Even with toddler that need a treat on a road trip. Works good for my daughter that's a diabetic that need to treat a low blood sugar. M$M's and they have so many flavors. Who couldn't like them.
--------------------
The M&Ms are really good they are good little snacks for kids to have .they have good flavors. I would improve them by putting a little more in the packs. They are a good price. If you have little kids this is good snack for them
--------------------
What can I say. @m&ms are the best snack chocolate candy. When I was younger back in the 1960s and 1970s two types were available, plain and peanut and to this day both are favorites
--------------------
I loveee this treat for myself you should definitely try without being scared of gaining weight its soo good
--------------------
Love m&ms!!! They are easy to eat, I love to give them to my kids as a sweet treat occasionally because what kid doesnt love little bits of sweet!
--------------------
It's just as you remember from your childhood. This product is great for trick or treaters because it's very basic. I do think that the amount of m&ms has gone down in the bag (kind of like chips in a Lay bag). I prefer the mini M&Ms for the candy-chocolate ratio, but these are good.
--------------------
Satisfises the craving for chocolate, but not quite the best option. Would only choose if I had no other choice. The outer shell has a strange taste to it and the chocolate has a weird flavoring. The brown color of the bag makes the product less appealing to the public.
--------------------
Super yummy. They are perfect for a little snack or a little treat if you are trying to be good. We always keep them in our office to hand out to kiddos. They love when they see the fun size bags. Will buy again.
--------------------
I like m&m's. It's chocolate and affordable. Everyone i know eats this chocolate. I like the flavor and the way you leave it in your mouth and the chocolate just melt in your mouth lol. I buy a bag all the time in the weekends and the children love the chocolate.
--------------------
Cant go wrong with the classic M&M. I enjoy the hard outer body and the creamy chocolate in the middle. This chocolate is perfect for a party snack. I dont M&Ms that pfennig, but Im always happy when I get a pouch.
--------------------
This product is an absolute classic! Its so delicious and packed full of flavor! I love how it can even be customized for special occasions. There is honestly nothing like it, because it is such a unique candy. It has been around for such a long time, and theres a good reason why.
--------------------
I love chocolates, and a bag is never enough, although I could not eat it every day, if I taste them, I eat them, I savor them
--------------------
I‚Äôve had these several times. They are wonderful. I do have one negative comment and that is this bag is horrible to open. Have a inflammatory joint disorder, these bags are nearly impossible to open. Too much pain in my hands. Maybe it would be better to have a zipper opening.
--------------------
This is the original type and they don't disappoint . The are afford and taste like good chocolate .I like these alot but the peanut m&ms are better . I would 100% recommend these to anyone who likes chocolate candy . I will continue to repurchase these for a long time . :)
--------------------
Who doesnt like m&ms they are so good.. and I love the fun size easy to carry on the go and just the right amount to eat.
--------------------
I buy these every year for the holidays. My guests love them and they are so festive and delicious. I also bake them in cookies. Red and green M&Ms say, Merry Christmas in our house.
--------------------
We always have these little red and green candies in a dish at Christmas. Melt in your mouth, not in your hand is true even for the littlest snackers in my house over the holidays.
--------------------
It's npt the holidays without some red and green M&Ms!! Most everyone knows how delicious these are so there's not much to say besides the fact that they're delicious! M&Ms will be around for decades to come Im sure
--------------------
My family always buys this large a bag when Christmas rolls around since it's usually offered at a great value and will last the whole season. It's really hard to stop yourself from grabbing a whole handful when you walk by a dish with these in it. Would always reccomend them!
--------------------
WHO DOESNT LOVE M&MS? I dont like any other flavor except the milk chocolate one and I think its HIGHLY addictive because its JUST SO GOOD!
--------------------
This product is really great. They are so many flavors to choose from but my favorite is the chocolate one. The texture is really amazing.
--------------------
Love putting these in homemade cookies for my kids. Theyre easier for them to chew in the cookies and fun colors for them. They request them now
--------------------
My favorite M&Ms!!!! Theyre so soft and easy to eat. These are good for ice cream toppings!!!
--------------------
i like these a lot, the chocolate is sweet and delicious and the outer shell is really good as well. i recommend this candy to anyone who likes chocolate.
--------------------
I love the taste of the chocolate its soooo good ....
--------------------
Love original M&Ms. Taste is perfectly sweet, and not overwhelming. Perfect to eat alone or to throw on cakes or other snacks.
--------------------
This is the perfect size when you just want a little something sweet! You cant go wrong with this! The classic M&M is delicious!
--------------------
Tasty and sweet they are perfect by the handful. I eat these once a month usually and usually have to eat the whole bag. I would improve packaging, brown just doesnt work for me.
--------------------
How can you not give this chocolate 5 stars. It is so delicious I always carry a bag in my purse you can not walk past by them and not buy a bag their delicious
--------------------
I love love M&M milk chocolate but there is mostly sugar in chocolate and it could damage ur dental health.
--------------------
The perfect size if you have a sweet tooth. Not a huge fan of chocolate but a small bag is ok once in a while. Usually have to buy several pack to get the fun size so thats the main downside.
--------------------
Love the is chocolate M&M I've been eating them since I was a kid and now my kid eat them too they don't melt as fast as other chocolate
--------------------
You cant go wrong with the original milk chocolate M&M. I actually think the fun size has just the perfect amount of pieces in it. Again, going to have around for a good afternoon snack
--------------------
I love M&Ms they are a classic must have candy. Love that it comes in different sizes and flavors, but these specifically are my top favorite. They are tasty, crunchy and definately fill my cravings. Perfect for a snack or just to gift or eat every now and then.
--------------------
I mean you really cant go wrong with fun size M&Ms my kids have always been huge M&Ms eaters so the little bags are perfect on the go! Everyone knows M&Ms! Highly recommend!
--------------------
I love M&Ms. You cant eat just one at a time, you have to finish the whole pack. In the summer, they melt in you hands. Yumm
--------------------
I love this product they are so good! The fun size is perfect for sharing with a friend! The only thing is I wished they filled the whole package. These are affordable! I definitely recommend!! Go buy some for a sweet snack!
--------------------
Mmmm this is an all time favorite snack, there is never a wrong time for m&ms! I love chocolate
--------------------
Something about mini size m&ms that hit different. I love these as a kid and I still love them to this day
--------------------
Like i es said a million times before I loveeeee the m&ms mini !!!! They are my favorite chocolate ever!! The ones in the little tube. Awesome. Will forever live them. Thank you! Lol
--------------------
These candies bring me back to my childhood and Im here for it. Definitely recommend!
--------------------
I personally like anything mini. I also am not the biggest fan of the larger M&m's, I rather have the small ones. These are good on top of ice cream!
--------------------
I love these minis! They make me think Im eating less candy when I am actually eating more! I think that these shouldnt be sharing size because I can eat a whole bag myself I love grabbing these and eating them over a few sittings.
--------------------
I dont particularly crave regular m&Ms but something about these minis is addictive. Love to eat them by the handful or put them in baked goods. They do melt in my hand though. Ha.
--------------------
I like the minis. The are great for baking in cookies or brownies. Not my favorite to just eat. But I bake with them a lot.
--------------------
The minis are the best plain m&ms. You can also use them in pancakes, cookies and muffins!
--------------------
Favorite little chocolate fix! Love eating m&ms and blue is the best color!! It tastes better
--------------------
This things a million times better than regular m&ms. I keep them on hand for my sons too. These mixed with some peanuts make a perfect snack for them or mixed with some popcorn. Dont ask me why...but these are so tasty and I hate regular m&ms.
--------------------
These are so good. The only problem is I fit the whole bag in my mouth at once because they are tiny. These are such a fun size. I dont eat them very often but if they are around I will grab them.
--------------------
Who doesnt like a handful of m&ms??? They are delicious.. they are perfect alone, on ice cream, in pancakes, cookies.. the possibilities are endless.. nothing compares!! It brings you back to when you were a child!!
--------------------
The m&m's mini's are stellar. Somehow they are better than the normal size and really hit the pot when you're craving a few m&m's.
--------------------
I know theyre the classic but Im not a fan of plain M&Ms. I dont like the texture or the taste but I know Im the minority.
--------------------
Any Regular M&M's are Amazing! I have enjoyed these since I was very little and they still magnificent at my age, late 40's. This product is perfect just the way it is. It is a great valve and im sure many more kids will continue to enjoy just as I did and will for many more years.
--------------------
My husband loves these he eats these candies with vanilla yogurt. I make a trait mix myself with this candy.
--------------------
These m&ms are really good but I like the peanut ones better.
--------------------
I love these little boxes cause you can fit them in your purse. I get these about once a week and eat them through out the week. Make smaller boxes to carry in lunch boxes. very affordable and I love to recommend this to my family a lot and i also buy them these.
--------------------
Favorite candy all my life. Super quick and easy to Eat while driving, shopping, walking, share with the kids etc,
--------------------
My favorite m&ms! Theyre so cute and for some reason taste so much better to me than the big ones M&M's Milk Chocolate Minis - 10.1 - Sharing Size
--------------------
I get a pack of these with nuts Carmel mix popcorn the best enough for more than 3 people the shell easy to break through chocolate smooth melts right away the cost is cheap will buy again so delicious not to
--------------------
The M&M milk chocolate Minis are the best. I love these. They have always been super fresh when I buy them. These make a great snack. I have bought this product before and will buy again in the future. These are also very affordable.
--------------------
M&M minis served as the perfect potty training currency in our house. Couldnt have gotten the job done without them!
--------------------
I keep a jar of these handy. Great snack to grab a handful of or to add in cookies or candy.
--------------------
I love these little chacolate candys! They do for the most part melt in your mouth not in your hand. LOL They are just the right size and I love how when you bite down its not like a hard crunch. I love the milky chocolate taste. I would surely recommend!
--------------------
I love u , marry me chocolate I love chocolate , m&ms is this is my life saver in class when I am working cause chocolate helps while ur doing work and good for quizzes, this is the best ever , please buy it !M&M'S Milk Chocolate Candy, 1.69-Ounce 48 Count Box
--------------------
I think that M&M's are delicious. If you like chocolate you are going to love these little morsels of goodness. You will want to finish the whole pack by yourself and not share with anybody else. They are perfect for a dessert or if you just want something sweet.
--------------------
These are the perfect size for kids and not too much chocolate. Soft with a light crunchy. Perfect for topping ice cream.
--------------------
What I think about this product is I love it! These are so good! I eat them all the time. I treat myself to these. I wouldn't improve this product at all. Compared to others I trust this brand for this candy. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone.
--------------------
Ummm. Hello. The best snacking candy in the world. Not too much chocolate in a couple of M's and just enough umph to bring joy to whatever you are doing.
--------------------
I think this product is perfect because these are small and easy to eat. they have a good flavor but i wouldnt change anything about them. it is affordable to the normal person. it is repurchase worthy for sure.
--------------------
All M&Ms taste the same but somehow they are still so good. Im not a crazy chocolate person but can always go for these.
--------------------
I love these!!! I always buy them to eat them with my greek yogurt so that it can add flavor to it. Totally recommend them to milk chocolate lovers like me.
--------------------
I like that they tiny and they arent hard candy. Compared to the other M&Ms these are my favorite.
--------------------
Not too crazy about the mint flavor on these buy absolutely love and adore the green diva!
--------------------
M&Ms are on my top 3 lost for favorite candy. They are so good. They will melt in your mouth and have the perfect balance of sweetness to them. The shell adds a nice little crunch! Definitely recommend
--------------------
M&Ms Peanut Chocolate Candy Pouch is sooo good I love chocolate anytime and this is one of my favorite chocolate I ever had.
--------------------
These ones as well are good too taste just about the same as regular m&ms just a little more Christmasy lol
--------------------
Love M&Ms would recommend to anyone! You cant go wrong with Chocolate. Great flavor!
--------------------
My favorite chocolate candy. Not a huge chocolate lover but this is the perfect snack. Just the right amount of chocolate for a quick snack, and the price is right also. Would definitely purchase again!
--------------------
M&ms are so fun to eat and so easy to share! The peanut butter flavor is definitely a must try!
--------------------
The crunch of the outer covering makes the chocolate taste even better. When refrigerated, not only will that prevent your hands from getting the candy melted, but the candy will also taste better when cold.
--------------------
I liked them but not one of my favorite , but I am not big on mint but when I do have a craving for mint this is what I buy .I would not change a thing I think it is fine just how they are the are my grandchild favorites and are priced just right I would recommend them to others.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite and go to candy I love that they offer them in different flavors now, I don't know about the chili flavor but all the rest are great and they are priced at a price anyone can afford and can buy often I will continue to purchase them.
--------------------
Tried and true when you need a good chocolate snack!! I have eaten these since I was a kid
--------------------
Delightful candy treat that are very easy to overeat. Its one of my go to snacks when I need an afternoon pick me up. I love that they have holiday appropriate colors which makes them great to add to desserts for a festive touch.
--------------------
This candy The original is my favorite as well as my sons favorite At Christmas this is on every table in every candy bowl
--------------------
More M&Ms then I could ever dream of eating! These were a hit at my wedding for the candy bar. We filled up mason cars full of many different candies and of course had to have the good old classic M&Ms. The bag was also resalable which was very handy. I will buy this again for sure since the bulk prices are substantially cheaper than boutique or supermarket prices.
--------------------
Yum! I love fun sized M&Ms because they a perfect when you just want a small sweet treat.
--------------------
The combination of peanuts and chocolate really goes good together. Theyre crunchy and chocolaty and makes you want more and more of these candies. This snack is one of my go to for a movie night.
--------------------
This is so good!! I love M&Ns!! Its a classic treat! Amazing favor! Im a fan of this and would buy again.

From a small child I have loved m&ms nothing to change the price is good for me. I will all ways buy them. And everyone should.
--------------------
I love Peanut M&M's. They are definitely my favorite type. Perfect ratio of sweet and salty. It feel it's just simple and perfect.
--------------------
Favorite childhood candy and still is! peanut butter m&ms are the only candy I like that contain peanuts
--------------------
M&M's are one of my favorite candy in the world. If you're looking for a chocolate fix then look no more. This is the one and only.
--------------------
I love these the right bout of chocolate and peanut these are just my favorite bc its not to much of both and I wouldnt change anything
--------------------
I just like eating like 4 pieces. I love to bite on them and find the nut in the choclate and i xan taste the chocolate and nut mix together. You should try it out and find out if you like the testure of it
--------------------
I love peanut M & Ms! They are great to just grab and handful and eat on the go! The peanut inside makes the flavor so great!
--------------------
M&Ms ARE MY FAVORITE SOOO GOOD!! GOO BUY THEMM SUPER CHEAP AND AFFORDABLE U CAN TAKE THESE ANYWHERE WITH YOU!

--------------------
I love M&Ms! And this bag is the perfect size to have on hand when craving something sweet and chocolatey. Its resealable so it keeps the M&Ms fresh and I dont feel like I have to eat the whole bag.
--------------------
The ultimate grab and go treat! I will always love peanut M&Ms. Theyre deliciously satisfying every time and the perfect sweet compliment to popcorn during a move night. I will be a life-long purchaser!
--------------------
I love peanut M&Ms . they are my favorite. I eat them like once every four months something like that. Theres nothing that needs to be improved. And they are affordable.

My mother is obsessed with peanut M and Ms. I always buy her this pack for any holiday.

--------------------
Favorite gas station quick sweet tooth picks. Always fresh and the peanut to chocolate ratio is perfect. If you want a extra treat. Put them in the freezer!!! Yummy! Must try them!
--------------------
I love M&M's. They are my favorite candy. I also like the plain ones also. Makes a great afterschool snack
--------------------
Im not a huge chocolate fan but I do love m&m peanut chocolate. I think the nuts just enhances the milk chocolate. Gives two different textures. I like the small size of the bag because I would not be able to finish a bigger bag.
--------------------
Fresh chocolate with a crunchy peanut. You want to eat more and more has nothing to envy. Excellent product recommended to the consumer. A product that you can find in any establishment. its very economical price.
--------------------
This is my 2nd favorite candy. I love the crunchy candy shell on the outside, the creamy chocolate on the inside and the taste of the peanut ties it all together. Its a classic candy and so delicious.
--------------------
What is better than chocolate and peanuts? You guessed it, nothing! This combo is my all time favorite Please try a bag you will nit regret it! I recommend these!! Definitely worth it
--------------------
I love these use to be a favorite of mine but as I get older there to hard on my teeth unfortunately but they will remain a favorite even if I can't eat them lol
--------------------
Really good! One of my favorite M&Ms and nothing can compare. Its literally candy on the outside and chocolate/peanut on the inside.
--------------------
The best m&m flavor! The nut adds the perfect crunch to the candy. Plain m&ms can be a bit boring so it is the perfect match. The price point is fine for the size. Repurchase all the time, my go to candy!
--------------------
One of my favorite childhood memories was my mom buying peanut M&Ms and putting them in my Easter basket or Halloween bag.
--------------------
This is probably my favorite m&m chocolate thats ever been made because I love how the peanuts taste.
--------------------
So so yummy! I love the crunchy peanuts inside every candy coated chocolate shell! So delicious and can eat a whole bag of these myself! Great value! Super affordable and I really recommend this to others
--------------------
M&Ms peanut are my favorite! They taste yummy, they're crunchy and they really hit the spot. It's the kind of candy where I want to eat the whole bag in one sitting and have to hold myself back. Definitely the standout of the M&Ms varieties. -- [product:m&ms-peanut-candy-fun-size-candy-bag-1057-oz]
--------------------
They are good Not much to say here. You either love mnms or you dont. I happen to love them so I give these 5 stars.
--------------------
Who doesn't love some good old M &M's favorite as a kid same as an adult love this grab and go bag still the same price taste is amazing great for stocking stuffers and wow the flavor is mouth watering. Go grab yours for any reason , you won't regret it
--------------------
The combination of peanut and chocolate its very good. I dont know if there is another one to compare it to. Its a perfect snack/sweet treat. Recommended
--------------------
M&m is so good and really good I love them I have some In my room I going to eat it tomorrow I like it with my popcorn its taste good with popcorn really good yammy
--------------------
Love these m&ms I always keep some at home, I put them in a big jar. One of my favorites with the peanuts they are just sooooo gooood.
--------------------
I love the m&ms with nuts. They are the best m&ms. I absolutely love nuts and chocolate mix so the fact they put them together makes me so happy. I highly recommend this product
--------------------
These products are the same ones I remembered from my childhood. They came in a white wrapper from 8th mile in the Motor City. The wrapper had a tough upbringing, but it was clear that it could make its way to sunny southern California, where I reside. The product itself also had much flavor.My palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavyit don't matter though, this candy's al-ways on the readyMelts in your mouth only, not in yo moms spaghetti
--------------------
Im a chocolate junky I love M&Ms and always have a taste I guess you can say Im addicted
--------------------
In my opinion nuts and chocolate are the best combination. Who doesn't love these?? I highly recommend peanut m&ms.
--------------------
Super yummy. My favorite part is how you can reseal the bag that way they arent wasted. I like these also that way dont have to keep buying more bags and these seem to last longer at least in my household lol.
--------------------
Love the grab and gos even though I cant stop eating them lol. M&ms are one of my favorite chocolates
--------------------
This bag is PERFECT for taking to the movies. It has enough to share with a friend and a cool zip lock top so they dont spill everywhere.
--------------------
These very easy to snack on. My children love the regular M&Ms the best out of all the flavors.
--------------------
SECOND FAVORITE M&M EVER ...WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ANYBODY WHO HASNT ENJOYED THESE GREAT CANDIES
--------------------
My favorite chocolate. Very creamy on the inside and it is very affordable. I buy it every time I go to the grocery store.
--------------------
There are so many M&M flavors now but I think peanuts is the best one. They are great for movie nights or if youre on the go!
--------------------
I love M&Ms with the actual nuts inside. Its the best gives it more flavor so you're not just tasting chocolate. Nothing to improve if you are an M&M lover then you would love them and if you never had them before you should try. Very good!!
--------------------
Best item to get at Halloween! Love it for a quick snack and easy on the go. Id eat M&M all the time
--------------------
These are my sons favorite snack candy. We typically buy at least a couple bags a month.
--------------------
Absolutely love peanut m&ms theyre probably my favorite besides the minis. They are crunchy and chocolatey. I always grab these rather than the original!
--------------------
These chocolates are a must have for any sweet tooth. The flavor is always on point and just like you remember as a kid. I love how the makers have kept the flavor as original as possible over the years. We always buy these when we're picking out goodies for the house.
--------------------
I love chocolate but m&ms just taste weird to me. I still like them but all the times i est them is because someone gave me some. Theyre good but i much prefer ferrero or kisses. Good price and i do recommend if you want to have a snack not only for one day
--------------------
I like mixing the M&Ms into vanilla ice cream. They harden and give you a ice crunch. Chocolate is good quality
--------------------
They are a delight, I really like chocolate, you should be able to eat it every day, sometimes the body asks for something sweet and what better than with these chocolates
--------------------
Perfect chocolate treat. A little expensive. Wish the cost was a little lower, but very good. Purchase regularly
--------------------
The peanut m&ms are my favorite . I've been eating them since I was a kid and they are the best !there is just the right amount of chocolate to peanut ratio. The flavor is great . I wouldn't change them at all and they are affordable . I would absolutely recommend to others.
--------------------
I love these M & M s ! Their the perfect combination of sweet and salty! If you like sweet and salty snacks than I would definitely recommend trying theses.
--------------------
I used to get these all the time after school its way better than rolos. I kept these in my locker. I wouldnt change anything about them. They are so cheap and so affordable. I would definitely recommend to everyone!!!!
--------------------
These are the only m&ms I like. There are so darn good. Been eating them for over 10 years and never get tired of them. The peanut/chocolate combo is wonderful. Love all these different size variations they have.
--------------------
Delicious! Only negative is the temptation to eat so many M&M! Did you know to burn off one M&M you have to walk a whole football field? Crazy! Super yummy and great for traveling.
--------------------
I love purchasing this product because of the chocolate and peanut combination. Its a great snack for me at work and I love it.
--------------------
THESE ARE MY FAVORITE OMG! I always get these and eat the whole bag! If you love peanuts and m&ms these are for you! If you are allergic to peanuts thought please do not eat them! But if you are not allergic, i recommend eating them!
--------------------
I love these especially the big bag never can go wrong they'll amazing The combo of chocolate and peanut is awesome no need for improvement this is at it's Best it's really cheap still I think around five bucks for a big bag of m&m's
--------------------
Fun to eat. Fun to share. Great go to candy for just about anything. Easy to put in your purse, backpack or even your pocket. Full of chocolate and peanuts in every bite.
--------------------
I absolutely love M&M's. They are one of my all time favorite candies with plenty of variety. From cookies to just a snack they're practically a staple in my kitchen.
--------------------
There's nothing better than peanuts and chocolate! A long time candy staple in my childhood and I bet yours too. Always updated for each holiday or just everyday snacking. There's nothing better than the original never melts in your hands just in your mouth! Yum
--------------------
The king size M &M arethe best for size! Plus the chocolate shell is amazing and colorful the peanuts completely top it off. And it make a great snack it the best deal for candy out there.
--------------------
Who doesnt love peanut M&Ms? When I was growing up my grandmother was addicted to peanut M&Ms. She always had a big ball full of M&Ms. At night when all the kids went to sleep I would sneak in there and eat M&Ms with her. I will definitely buy these again and I bet a lot of you guys do also.
--------------------
These are addicting. Its like the perfect mix of salty and sweet. I actually do not like regular m&ms but would eat these every day of the week! The price is the same as other m&ms so I think its worth it.
--------------------
This is the classic! Everyone likes peanut m&MS. Peanuts and chocolate are my favorite sweets flavor combo. I prefer peanut butter, but there's something satisfying with the crunch of a peanut m&m.
--------------------
I usually have these in candy dishes for when my grandkids visit me. They love them and so does everyone else who comes by. I grew up eating them. I think everyone grew up eating them. I've have never met a person who didn't enjoy a bag of m&ms.
--------------------
A perfect blend of crunch outer shell, chocolate and a peanut. It's got the sweet&salty, it's got the crunch and it's got my heart! I could munch on these all day long! They are an elevated version of the M&M which needs something more than just chocolate. Genius creation.
--------------------
I love M&M's . I buy the theater box with peanuts . I highly recommended purchasing a box everyday the price is cheap
--------------------
Peanut M&Ms are the ONLY M&Ms I like! They are just so dang good!! Such a good flavor to them with the peanut added. Not too much chocolate, not too much peanut. Just the perfect amount of both, and so yummy! Always affordable!
--------------------
Who doesnt like m&ms???? One of my favorite chocolate snacks.. very addicting but delicious just cant have one!!!! Brings you back to your childhood!!! There is no other brand that even comes close to this brand!!
--------------------
These are my hidden treat! I dont share with anyone and I keep them in a special place to eat when I have alone time from the hubby and kids. They are the best combo and so yummy!!
--------------------
M&ms are always great. Kids love em. I love em. What could go wrong. Everyone loves chocolate, well at least most people do. The best choice when eating little chocolate spheres
--------------------
I love having a bag of m&ms in the house. A great little treat or we love adding it to our popcorn when we watch movies!
--------------------
I Love M&Ms!! The grab and go bags are a great, good value!! No improvements needed, always perfect!!
--------------------
M&Ms Peanut Candy is my favorite flavor of m&ms. They are very affordable and taste great. I buy these once a month as my treat to myself. I do this to keep from gaining M&M weight
--------------------
Good amount in the bag to share or to take on trips or movies. Its resealable which is great to save for later if you dont finish it all.
--------------------
How can you go wrong with M&Ms?! They are nostalgic and tastes great. My husband goes insane for this candy and can eat a big bag in one setting!
--------------------
I love this size bag for refilling candy jars and just grabbing a handful as a snack. They are always fresh and tasty, as the bag is resealable. The m&ms are delicious and a favorite go to candy in my household.
--------------------
This is one of my son's favorite candies. I love the resealable bag. They melt in your mouth, not in your hand.
--------------------
M&Ms have always been a favorite candy of mine. The chocolate tasted great and the variety of colors they come in make it fun! Affordable!
--------------------
When I was younger it seemed like M&Ms tasted different but now they taste pretty okay. Nothing that sticks out to me. I like the fun sized candies because they are great to hand out at Halloween but overall this candy doesn't really stick out to me.
--------------------
This candy is a great one for so many things cookies, brownies, ice cream and on there own.
--------------------
Love m&ms. I love that they just sort of melt in your mouth. Perfect amount of chocolate.
--------------------
I love all types of M&Ms but these and the caramel ones are the absolute best!! Will buy again.
--------------------
I love this product! They are delicious and the grab and go make it so easy to reseal and take them with you. It can fit right in your bag! I eat these quite often and I recommend everyone to try these! The value is great!! The price is affordable also.
--------------------
Love love love M&Ms soo yummy! I very much like this bag & the bag is so big great size great value for the price. These have a lock seal so thats cool you can snack on them and keep them closed still have that fresh chocolate taste
--------------------
These are my favorite kind of m&ms. Pre covid times my coworkers and I would ALWAYS get these and take our break together and eat these.
--------------------
Whats better than a regular m & m? Peanut m & ms! Its truly the best combo around. These are my go to car or movie theater snack
--------------------
I grew up eating M&Ms but peanut is definitely my favorite flavor. Its classic and my go to at the movie theater.
--------------------
Love my peanut M and Ms! Normally we always have these in out house. Just picked up a huge Bach the other day!
--------------------
This candy was not good. They did not taste like the Crunch bar crunchies at all.
--------------------
Got this for Sunday school kids at church for treat bags. My son loves crunch. Free delivery got it within expected delivery (around 4-5 days) each box is wrapped with plastic, great condition.
--------------------
Bought for stocking stuffer. My daughter loves these.
--------------------
So yummies that we buy, also!
--------------------
I like the idea of a theater box for these, sometimes you just dont need a huge bag
--------------------
Airheads are my favorite! Blue raspberry is my favorite!
--------------------
this is yummy that i buy.
--------------------
These taste great. Brings back childhood memories. Everyone at work loves them as gifts too!
--------------------
Dangerously good. Perfect to eat while watching E. T. (Supposedly, M&Ms were the producer‚Äôs first choice, but the company wasn‚Äôt interested! So Reese‚Äôs it was!
--------------------
I can't get enough of these fatty treats. Hope to steal from my daughters Halloween bag. Super size please
--------------------
What happened?! The cups I used to live taste awful. They almost have a gross honey taste to the chocolate. Our son gagged on one and we didn't know why (its his favourite), so we tasted one and we're shocked at how bad they were!! We had to spit it out! Please check your quality control!! A month prior we bought a package of minis and they tasted bad too - like cheap Easter chocolate (or worse). What happened?!? You need to start reading your 1-star reviews, there is a clear common theme here. Recall your affected products!!!!
--------------------
I have opened two bags of family size miniatures and an original size, I don't know what is going on but both bags and 2 pack have tasted funny. Almost like the peanuts where burnt before made into peanut butter. Hope it gets better!
--------------------
The classic peanut butter cup is perfect - please stop trying to come up with other types of this ! I tried the "thin" ones & was very disappointed. I think maybe the factory just ran out of peanut butter & someone decided....well, lets not waste the chocolate & see what we can do....
--------------------
I just bought a bag of Reese's miniature cups and it seems like every cup has five wrappers on it and I'm very upset because I can't eat more than I want without choking on a wrapper!
--------------------
This boi frozen got me actin stupid, outta my mind! If you've never tossed a Resse's in the fridge, then I feel sorry for you. Do it now! It's a once in a life time experience. When you open your eyes it will over before you know it. You'll wanna go back to the moment where you sunk your teeth into chocolatey, peanut butter goodness in cup form. S-L-A-P that's a Reese's.
--------------------
My husband and I are almost daily consumers of wonderful traditional Reese's Cups. Something has happened to the flavor. This flavor change isn't pleasant and has been in several packages from different stores. Has the recipe changed or is this just a temporary problem?
--------------------
If your Reese cups get any smaller you can package them in the MiniReeses packaging ................
--------------------
What happened to the Reese snack size? I buy the Reese snack size bags regularly and the previous four bags I bought were terrible, no where near their usual delicious taste. Since these were so bad I reluctantly bought some from another store and they tasted great. What happened? My rating on those four bags is poor. I would not recommend Reese on those four bags.
--------------------
I recently splurge and got a 12 pack. I figured I would have a yummy treat over the next few days and share with my son. When I opened the first one I noticed it was markedly smaller than I was used to. Disappointing but not a deterrent. Then I popped it in my mouth and noticed an unpleasant test. I thought it was a fluke so I ate a second. Nope. Maybe it was something on my hands. So fast forward a few days and I walked my hands so I could make sure nothing messes up my treat. But that unpleasant taste was still there. That'sa deal breaker for me. I don't care that they make me fat if they taste good. But these did not. Guess it will be good for my waist line!
--------------------
I bought a 35.6 oz bag of peanut butter cup miniatures and there is an unpleasant taste to them, is there a different oil or something in use in the recipe? It leaves a terrible after taste which ruins it for me. What a waste!
--------------------
There is no better candy than a Reese's peanut butter cup! But, it is so disappointing to open the package and find your piece of candy has shrunk to half the size it used to be. So disappointing!!!
--------------------
The texture has changed and they taste gross. I dont know what ingredients the company has changed but the reeses cups taste horrible. Very poor quality lately
--------------------
I'm the biggest fan of eating the best peanut butter and chocolate treat on the planet.... I would love to see y'all make big cups in white chocolate keep up this yummy little treat
--------------------
One word, disappointed! 50 plus years of enjoying this treat. It was the amount of filling to the chocolate that made this treat most delicious back in the day. Not even close now. I'm out.
--------------------
RECEES ARE THE BEST.I ABSOLUTELEY LOVE THEM THEY GO WITH EVERYTHING AND THE BEST THING IS THAT THEY ARE HARD ON THE OUTSIDE AND SOFT AND CREAMY IN THE INSIDE .
--------------------
The changes made in how the chocolate and peanut butter are combined makes Reese's peanut butter cups UNACCEPTABLE! They no longer taste, or feel the same. You also have decreased their size. I'M NO LONGER CONSUMING THEM, YOU CAN KEEP THEM! What a shame when foolish corporate men get not so bright ideas. YOU RUINED THEM!!!
--------------------
I don't know how anyone could leave a bad review because Reese's are amazing!!!! I absolutely love Reese's!!!! :) My fianc√© and I always fight over Reese's. I usually have candy at my house for guests and Reese's are always the first candy to be all ate up by guests. Reese's is always the most requested candy or treat people want me to buy. A couple of days ago I had bought a bag of Reese's eggs. Woke up the next morning and the whole bag was eaten by my fianc√© and his brother. I was genuinely upset that all the Reese's Peanut Butter eggs had been eaten up so my fianc√© gave me more money to go out and get another bag of Reese's Easter Eggs. Lol I don't play when it comes to my Reese's! Reese's Peanut Butter Cups has always been my favorite!!!!

--------------------
I don't really like it but it's honestly really good for trips
--------------------
I don't really like it but it's honestly really good for trips
--------------------
Growing up this was a must have always. Whenever I walked into a store of some sort I would always leave with a Reese's. As a little kid I went on these long 8 hour road trips and you best believe I had a Reese's with me.
--------------------
I've been eating Reese's cups for more than fifty years. I make cakes, brownies. ice cream and cookies using Reese's cups. They are the best!
--------------------
Love em
--------------------
You made them thinner and your not sorry. Did you lower the price by the same amount that you cut the ingredients? Not from what I've seen at the grocery store. I'm no longer a customer. Thank you.
--------------------
Purchased 2 large bags of Reese's peanut butter cups for a trip to go out of town with and was very disappointed that they were stale, like dry peanut dust. Usually enjoy your products.
--------------------
Something went wrong in the process of my Reese's peanut butter cup standard size.
--------------------
The Reeses Big Cup is the best candy you will ever eat. 200 calories and 20 grams of sugar! Wow. !!
--------------------
The larger the better!
--------------------
It's the perfect ratio of peanut butter to chocolate. I crave these more than any other chocolate, any other candy. It's to the point my man questions if I love these more than him some days.
--------------------
Opened the package today and these are the driest inside of the peanut butter I've ever seen. The peanut butter was crumbling off and tasted terrible.
--------------------
its so good and its little healthy
--------------------
I use to love eating these everyday but now not so much the freshness isn't there no more. Some of the cups are hard! The cost went up but the quality went dow!
--------------------
Literally the perfect combination. My favorite since I tried.
--------------------
Awesome if fresh but here lately the been sending out the ones about to expire in a month. Then they will have a crusty white film and taste old. Yuck
--------------------
Reese's peanut butter cups are a fun and delicious treat. I love these individually wrapped cups that are easy to put in a lunch bag or snack on at home. I grew up with Reese's peanut butter cups, they are my mom's favorite, and still enjoy them as an adult and share them with my own family. These cups have the perfect balance of chocolate and peanut butter. I would recommend these to my friends and family.
--------------------
I was so happy when I received The Peanut Butter Cups bc not only are they my absolute favorite I felt like it was Christmas when I received these in the mail. I've always preferd the Peanut Butter Cups over the Regular Reese's cups bc it was just enough Peanut Butter and Chocolate.
--------------------
Chocolate and peanut butter, the best combination! Individually wrapped so you don't have to eat them all at once, but they probably won't last long if you share with friends. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to satisfy their sweet tooth.
--------------------
Who doeant love peanut butter cups?? I so as well S my children, they are an amazing snack as well as a treat!!!
--------------------
The peanut butter cups were delicious! A big bag of heaven for sure. I am a huge chocolate person, and nothing beats having one or five peanut butter cups! They got it right mixing chocolate with peanut butter! Hands down one of my all time favorite that never gets old!
--------------------
These Peanut Butter Cups were delicious. They were enjoyed by the whole family. They had the right amount of chocolate and peanut butter.

--------------------
Loved the peanut butter cups they were so good . Milk chocolate with peanut butter filled ! My family and I enjoyed them so much!! Thanks
--------------------
These are great compared to other peanut butter cups I've tried. Sweet and not too dry.
--------------------
Always great! A classic favorite with a good balance between the peanut butter and chocolate.
--------------------
They are a great snack to take to work.
--------------------
Though personally I prefer the minis I will never turn down a reeces peanut butter cup. Let me say I am not a fan of any other peanut butter chocolate mixture, not in ice cream, shakes or anything just the cup. I had to share these mouth watering tasty treats with the kids because they saw.me.open the box lol. They were sent in exchange.for.an honest review and we.will definitely purchase in the future

This was epic. I love Peanut Butter Cups. The package was nice and secure and I was so excited when I received and opened it. They arrived retaining their shape and more importantly their taste.

I like the big recesse just as much as the little ones bigger taste of chocolate and peanut butter in one and creamy
--------------------
Did the Kit Kat chocolate change? The chocolate tastes waxy and flavorless to me now. I had a Kit Kat from Canada earlier in the year, and it was MUCH better. Reluctant to buy again and it‚Äôs a shame because Kit Kat‚Äôs are one of my favorite treats.
--------------------
As my daughter's Oreo obsession has come to a halt, she has now moved on to Kit Kats. I have bought this exact product for the last several weeks almost every week. These Kit Kats are always very, very fresh. My husband, who can pinpoint a Kit Kat's birth date and reminiscences about Kit Kats he had in the eighties totally approves of these and has asked for more.
--------------------
Addictive and my favorite ever! Have been waiting my whole life for this. Lol would pick big Kit Kat over my husband ‚ôÄÔ∏è
--------------------
Nothing gets me more excited than eating a Kit Kat Bar. Their taste and texture are absolutely unbeatable, and they are absolutely delightful to break open and eat. I'm always excited around Halloween, because not only do I get to splurge on regular Kit Kat Bars, but I also get to buy the dark chocolate Kit Kat Bars. One item on my bucket list is to visit Japan and try as many Kit Kat Bars as possible. The last time I visited L.A. I brought home several bags of the Green Tea flavor. I brought them into my office and they were all gone before lunch.
--------------------
Just at a mini kitkat that was all chocolate, no cookie inside. Even the production machines aren't perfect. Just letting you know. Still love them though.
--------------------
These little KIT KAT Assorted Candy Bars are the bomb. I get my sugar fix and you have three varieties of milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white chocolate..
--------------------
My family enjoys devouring these Kit Kat miniature Assortments regularly. There is really something for everyone! My husband is obsessed with the white chocolate, im obsessed with the dark chocolate, and my kids like the regular milk chocolate Kit Kats. I can not remember a time where Kit Kats were not in our lives. They are the perfect size for a tiny snack, or a great dessert.
--------------------
I love the assortment you get in this bag. This is perfect for everyone in the family with different tastes. I like to add these to baking or just as a quick pick me up snack on the go.
--------------------
These are so delicious. Such a huge bag too! My personal favorites was the dark chocolate. Perfect size for bite size snacking!
--------------------
I loved every single Kit kat that was in this package. It was nice and smooth to the very last bite. There is truly nothing better than a classic kit kat bar. If there is one thing in this world that you can not go wrong with, it is a Kit Kat bar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I like hot the KitKat water bars are a good size and not too small [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is my favorite Kit Kat Product. I love to remove the wafer layers when eating. They are great to keep in my fridge as a week end "reward." I have to hide these from my husband, though, because they go fast. It is very hard to eat just one bar. I will be rebuying and would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have always enjoyed this size kit Kat even since I was a child. It is the perfect size to share or eat some and save the rest for later. I was not aware there was any type of sampling box but when asked to do this I was very excited to give my opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I was NOT expecting a 6 pack of full-size Kit Kat bars but wow, was it a nice surprise! They were put to good use in a late graduation gift that I was preparing!

--------------------
What can I say I love chocolate! And this was a good buy, it had a lot of my favorite chocolates and I will definitely buy it again!!!
--------------------
Who doesn‚Äôt love a big mix of chocolate candy?! This bag has it all. For someone who loves chocolate but also loves variety, this was a hit. The snickers was perfect when I needed something a little salty! Twix helped satisfy that crunch craving! Milky Way was perfect for when I needed a little caramel and Three Musketeers is just a good soft chocolate bar! I loved this mixed bag!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This was such an AWESOME delivery!! No surprise, my kids loved it - but, so did my hubby and I. We put some of them in the freezer, and used others crumbled up as toppings. You will not regret this buy!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My Grandkids LOVED having this little Bag of snacks around! The bars were just the right size for them to snack on thru out the day! I would recommend this product to anyone with children ages 3 and up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This a good mix of chocolate to give out for Halloween. They are minis so you can confidently give multiples but also a variety so there will be the ones you want to eat and the rest to give away. Great little bite sized pieces when you need just a quick sugar fix. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This size is the perfect size , just enough to fulfill the urge for chocolate. Al the popular varieties , Snickers, Twix, and M & M's. Perfect for the Halloween trick or treaters. This size , the fun size is my favorite, enough to get it the perfect snack size, highly recommend for Halloween. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love SNICKERS, TWIX, MILKY WAY & 3 MUSKETEERS. They come in little packages and you can take a few here and there. My favorite of all time is three musketeers. They taste like the bigger candy bars but yet you don‚Äôt have to have a lot and you can save for later [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
All the classics in one bag! What is better than that? It's awesome to have the variety, and it's also great that they are not so large so you can have one of each if you're not giving them all away :) Individually wrapped, so they're good to go for Halloween! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I recieved this a few weeks ago and I (and my family in the house) DEVOURED this bag of candy. It was a decent sized bag and had a bunch of different chocolate candy bars and brands so it would be great for Halloween to hand out some chocolate candy and some sweet candy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
How could I even review these when they were gone shortly after I opened the bag? I barely got a chance to savor the crunch of a Twix as I licked the flavorful caramel from the top. I slowly bit through the thick mixture of Carmel and nuts as I enjoyed the texture of the Snickers bar. I closed my eyes as I snapped my KitKat in half to experience the layers of goodness as I bit through them. Was I dreaming? Is this real? Have I really eaten the whole bag?

I bought this because it gives me all the different mix of chocolate that I need. My kids love it and the quality is always there. These candy's do hold up to the heat as long as it is only briefly. Also keeping them in the fridge helps keep them fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

What‚Äôs not to love about the Mini Mix of snickers, Twix, Milky Way and 3 musketeers? My husband has an insatiable sweet tooth, so these treats were not safe in our home. I found the package next to his recliner. So much for Halloween. These really are the perfect size for when you just need a little something. Great variety of candy. Will be buying more.

This is my honest review for the Snickers, M&Ms & Twix Minis. First of all I'm a chocolate lover and the minis for just enough to fulfill that love. I like the fact that they come in the smaller sizes so they are sharable. I have a few kid's in my apartment complex, so I shared with them. They enjoyed them as much as I did. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I originally wanted this candy for Halloween, but my children got into it first. They were very pleased with the different candies that were in the bag. And i think it would be perfect for trick or treating children. I'll be purchasing more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

All of the candies that come in this variety are super yummy! That all seemed rationed out evenly. These one bite candies are perfect for small children or to satisfy your sweet tooth without all the calories of a full sized candy bar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I‚Äôm a chocolate lover and this bag is great. It has 3 of my favorite chocolates- M&M‚ÄôS, Twix and Snickers. They‚Äôre bite sized and perfectly sized.

As a picky easter I do not want a random mix of chocolate that I'm going to skip over half of, but this bag is incredible. It's all the good stuff and no junk! This goes quick in my house so I have to hide it or my husband would eat all the Snickers before I got home. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It‚Äôs great to have a bag of all our favorites. The convenient size is perfect for all our grandkids (and the parents). We always have candy out and the large size last long. They tend to eat them all so we know it‚Äôs a hit after a long weekend. I love M&Ms, Twix and Snickers so sometimes I have to hide a few. Mars and Wrigley have been a trusted name throughout our lives. Enjoy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Snickers, Twix, Milky Way & 3 Musketeers, Minis mix was a great selection of different chocolates. I loved the variety so I could enjoy a different taste whenever I wanted a sweet treat. It was great for days when I needed a quick snack for energy or just to reward myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this bag and the assortment is great. I eat almost every type except one. I leave those for my fiancee. Quality chocolate, perfect size piece if you just want a little snack. 3 musketeers just has a bit to much chocolate for me. I love the middle though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Snickers, M&M‚Äôs & Twix pack was fantastic for birthday party gift bags. The bag contains M&M‚Äôs in both peanut and plain. The Snickers are about a two bite size as is the Twix. There were plenty of candid in the bag so I was able to do gift bags for seven kids and still have some left over. It‚Äôs a great way to allow the little ones to have candy without it being too much. Moms are happy because the kids are happy. It‚Äôs a win win! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love these little mini candy bars. They are the perfect size to have a little treat but not go overboard. I love the flavors Twix, Milky Way, Snickers, and Three Musketeers.

OMG!! Who doesn't like candy!! I opened the bag right away and my family dug right in. It was fresh and soft and tasted great.

This was a perfect mix of my favorites. Everything was fresh and the right size bag for where I live for Halloween. Unfortunately the bag did not make it for Halloween. This is a smaller size bag so if you tend to not get a ton of trick or treaters this is perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

--------------------
I got this candy to see what kind of candy I wanted to hand out to children this Halloween. This candy is the perfect size for Halloween. This candy is also tasty and filled perfectly, so you can have the perfect bite of candy. I also love that it is bite sized. It is good on a whim went you just want a bite of something sweet. It will also be good for younger children who tend not to eat all of there candy because of the size. It saves on wasted candy. I would recommend that everyone but this for Halloween because it is the perfect candy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I bought the SNICKERS, TWIX, MILKY WAY & 3 MUSKETEERS, Minis Mix Chocolate Halloween Candy Bag, 9.87 Oz for the family to enjoy. There is nothing better then this Mini Mix, it has everyones favorite chocolate in it and in nice bite size. I recomend this nice treat to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This candy variety bag is awesome. It has all of my favorite chocolate covered treats and all of them taste super good. The bag has twix, m &m's, peanut m&m's and snickers. I especially love that the twix have both RIGHT and LEFT bars. Another cool thing is that my bag had more than 55 pieces. I imagine that is an error, but still super nice. I originally wanted to rate this 3 stars, because the amount of candy of each variety is very inconsistent and no where near even. The bag had 9 packets of peanut m&ms, 22 snickers, 14 regular m&ms, and 11 left twix, and 2 right twix. If you are a snickers lover then this perfect for you! I opted to rate it 4 stars instead of 3 due to the 3 extra candy pieces in my bag. Overall, this is a great mix of candy, especially if you love snickers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Absolutely our Best Buy. This mix is finally the right one for our family. Too many times in the past I‚Äôve bought a snack sized mix bag of candy only to have one or two of the offerings eaten. This mix is great there is something everyone likes in our family and finally none left that no one likes. We will buy this one again and again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This has to be hands down the best mixture of candy chocolate around. The bag lasted me over a month with two of us in the home. It‚Äôs a great price and overall who doesn‚Äôt love chocolate! You can never get tried because there are so many options of candy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

What can I say?! This is just a wonderful mix of candies. Perfect bite sized pieces. I leave a candy bowl on my office desk and I am a hit with my coworkers. Yum yum yum! Everyone loves the classics! 50 pieces last for a while, highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Well the packaging is pretty straightforward - all the candies in this will be some kind of chocolate/caramel mix. I'm a big fan of both chocolate and caramel so the selection here was pretty much spot on for me. Twix and Snickers are pretty well known and most people should know whether or not they like them (I definitely do). The Milky Way Caramel was pretty good as well - it seems to replace the nougat in a normal Milky Way with just more caramel. I wasn't a huge fan of the caramel M&M's. They didn't taste bad but the textures felt a bit off with the thin candy shell outside - slightly firm chocolate shell within that - and then a pretty chewy consistency of caramel. Probably my least favorite of the pack. That all being said I would get this again just for the other 3 candies in the pack. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I esp love Twix and Milky Way. The small sizes are great for portion control. The mix is great-a favorite for everyone! The variety pack was a big hit and I would recommend it greatly! Good value for the bag. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I'm a caramel fiend! With the recent work from home orders, I bought this variety pack to keep around the house, making up for the snacks I was missing out on at the office.

If you love caramel, this is the perfect assortment bag! The bag does seem to contain mostly snickers; I wish there was a way to more appropriately give a more even amount of each candy. Bonus is that everything but the Twix is gluten free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is an absolute hit at my house with my family. The candy is just the ones that we love all in one. I love the portion sizes so that you can reward your children, but they not get a full size amount of chocolate. They also work great for lunch boxes and for when on the go. With the 55 pieces you have enough candy to last a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The bag has a nice mix of chocolate candies Snickers, M&Ms and Twix . All my family members and guests liked these chocolates so much and it ran out in no time.

I am a HUGE chocolate lover I get a sweet tooth for chocolate. This was definitely awesome to have whenever my sweet tooth acted up. I love how there are 5 different choices in the bag. I love to put them in the fridge or freezer to keep them cold and from melting. The small size is perfect for when you just want something small and sweet. So if you have a sweet tooth and love chocolate this is definitely for you!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Mixed Mars Minis Size Variety Bag is a great family sized bag for those who eat in moderation or balance and simply want a light indulgent treat. One, here or there, would last a pretty decent span of time. However, if one is a chocolate lover, this bag will NOT be enough: (1) because this bag is a tease (they are minis!) and (2) because fifty pieces of candy can go quickly if one is sharing these things. Overall, I would always recommend Mars chocolate because it's the best, but this variety pack REALLY needs some Peanut M&Ms and may be some fun-sized candy and I'll be sold. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Ummm, yes. Would buy again in a heartbeat. Chocolate and peanut butter are a weakness of mine. LOVE peanut butter M&M's. Wish the peanut butter Snicker's was fun size instead of snack size, but that is the only thing to complain about. I just had to eat more than one to satisfy my craving...

Well first off who doesn't love a good chocolate. I know I do especially when they are from fantastic brands that use only he highest quality ingredients. You can tell the quality of the chocolate by the taste and man these don't disappoint!! I am a sucker for quality chocolate and this variety bag has all my faves. The variety is fantastic with something for everyone to enjoy. The peanuts in the Snicker's are always tasty and crunchy not at all soggy. The Carmel in the twix and Snicker's just is amazing and oh so stringy and yummy. I like that it came with two varieties of m&Ms too as I enjoy switching them up. The size of this bag is even perfect to bring for a get together as it's huge or just to keep at home to nosh on when you feel the craving. Overall fantastic candy brands in this variety bag .

My whole family loved this bag of peanut and peanut butter Mars candies. It contained an assortment of Peanut M&M's, Peanut Butter M&M's, Snickers and Peanut Butter Snickers. I had never tried Peanut Butter M&Ms or Peanut Butter Snickers before. The M&Ms became my favorite. The only thing I didn't like was that the regular Snickers were the "fun size" but the Peanut Butter Snickers were just small squares, smaller than the regular Snickers. I'm not a huge Snickers fan, but thought the Peanut Butter version was good and would have liked them in the same size as the regular Snickers. All in all, a great back of candy if you're a peanut/peanut butter lover like me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love this assortment. Provides the perfect amount of sweet and saltiness. The M&M peanut butter tastes better than the M&M peanuts in my opinion. They remind me of Reese‚Äôs pieces but better since each bite has more peanut filling. Highly recommend peanut butter lovers to try this one out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

First, I want to talk about the shipping. This was shipped with three ice packs in an insulated(?) bag. This survived the Nevada heat without any problems!

We both love caramel candy so when we saw this bag full of different caramel candies we had to give it a try. Mars bars, Twix, Snickers and M&M‚Äôs. We were not disappointed , except there were not enough Mars bars! 55 pieces and individually wrapped. Just the right size for my husbands lunch bag. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I was highly satisfied with my 55 piece caramel lovers candy. The packaging was very efficient; the candy was in a Thermo- bag with ice packs so the candy was not melted. The taste was fresh. I like the fun size bars because I can grab just a couple for my desk and it‚Äôs like a portion control; and the variety is a bonus too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I really liked the variety of this bag of candy. The kids and us were all able to find something we liked in this bag. This product is very satisfying and fulfilling and makes everyone happy. Everyone's sweet tooth is satisfied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The candy was so good both of my kids loves them and i will start buying this kind of candy now on the bag of candy didnt last long in my house its already almost gone that is how good it was and how much we loved it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Perfect stocking stuffer when you don‚Äôt want to give too much candy!
--------------------
This is, by far, the best chocolate bar EVER!!!!! I'm addicted!! Please made minis for Halloween!!!
--------------------
This candy to me is just ok. To me it tastes more like sugar then chocolate and its a little too rich for my body to handle. I much prefer the plain M&Ms
--------------------
I dont know why but the mini M&Ms are my favorite, I like them better than the big ones. Especially in this candy bar. The chocolate is really good and creamy especially with the mini M&Ms. 10 out of 10 recommend this candy bar.
--------------------
Love love love! Yummy!!! Im a chocolate lover and my kid is obsessed with m&ms! Would recommend always! Perfect for just a little square at a time to help the cravings
--------------------
I was surprised with how good this actually was. I prefer the crunch one but my husband loves the peanut one. I have bought these a few times.
--------------------
These m&m candy bars are one of my all time favorites. This milk chocolate bar is soo smooth and flavorful.
--------------------
I've always loved M&M's but it wasn't until recently that I found these chocolate bars. I've seen them in a variety of flavors and my personal favorite is the almond milk chocolate.
--------------------
I wasnt a huge fan of the M&M Milk Chocolate Bar. The actual bar tasted similar to chocolate youd receive from an off brand. I think the candy bar is overpriced and does not live up to the quality of M&M products. I wouldnt recommend this product. Thank you for reading my review. Hakuna Matada!
--------------------
It was okay. A different taste as a bar. I rather have it in a bag. Maybe it would be different.
--------------------
This is one of my daughters favorite treats and mine too lol its so creamy yet crunchy and its just great!!!
--------------------
Very very good I had a bad day but this make it all better I love milk chocolate and m&m are my favorite things to eat M&MS Milk Chocolate Bar with M&M's Minis
--------------------
I thought it tasted good, but something about it was weird. I think its not really necessary. If I want m&ms Ill just get some m&ms. There are other chocolate bars that I would buy first. Before I would buy this one.
--------------------
This chocolate bar is any m&m minis fan's dream, personally I find it very comparable to a crunch bar in that the texture of this chocolate bar has elements that make it crunchier. The flavor itself is more or less underwhelming as there is no rich flavor of chocolate and it is more of sweeter chocolate.
--------------------
These are so tasty! & addicting. I bought them to put in my kids‚Äô pencil box as a back to school ‚Äúgoody bag.‚Äù The chocolate is so much and delicious and the added crunch of the M&M minis make it even better. They are divided in to mini squares for you to break off for portion control, but I feel like it just adds to the addiction. After eating every little square you think ‚Äúokay, just one more‚Äù until the whole bar is gone.
--------------------
I love M&Ms but theres something about the minis that I adore! This is such a yummy candy bar with the delicious chocolate you know and love with the addition of the great mini M&Ms!! This is definitely a favorite to grab
--------------------
DELICIOUS!!! Shared this on a road trip and it was gone in a matter of seconds everyone loved it! Affordable and great crunch from the m&m minis inside
--------------------
They are good, but weird. Tooooooo. Chocolatey (yes, i said it) and the textures dont compliment each other.
--------------------
Maybe best candy bar ever. Perf combination. Simple choc with mini m&ms. Cant control myself!!!
--------------------
I really lived the little extra crunch that the mini M&Ms gave the candy bar. The flavor is very good and it doesnt taste like cheap chocolate at all. Adding a little crunch to a candy bar was a very good idea. Keep up the good work M&M!!
--------------------
How could you not love this candy bar its chocolate with more chocolate. You take your first bite and the outer layer of chocolate melts away and reveals a surprise of a tiny M&M
--------------------
I took my daughter to the candy shop her favorite place. And while she was picking out her candy aisle found this chocolate bar. After dinner I ate the whole thing and did not want to share a bite. But I did give her one little piece this is definitely my new favorite ba[product:m&ms-milk-chocolate-bar-with-m&ms-minis]r
--------------------
Lots of chocolate flavor and the minis in the bar makes it taste even better this is my favorite bar
--------------------
I am so addicted to these candy bars! They taste amazing and the mini m&ms in them are great.
--------------------
What a great combination! Chocolate bar and m and m's! These are so tasty and addictive! So dangerous around me because I could eat the whole bar in one sitting! I like how they can separate in to little squares and you can try and eat it moderately! Great for a treat!
--------------------
Adding chocolate candies to a chocolate bar, such a simple idea, but oh so goooddd. the candy adds the perfect little bit of crunchiness to the smooth creamy chocolate bar. Delish!
--------------------
Another delish delight from M&Ms! Rich milk chocolate accented by yummy mini M&Ms. M&MS Milk Chocolate Bar with M&M's Minis is a great snack!!
--------------------
The mini M&Ms are my absolute favorite variety of the yummy sugar coated candy brand! Putting them in a smooth rich milk chocolate bar simply enhances the deliciousness!
--------------------
Whoever thought of this chocolate bar is a genius. Its so good! Its like eating a bar of chocolate and a handful of mini m&ms at the same time! The chocolate is creamy and smooth and the m&ms are crunchy and the two together is a great combo.
--------------------
5/5 stars! Amazing! I love these, theyre my favorite candy bar! If I am out and carving chocolate, I look for these immediately!
--------------------
I love both chocolate and m&ms so I got this and it was good at first, but after the first few bites it became easy to sweet for me personally.
--------------------
BEST. CREATION. MNMS. HAS. EVER. MADE. absolutely delicious. Like hands down best flavor of chocolate aside from Hersheys.
--------------------
This is a really good chocolate bar. I just began purchasing them not that long ago but its a good tasting treat.
--------------------
I like this candy when Im watching a movie or a show it the right snack to have love it
--------------------
The chocolate bar is just as good as the regular candy. They are great. Easy to eat and just very delicious. I love these
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite chocolate bar! Its so fun with the m&ms inside and its so colorful and it tastes amazing! I love the cute packaging and the price is great!!
--------------------
This is a good M&M chocolate bar. The milk chocolate with the mini M&Ms give a nice crunch to a smooth rich chocolate bar!
--------------------
I think this product has to much chocolate and it is affordable but I have not go with this one I would rather go with the yellow one with the nuts in it I dont not recommend it to others only if you love chocolate a lot.
--------------------
Love these! Perfect amount of chocolate and m&ms only downfall is they are hard to find! Other than that they are the perfect sweet treat
--------------------
Theyre M&M in chocolate bars . if youre a chocoholic, the temptation to eat more than one at a time may be difficult to resist!
--------------------
This chocolate bar is super good! Its great to share with a friend and the mini m&ms in it are so good!!
--------------------
These are so good and hard to find anywhere else! I grab one every time I‚Äôm at the store :) YUM
--------------------
These M&M Milk Chocolate Bars are my new true love! I could eat a full bar in one they are smooth and a rich chocolate, plus they have mini M&Ms! Whenever I stop by the gas station I grab a couple of these so I dont run out!
--------------------
I love these bars! The chocolate pieces literally melt in your mouth. Delicious! They arent sold everywhere though so sometimes its hard to find.
--------------------
I was a bit skeptical of a chocolate bar from M&Ms, but its soo good. The chocolate isnt too sweet or bitter and the little M&Ms in it make it taste even better.
--------------------
When I want to treat myself I always buy one of these chocolate bars and for the price they're really great.
--------------------
This chocolate bar is delicious. I was hesitant on the way the chocolate would taste when I purchased it. However, it was so creamy and delicious! It was nice to have little m&ms spread throughout the bar
--------------------
Love these!!!!!! Sooo good. Love the mini m&ms. My kids also love them. Great value for a sweet treat. Definitely will get these again.
--------------------
If you loooove chocolate go and buy this bar. You won't regret it. It is the perfect combination of mini M&M's and more chocolate. Be ready to indulge in a chocolate coma afterward. Perfect snack for a movie or for your cravings. Buy more than one and thank me later.
--------------------
This is such an addicting bar of chocolate! they're an affordable price and the mini M&M's just really set the flavor over the top. Personally I like the blue packaged bar better than this one, it also has rice crisps in it. I will definitely buy more of both in the future.
--------------------
This is my new favorite treat. I love it so much. Smooth chocolate and then a little crunch with the M&M's!
--------------------
These are so good! The chocolate is perfect. I could eat these all the time. Super creamy and delicious.
--------------------
This chocolate bar is sooo much better than a Hershey's chocolate bar. It is very creamy and melts in your mouth. You get a slight crunch from the m&ms which makes this even better. As someone who isn't a big fan of chocolate, I would definitely recommend it.
--------------------
The bar itself is big and tastes like chocolate but the mini Candy's in it give a very bitter contrast. Was not a favorite at my house.
--------------------
this chocolate bar is my fav I always pick one up at my local grocery store. Its so sweet and indulgent definitely a good snack.
--------------------
Really love these bars. I have liked every one that I have tried. Definitely a sharing size. Provides a fun texture with the mini m&ms in the bar. Would definitely buy again and highly recommend.
--------------------
I love m&ms. There is a lot of chocolate and mini m&ms that give it a little crunch. It is a bit pricy but it is worth it. The flavor is great, I absolutely enjoyed it. I would highly recommend if youre looking for something new to try.
--------------------
Love m&ms! This bar is perfect! Lots of chocolate and a little crunch from the candy shell! They are a little expensive so I dont buy them often but its definitely a nice treat!
--------------------
I was excited to try this product and it definitely met my expectations. The bar is quite big in size and the chocolate is good. I enjoyed the crunch of the mini M&Ms and think it had a perfect balance. I would purchase again.
--------------------
After M&Ms came out with their chocolate bars, I am obsessed! Literally so smooth and delicious. The bar is shaped and carved into an M&M and Im eating these every week!
--------------------
The taste isn't bad but candy came broken! I would like a whole candy bar, not 2 or 3 halves! Target does not package some items correctly! Items are thrown in a box, not securely packaged in plastic bags or tied with Rubber bands.
--------------------
Chocolate overload in a good way of course!!!! A chocolate bar with M&M's is just chocolate dipped in chocolate and put in chocolate lol. I love the M&M chocolate bars especially the mint one. These are good if you are craving chocolate but you definitely can't eat the whole thing which is good!
--------------------
I didnt know these were a thing until I had one. It's amazing. A chocolate bar made out of chocolate . There are 3 flavors and they are all delicious.
--------------------
I love chocolate so I highly enjoyed munching on this delightful treat my sister hates it though
--------------------
There is something abosolutely mind blowing in this chocolate you get a little bit of everything in one bite no need to eat multiple candies at the same time.
--------------------
This was tasty, decent; I definitely would prefer M&M's or chocolate alone, but still a nice little treat.
--------------------
Chocolate is my favorite candy and this bar literally encompasses everything I've ever wanted in a chocolate bar. I've always loved the M&M's Minis and a chocolate bar in general but when I saw that these were combined I knew I had to try it. I'm so happy I did because it is the perfect combination of taste and texture!
--------------------
Awesome candies ! There's absolutely something magical in these that will make you crave for having another one ! My daughter just love these
--------------------
As said before milk chocolate is my fave I love m&ms a lot and the chocolate bar ma it better when they first come out with it I was so happy
--------------------
Really great tasting chocolate with extra crunchy bits when you get to the m&ms. Maybe for some it may be too much chocolate in one package but for a chocoholic like myself, it is a perfect combination. Yum
--------------------
I truly love this candy! Whenever I'm having a bad day I stop by the store to grab one of these. I obsessed with how the chocolate melts in my mouth. I tend to buy and eat this product very often. The chocolate is pleasantly sweet and lusciously smooth.
--------------------
I have a huge sweet tooth and love this candy so much! Would highly recommend at any time!
--------------------
Basically this is just a chocolate bar with more chocolate. Not worth the extra price, just get yourself a good chocolate bar of a higher quality or just get some M&Ms
--------------------
I loved the m&ms candy bars when I was a kid in the late 90s, and I was always so upset that they took them away! Then I found these and was literally so happy! Super nostalgic and yummy!! Exactly like the originals :)
--------------------
Its good but I just dont know that its my favorite. I like m&ms but the chocolate bar in this is just not my favorite
--------------------
I was wary of this at first but this is now really the only chocolate bar I eat. I love mini M&Ms on their own so putting them in a plain chocolate bar (which helps spice it up anyways, plain chocolate bars are boring) is a win-win
--------------------
the chocolate is so rich and irresistible and just melts in my mouth! this is my second time buying one and its gone in an hour! good price for the best chocolate bar!! it also has mini m&ms inside the bar which is even better!
--------------------
This is the best bar. The chocolate is just addictive. I love it.
--------------------
Love these! Whenever i find these i grab atleast two. I love putting them in the freezer and eating them cold
--------------------
I love mini m&ms and what better idea then adding them into a bar of chocolate! You cant go wrong with m&ms
--------------------
Chocolate coated with chocolate? How do you say no trying such a thing. Unfortunately it missed the mark. I would prefer eating the two items independently, but nice try :)
--------------------
I really like these !! Im glad they made these. I like the little bit of crunch the m & ms provide
--------------------
A while ago I had saw these and I decided to try it it was so good true milk chocolate flavor and has m&ms inside its super good all the flavors they have a good . I would definitely buy again. Try it you wont regret it !
--------------------
the best thing you will taste and best thing i have rver bought my dad brings them for me since my childhood and i love this product won't chang3 anything in this product the flavor is so rich and amazing and it's my definite repurchase every time
--------------------
Such a great way to enjoy m&ms! Its a happy little candy bar that makes you feel like a party inside your mouth!
--------------------
I have a weakness for chocolate. Its my go to sweet! And this kind is so delicious and honestly one of my favorites!
--------------------
This is really good! Im crazy for M&M! I always have in my bedroom lol! M&M Will be my Easter this year!
--------------------
I didn't think M&Ms could get any better until I tried this M&M candy bar. Wow was my reaction this is Awesome! I think this would make a great surprise for anyone.
--------------------
this chocolate bar is an all time favorite, its the perfect combination of my favorite things and a great way to treat myself! it is a great value and i always get these when i can. im always craving this candy!
--------------------
This chocolate was good and satisfying but it needs more mini m&m's in it! It was sweet but not too sweet. The chocolate was very creamy and smooth. Loved the flavor and texture. I would buy again but hope they'll add more m&m's.
--------------------
I LOVE M&M's Milk Chocolate Bar with M&M's Minis! I usually cannot go without eating the entire bar in one sitting because it's so yummy. It's a big chocolate bar with mini M&M's, which gives it a nice twist. I usually put mine in the refrigerator or freezer and eat it cold.
--------------------
As someone that isn't typically a fan of Hershey's bars or M&Ms, I really didn't have high hopes for this hybrid candy bar. It really is surprisingly great though! The crunch of the M&Ms gives the bar some nice variety. The only thing that would make this even better is if it was made of dark chocolate.
--------------------
One of my favorites so yummy and delicious absolutely love the mini m&ms in it too absolutely love
--------------------
I just recently tried this and I'm talking the creaminess and taste of this chocolate is Incredible. It melts very quickly and I love my chocolate super soft. It's a huge candy bar for a good $2.50 and I'd say I'm now addicted to these and well worth the price for the quality of the chocolate and size. The mini M&Ms were a good touch added as well but the chocolate itself of the candy bar is ƒë¬ü¬îƒΩ!!!!
--------------------
It is veryyy chocolatey. This is best eaten cold (aka from the fridge) otherwise it melts really easily.
--------------------
I love peanut m&ms and I love chocolate bars. I do like them together but I feel it was way to sweet. Also had to little m&ms.... i feel like this could be a much better chocolate bar/ snack if there was MORE m&ms [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Nothing could be better than adding m&m's into a candy bar. Amazing combination. It had the perfect amount of m&m's added so it was a perfect bite everytime. I really enjoyed the added texture to the candy bar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
These are the new huge candy bars from M&M. They have M&M peanuts candies inside the huge chocolate bar. Every bite is heaven! Two worlds have collided and I love the crash.
--------------------
This is by far one one my favorite chocolate bars. I eat it whenever I can find it. M&ms are my favorite chocolate. This is the perect amount of crunchy and sweet and creamy. Its absolutely delicious
--------------------
This peanut M&M chocolate bar is so good! As soon as you open it~you can see all the candies in it. There is little squares with a M on each one~so you can break off and share with your friends. But once you start eating this,not sure if that is what you want to do. As I ate 1/2 of it just doing the taste test. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
It amazes me that Target charges about $2.00 less than other stores with groceries. One of my favorite chocolate and almond fix. LOL
--------------------
There are holes in the candy bar. I noticed about mouth ago small holed the candy bad. They do not effect, form, fit or and fuction.
--------------------
Candy was old and not edible
--------------------
My favorite as a child!
--------------------
A Hershey's chocolate bar with almond is the closest thing to heaven in earth. The chocolate is smooth and creamy and the almond gives this bar some texture and flavor that complements the chocolate. It is a simple pleasure that never gets old.
--------------------
I have to have my hershey's with almonds everyday. I love the huge bars and the nuggets omg the nuggets are amazing with sometimes 2 plus almonds in each bar. This is my late night fun time eating my hershey's watching my tablet:)!! I'm the reason there's a shortage in my area lol....
--------------------
They were all melted by the time they were delivered. I don't know why they couldn't have been delivered with my 2 hour grocery delivery. If you are going to mail them in the summer I would rather not get them at all.


Thank you
--------------------
This is probably the only candy i would never get tired of eating.
--------------------
thank you for getting this package so fast I really apricate it please stay safe and thank you again

I love Hershey bars and Kisses. They always make me happy.

Great bar as would be expected from Hershey
--------------------
This is delicious chocolate and the ratio of chocolate to almonds is perfect. My one complaint is the thickness of the bar... in a perfect world, it would be just a little heavier. It loses a little mouthfeel because the bar itself is too thin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

--------------------
As a loyal Hershey Customer for many years Ive tried almost all of their products and found nothing compares. Milk Chocolate with Almonds is a risch smooth chocolate with a great seasoned almond nut that delights each other with a punch. Rather sweet instead of salty. Crunchy yet savoring and melts in your mouth. A family favorite refrigerated . Would recommend to any nut chocolate lover. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

These were excellent. The almonds were perfectly crisp and crunchy. They were not soft or overcooked. The chocolate was smooth and silky, and melted perfectly in your mouth. I wish I could have a picture to post, but my family ate them before I could get to it. Delicious, I am so glad I was able to sample this, they were absolutely deliscious.

The Hershey milk chocolate with almond bars are a step up from the average chocolate bar. The almonds add a nice extra crunch to make it more satisfying but it isn't something you could eat more than a few bites of in one sitting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Hershey's kisses with almonds are a nice bite of chocolate with almond bits in them. They are nice to eat if you want just a bite of candy. The almonds add a lot to the chocolate. Who doesn't like a chocolate kiss.

this was my favorite item in my package!! I loved them I put them on my desk and ate them as I was doing my work..
--------------------
This is an old favorite of mine. We shared some of these with some neighbors who also loved them. These are perfect to keep on hand for guests and for extra special treats. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

What can I say, these are the best of the best! Classic Hershey's chocolate - when I think of a chocolate bar these are what I think of. With or without almonds, this is the way chocolate is supposed to taste. Perfect for S'mores and perfect for snacking. They have been around for as long as I have, everyone knows them and everyone loves them. Don't change a thing! Of course I would recommend them, but everyone already knows how great they are! I would buy them without hesitation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Great fun time snake when added to a bowl of pop corn in movie night so yummy

I love Hershey's chocolate with almonds. It's the perfect combination of chocolate and nuts and my family's favorite chocolate bar. The chocolate is smooth and creamy and the nuts are the perfect amount of crunch. I would definitely buy and recommend.

I have had this product before but one can never get enough of the Hersheys with Almonds candy bars. Love 'em! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

One of our favorite things - chocolate and almonds. We sometimes like to melt them & blend them w/ baking chocolate then pouring it over fruit, cereal, etc & topping w/ coconut for an extra special treat. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received a free sample of Hershey's from Viewpoints. I don't often buy Hershey's Kisses. Generally, I'll go straight for the bars. I'll definitely be looking for the Almond Kisses from now on. It's the perfect balance between chocolate and almond, in my opinion.

Hershey's milk chocolate with Almonds bar is one of my favorite chocolates. I love the taste but the reason this was a 4 Star for me was because I couldn't really taste the almonds and that was a minus for me because I Love almonds. It was still good, but the lack of almonds made it taste more sweeter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

These are my, go to chocolate craving solver! The milk chocolate surrounding the almond is absolutely amazing! I always keep a candy jar of these on my coffee table!
--------------------
Love the milk chocolate with almonds. Great size for sharing.
--------------------
Enjoy them thoroughly
--------------------
I have a jar on my desk at work, Hershey Kisses with almonds will be perfect 9n my desk for a pick me up when I have a chocolate fix.
--------------------
I love Hershey Kisses in general but then they add the almonds and it makes it 10 times better because I love almonds as well!!
--------------------
i cant eat these but my children enjoyed them i cant eat the nuts but the chocolate surrounding is always good
--------------------
It's just 4 normal size Reese's. I was expecting like larger reeses when I ordered these. Make them larger with the same ratio!
--------------------
Not a day goes by that I don't treat myself to a delicious Reese's peanut butter cup or 10. They are the best treat that you can ever have.
--------------------
Best friggin Candy out there!!!!! How could anyone give this a low rating? What is wrong with you and your taste buds? Someone destroy them with sand paper as a child?
--------------------
I've been addicted to Reece's Peanut Butter Cups for as long as I remember. They have ALWAYS been my favorite. Back in the day my Easter Basket was nothing but Reece's. Lately though I've been disappointed. They taste nothing like they used to. I'm sure there was a recipe change but why? You took the best candy in the world and turned it into something that Im not sure I'll ever buy again. I'm disappointed and heartbroken.
--------------------
there good but lot of peanut butter i would like to se ore choclet [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
So now, not only does the chocolate taste poorly, the center is like a hardened powder. Never buying these again which is truly a shame as they were always my favorite. Also, you can change the image on the wrapper, it does NOT look like that anymore.
--------------------
I've noticed a difference in the taste/texture of my most recent purchase of this product (Oct 18, 2020). Last purchase was approximately 2-3 months ago and did not notice this consistency at that time. The newer product has more of a waxy consistency which is neither good nor bad to me personally, but it is a noticeable difference. Have there been any recent formulation/manufacturing changes to the product? I know of others who have reported noticing a difference as well.

I bought some Reese‚Äôs Peanut Butter Cups about a week ago, but it tasted like it was made with spoiled milk. I love Reese‚Äôs Peanut Butter Cups but it made me spit it out because of how bad it tasted. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I bought about four packs of peanut butter cups for me and my sister who probably loves them more than anyone else in the family. So when I opened the first pack I see that they‚Äôre deformed and ugly looking but that‚Äôs not what matters because I still ate them driving back home. I started crying because even though they were deformed looking they were still so great. Also the cereal is really good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

is just me....they are getting smaller .....crazy come make them bigger [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I can't get enough of these fatty treats. Hope to steal from my daughters Halloween bag. Super size please
--------------------
What happened?! The cups I used to live taste awful. They almost have a gross honey taste to the chocolate. Our son gagged on one and we didn't know why (its his favourite), so we tasted one and we're shocked at how bad they were!! We had to spit it out! Please check your quality control!! A month prior we bought a package of minis and they tasted bad too - like cheap Easter chocolate (or worse). What happened?!? You need to start reading your 1-star reviews, there is a clear common theme here. Recall your affected products!!!!

The classic peanut butter cup is perfect - please stop trying to come up with other types of this ! I tried the "thin" ones & was very disappointed. I think maybe the factory just ran out of peanut butter & someone decided....well, lets not waste the chocolate & see what we can do....

This boi frozen got me actin stupid, outta my mind! If you've never tossed a Resse's in the fridge, then I feel sorry for you. Do it now! It's a once in a life time experience. When you open your eyes it will over before you know it. You'll wanna go back to the moment where you sunk your teeth into chocolatey, peanut butter goodness in cup form. S-L-A-P that's a Reese's.

My husband and I are almost daily consumers of wonderful traditional Reese's Cups. Something has happened to the flavor. This flavor change isn't pleasant and has been in several packages from different stores. Has the recipe changed or is this just a temporary problem?

If your Reese cups get any smaller you can package them in the MiniReeses packaging ................

--------------------
What happened to the Reese snack size? I buy the Reese snack size bags regularly and the previous four bags I bought were terrible, no where near their usual delicious taste. Since these were so bad I reluctantly bought some from another store and they tasted great. What happened? My rating on those four bags is poor. I would not recommend Reese on those four bags.
--------------------
I recently splurge and got a 12 pack. I figured I would have a yummy treat over the next few days and share with my son. When I opened the first one I noticed it was markedly smaller than I was used to. Disappointing but not a deterrent. Then I popped it in my mouth and noticed an unpleasant test. I thought it was a fluke so I ate a second. Nope. Maybe it was something on my hands. So fast forward a few days and I walked my hands so I could make sure nothing messes up my treat. But that unpleasant taste was still there. That'sa deal breaker for me. I don't care that they make me fat if they taste good. But these did not. Guess it will be good for my waist line!
--------------------
I bought a 35.6 oz bag of peanut butter cup miniatures and there is an unpleasant taste to them, is there a different oil or something in use in the recipe? It leaves a terrible after taste which ruins it for me. What a waste!

--------------------
I've stayed away from the thins and the ones with Reese's Pieces in the cups, because who wants to cut down on the Reese's goodness!?! The regulars are still a go to any time. I think Hershey's needs to admit they have perfected this item and STOP messing with it! It has lasted as long as it has for a reason. For me, your regular Kit Kat bars are the same way.....though I do wonder what a Reese's cup Kit Kat would taste like!!!
--------------------
There is no better candy than a Reese's peanut butter cup! But, it is so disappointing to open the package and find your piece of candy has shrunk to half the size it used to be. So disappointing!!!
--------------------
The texture has changed and they taste gross. I dont know what ingredients the company has changed but the reeses cups taste horrible. Very poor quality lately

The changes made in how the chocolate and peanut butter are combined makes Reese's peanut butter cups UNACCEPTABLE! They no longer taste, or feel the same. You also have decreased their size. I'M NO LONGER CONSUMING THEM, YOU CAN KEEP THEM! What a shame when foolish corporate men get not so bright ideas. YOU RUINED THEM!!!

My wife two sons and myself love Reese's peanut butter cups more then any other treat we have movie nights almost every night and it's something we always try and keep handy nothing better
--------------------
I don't know how anyone could leave a bad review because Reese's are amazing!!!! I absolutely love Reese's!!!! :) My fianc√© and I always fight over Reese's. I usually have candy at my house for guests and Reese's are always the first candy to be all ate up by guests. Reese's is always the most requested candy or treat people want me to buy. A couple of days ago I had bought a bag of Reese's eggs. Woke up the next morning and the whole bag was eaten by my fianc√© and his brother. I was genuinely upset that all the Reese's Peanut Butter eggs had been eaten up so my fianc√© gave me more money to go out and get another bag of Reese's Easter Eggs. Lol I don't play when it comes to my Reese's! Reese's Peanut Butter Cups has always been my favorite!!!!

Opened the package today and these are the driest inside of the peanut butter I've ever seen. The peanut butter was crumbling off and tasted terrible.
--------------------
It's the perfect ratio of peanut butter to chocolate. I crave these more than any other chocolate, any other candy. It's to the point my man questions if I love these more than him some days.

Reese's peanut butter cups are a fun and delicious treat. I love these individually wrapped cups that are easy to put in a lunch bag or snack on at home. I grew up with Reese's peanut butter cups, they are my mom's favorite, and still enjoy them as an adult and share them with my own family. These cups have the perfect balance of chocolate and peanut butter. I would recommend these to my friends and family.
--------------------
I was so happy when I received The Peanut Butter Cups bc not only are they my absolute favorite I felt like it was Christmas when I received these in the mail. I've always preferd the Peanut Butter Cups over the Regular Reese's cups bc it was just enough Peanut Butter and Chocolate.
--------------------
Chocolate and peanut butter, the best combination! Individually wrapped so you don't have to eat them all at once, but they probably won't last long if you share with friends. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to satisfy their sweet tooth.
--------------------
Who doeant love peanut butter cups?? I so as well S my children, they are an amazing snack as well as a treat!!!
--------------------
The peanut butter cups were delicious! A big bag of heaven for sure. I am a huge chocolate person, and nothing beats having one or five peanut butter cups! They got it right mixing chocolate with peanut butter! Hands down one of my all time favorite that never gets old!
--------------------
These Peanut Butter Cups were delicious. They were enjoyed by the whole family. They had the right amount of chocolate and peanut butter.
--------------------
These are the very best! Such a great little satisfying snack!
--------------------
Great snacks for any family
--------------------
Who doesnt love chocolate!!!! it was soo yummy creamy and delicious
--------------------
great as always
--------------------
This is my all time favorite treat. Even my son loves these and he is not a fan of peanut butter. This will always be a staple in my candy jar.
--------------------
Loved the peanut butter cups they were so good . Milk chocolate with peanut butter filled ! My family and I enjoyed them so much!! Thanks
--------------------
These are great compared to other peanut butter cups I've tried. Sweet and not too dry.
--------------------
Always great! A classic favorite with a good balance between the peanut butter and chocolate.
--------------------
They are a great snack to take to work.
--------------------
Though personally I prefer the minis I will never turn down a reeces peanut butter cup. Let me say I am not a fan of any other peanut butter chocolate mixture, not in ice cream, shakes or anything just the cup. I had to share these mouth watering tasty treats with the kids because they saw.me.open the box lol. They were sent in exchange.for.an honest review and we.will definitely purchase in the future

I love peanut butter cups. There are so tasty. My whole family eats these up all the time. The bag is huge, but we love them so much we eat a bag a week
--------------------
The peanut butter cups were a great texture and consistency of peanut butter and chocolate. Perfect snack size as well. Great taste
--------------------
This was epic. I love Peanut Butter Cups. The package was nice and secure and I was so excited when I received and opened it. They arrived retaining their shape and more importantly their taste. They were finished faster than I thought they would be. The size is great for sharing and for myself. These were delicious
--------------------
Love love love this product...perfect size snack to grab. The bag is a perfect size to share with friends.
--------------------
Reese's Peanut Butter cups are my absolute favorite candy! The perfect sweet treat with a savory peanut butter inside! They are always exactly what I need to satisfy my craving for sweets. This size is perfect for a sweet treat any time of day!
--------------------
Still my favorite since I was a kid now I pack them in my kids Lunch. So good we all enjoy them
--------------------
You can never. go wrong with Reeces mini cups! They have the perfect ratio of chocolate to peanut butter and are always delicious!
--------------------
This is my go to treat, anytime I am looking for chocolate and peanut butter I always look for reese's . I would definitely recommend this.
--------------------
Best M&M bar ever! The crispies and minis make this so much better than a regular chocolate bar.
--------------------
So delicious. One of my top favorite candy bars!! It's extra good if you leave it in the refrigerator and eat it cold
--------------------
I am happy that M&M brought back the rice chocolates. Its still not as easy to find as it was years ago but it was one of my favorite M&Ms. I was sad to find out it no longer sold in America back then but when I went to Europe I was ecstatic to see it was still sold somewhere!
--------------------
This is the best candy bar I‚Äôve had in years! I wasn‚Äôt expecting the chocolate to taste good, but it‚Äôs SO good! And just the right amount of crisp! I hope this doesn‚Äôt get discontinued!
--------------------
I am addicted to these bars. The absolute best tasting chocolate paired with little rice crisps and mini m&ms. I love eating this bar with a small piece of granola as an after dinner snack.
--------------------
Yummy !! My sister and I shared it cause it was so big and we couldnt finish it so I would recommend for a group of people
--------------------
I love M&Ms and thought it cant get any better, right? Wrong they add more chocolate! I love chocolate more than the next person. These are definitely worth the buy!
--------------------
Not a huge fan of the rice crispy one. I prefer the almond one, thats the best. But, the chocolate itself, its so melt in your mouth!
--------------------
My favorite chocolate bar! So good! The chocolate is on point! Has a great flavor and the crispy just give you that enjoyable crunch. I love the sections in the bar but I could eat the whole thing to myself! If you havent already you need to try these!
--------------------
I remember when these came out! Theyre one of my new favorites! Next to regular and peanut M&Ms
--------------------
I love M&M minis and I also love chocolate bars, so this is a fantastic combination! when I am craving chocolate, I usually crave M&M's or Hershey bars. M&M's are really good if you put them in the freezer before enjoying them! You'll thank me for that tip later!
--------------------
I love this stuff. Its great and I really enjoy it so much. I would definitely purchase this product again in the future.
--------------------
I love m&ms its my favorite brand in the world I love and I would eat this everyday if I could. I prefer the tradicional but this is also great
--------------------
These bars are so amazing there actually one of my favorite candies out there kid friendly very good value for the price
--------------------
Great tasting chocolate. Similar to a crunch bar, but better. The added mini m and ms make it.
--------------------
Ong!!!!! This is my 2 favorite candies rolled into one. This is sooooo yummy. I have to have this in my house at all times. I love every bite. The crispiness and the special suprise of the mini m&ms. The chocolate is so smooth it melts in your mouth. So yummy!!!!
--------------------
I liked these ok. Id much rather prefer just the m&m minis by themselves and not in a bar. The chocolate was kinda meh, which was disappointing.
--------------------
I was surprised by these m&ms not my favorite but not bad either. I don't know if I would buy them again, actually I haven't seen them on shelves in awhile but they were not my thing. They were just an over prices chocolate krispy bag of color chocolate pebbles.
--------------------
These are my new favorites from m&ms. They are easy to get to & they are very good and sweet.
--------------------
This is a good candy chocolate candy to eat love the taste and packaging this has to be more of a fancy candy to be eatting due to the package it has a smooth chocolate taste and you get a nutty piece as a surprise and the middle love this nice candy invention also has a rich peanut butter flavor to it
--------------------
What a dwight this chocolate because it has the M&M and the Rice Crispy un a single bar this class is my favorite because one of my favorite chocolate is the M&M , I love chocolate
--------------------
Ehhh. The chocolate taste kind of cheap. This a was my first time buying the bar. If the chocolate had a richer tasted Id like it more.
--------------------
This is really crunchy and taste really nice. I dont eat this too often but I do buy this every now and then. No improvements needed. This candy bar is really cheap so dont worry. I would definitely recommend this to others!

These chocolate bars are SO GOOD!!! I seriously just want to eat the entire thing at once and have to restrain myself. The chocolate itself is really rich and creamy without being TOO sweet. And the crispies and mini m&ms inside give it the perfect texture.
--------------------
Similar to the crunch bar but with a m&m twist. The chocolate melts in your mouth and has a good amount of crispies and mini m&ms per bite
--------------------
This was like a crunch bar got mixed with m&m mini's and it was a combination i didn't know I needed! I thought that this was a clever use of the candy to make it into another candy bar type. This is delicious and if you like crunch bars and m&m's then try this!
--------------------
i grab 10 bars everytime i see them at the store. I love the taste of this chocolate bar. It is so sweet and crunchy. I would like to see these being sold in packs.
--------------------
The m&m chocolate bar is more indulgent than dove. I dont know hownor why bit their chocolate tastes like its gourmet. No joke. I think the chocolate bar is better than the m&ms itself. Great smoothness as well.
--------------------
I love these m and m candy bars. It's the perfect amount of chocolate and m and m. I love the taste and crispness.
--------------------
I love this candy because not only is the chocolate smooth but it also has that crispy taste too
--------------------
When i saw this on the tv being advertised i couldnt wait to try it cays ei love m&ms
--------------------
I can only find these bad boys a couple times a year, usually around Easter. They're my favorite of the m&m kinds.
--------------------
Im very into chocolate and I love this one. Not only because of the perfect flavor of milk chocolate, but also the crunchy of the crispy rice. It is not expensive and very sweet. It is not any close to dark chocolate, I love it
--------------------
These taste great. Love you mama M&Ms inside. And the chocolate is good. This is a great candy.
--------------------
I love this candy bar! My absolute favorite!!!!!!
--------------------
This tastes so incredibly amazing, my only complaint would be that it‚Äôs a little expensive for a candy bar.
--------------------
Crunchy and very delicious. The m&ms exposed on the top are nice. Unfortunately this one is hard to find often in stores. When I do see them I purchase several.
--------------------
This product is ok, there is just something about it thats not right. I feel that M&Ms dont belong in a chocolate bar. And if someone gave it to me I would totally eat it I just wouldnt go out and spend my money on it.
--------------------
Yeeesssss! Like rice crispy chocolatee... it's goood. Price is acceptable. I like a good melty crunch.
--------------------
Sooooo very good!! When you fell like you just want to bite on a chocolate bar, with m&ms stuck in it
--------------------
Soooooo good. Very filling so I will just take a small piece when I am craving something sweet. Great to have on the go.
--------------------
Household favorite! Anywhere we go and they have it we always get it! It take me and my boyfriend a while to finish it because of the amount but its great.
--------------------
When I first saw these I had to try it and I loved it! The chocolate just melts in your mouth I highly recommend if you are a chocolate lover!
--------------------
Such a yummy treat. Its like a crunch bar ate some Eminems also is very affordable
--------------------
It is a very good idea to make mini version because you can bring it in your backpack and eat it wherever you want, they are delicious and I eat it at the weekends also my family loves them because it has a delicious flavor
--------------------
This taste amazing and it being mini just makes it much better for me and the packaging of it is amazing and it is one of the best chocolate bars out there.
--------------------
I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the M&M bars of tried, but I have to say the crispy is one of my favorite. Its almost a bigger crunch bar with just a little more chocolate and crunch!
--------------------
My favorite chocolate so far since it came out. I love it so much I buy around 4 when I got to the store
--------------------
super good candy , one of my favorites , so many different types , peanut? peanut butter? chocolate? u name it , its super affordable too!
--------------------
These are addicting! Creamy, smooth, delicious chocolate and a perfect amount of crispy and sweet little minis. You cant eat just a piece. Delicious!
--------------------
Just had this for the first time the other day and I'm OBSESSED! The chocolate is smooth and different from typical M&M's. The minis have always been better to me than regular M&M's too. They add an extra crunch to the bar. I've recommended this to friends. I prefer this over DOVE at this point.
--------------------
I love love love those so much. Im not a big m&m fan, but as a chocolate bar, it is great.
--------------------
This is really yummy! It has little m&ms in it and some crunchy pieces! Really good!
--------------------
I absolutely loved these! They give you the creaminess of a chocolate bar, but with the twist of having texture with the crisps and minis. I haven't seen them in stores in a while though which makes me sad. I might try to find some online that I can hopefully buy.
--------------------
These new M&M chocolate bars are fantastic. The chocolate tastes just like an m&m but melted into a bar plus actual pieces of m&m inside the bar. They add things like rice crisp or almonds and other varietys in these bars. So tasty.
--------------------
I love love love M&M's crispy and minis milk chocolate candy bar. Is one of my favorite chocolates. It can be a little bit pricey though. I just can improve the price of the bars, but in general is very tasty and worthy to buy again
--------------------
This is my fiancs favorite! I cant find it everywhere but when I do we stock up! For me they are to sweet.
--------------------
M&Ms was already everyones favorite but now they came out with a candy bar and I am speechless. After trying them, all flavors ofc, I must say they outdid themselves. Spicing things up and changing an all time loving product to a fresher new idea. Highly recommend the almond one!
--------------------
Excellent candy bar. It is large, so sharing size for sure. I really like the crispy pieces, which offer a different texture in the bar. The chocolate has a great taste. Definitely a new favorite.
--------------------
I love anything with crispy chocolate just like Crunch. I can eat this in 2 sitting, I say 2 because thats lunch and night. Good chocolate flavor. Had them since I was a lid with the peanut m&ms
--------------------
Its just chocolate put inside a bigger chocolate. The candy shells inside the bar dont really add anything.
--------------------
Its really good and I love that theyre coming up with new but amazing products all the time
--------------------
These candy bars are surprisingly good! I like the quality of chocolate. Its pretty smooth milk chocolate.
--------------------
These are my FAVORITE candy bar! I'm so glad they came out with these, because you never realized what you were missing! I love the texture of the mini m&ms with the smooth & creamy chocolate bar. It gives it that perfect slight crunch. The chocolate is so smooth it melts in your mouth. I think this bar is reasonably priced! Give it a try!
--------------------
I love all the products and for me they are the most delicious types of confetti that exist! They have different flavors and the most fun delicious and colorful chocolates! I love it !
--------------------
I didnt think I would enjoy this but I got it in my Christmas stocking and I loved it! But I only liked the crispy version with the minis, the regular milk chocolate one is just too plain. I will definitely buy in the future.
--------------------
Very delicious I love m&m's I love to make cookies with these delicious chocolates the taste of Hershey's chocolate is so amazingly delicious
--------------------
Very good candy bar. I dont eat these very often but they are wonderful, it is quite a bit of chocolate though.
--------------------
I went into this with low expectations. I actually never found it appealing or felt a need to try this. I figured if I wanted M&Ms I would just buy the regular ones. Not a chocolate bar version. But I love this! Its so addicting. I like the little crunch in every bite and the taste of the candy and the milk chocolate from the bar! Very good!
--------------------
If I'm desperate for a sweet snack, I won't mind picking this up. If you can get past the stale middle ground of the crunch, you might enjoy it. The crispy aspect of this is nothing close to what you'd expect for a "crispy" snack. The flavor isn't too bad.
--------------------
This are my absolute favorite because I don't have to decide on normal m&Ms and a chocolate bar I get both in the same bite.
--------------------
Not the best candy bar but it's not the worst. The chocolate kind of overpowers the actual m&M's so it really just tastes like a random chocolate bar Despite having the m&M's in it it really just tastes basic. Nothing to really rave about
--------------------
Decent chocolate bar! I have always loved crispy types of chocolate and the addition of m & m's makes this even better. Recommend for anyone who likes both crispy chocolate and m & m's. Bars are also cut in squares to easily break.
--------------------
This is like a crunch bar but way better. The mini m&ms are perfectly spaced out, and the chocolate is not bitter or overly sweet. Easily a favourite.
--------------------
I was hesitant when they started coming out with these chocolate bars but out of all of them, this one is my favourite because it adds a crunch to it
--------------------
M&ms crispy milk chocolate bar is good for the value. Has a nice creamy milk chocolate taste. Its like eating a bunch of m&ms but in a bar form.
--------------------
I love M&Ms. The crispy mini milk chocolate candy bar is a delightful treat. Its very light.
--------------------
These are extremely good I love the little m&m inside the chocolate and it affordable . I dont have anything to complain about these
--------------------
Ahhh ya girl loves m&ms. Especially mini m&ms (they just hit different, anyone know why?!) this candy bar is soooo good crushed up on top of vanilla ice cream. Life changing hack for the quarantine
--------------------
Im a big chocolate person. The more the merrier so when I seen there were m&ms inside of a chocolate bar, say no more in my cart you go! Its rich, crunchy, and delicious!
--------------------
These are new in my supermarket and being obsessed with chocolate I had to sample one lol. Im a fussy chocolate eater, preferring more creamy rich European brands, but this was really tasty. It reminded me of a creamier Nestl Crunch Bar...but the chocolate was nicer. It wasnt overly expensive and there were other variations available
--------------------
I love the m&ms minis they are so good and tasty. I have always loved them my entire life
--------------------
M&m is always right. Products are little too sweet though. This product is the mixture of crisp and regular m&m. I really like the unique but classic taste
--------------------
Delicious! Chocolate bar with mini M&Ms inside. What more could you want? Definitely a must buy!
--------------------
These are good i like how crispy they are so that you just can't have one you have to have a lot of chocolate and the more you eat they taste better so you can share with a friend could enjoy them too.
--------------------
I recently tried these chocolate bars with m&ms and found them to be excellent. The milk chocolate is really good quality and I like the crispness of the m&ms minis. Id buy this again and recommend this to others!
--------------------
I love these candys thier so good I can litterly eat them all my self thats how dang good they are
--------------------
M&M is a great brand that smell good. The taste you can feel wonderful moment . M&M is fantastic fir my brain
--------------------
Ohhh, I have found this at the superstore, and it was calling my name, it's so good, the crunch from the rice crisps is an amazing add
--------------------
My favourite chocolate bar on this earth. I love the taste and the m&m and little crisps inside. Heaven in your mouth. Nothing in the world is better. This is my guilty pleasure and I will eat the whole thing.
--------------------
Holy Hanna this is hands down the BEST chocolate bar I've had in all my life! Like I'm obsessed!! It's way larger than a regular bar, so it does cost a bit more, but it's totally worth it!! There's a few different types, like milk chocolate, mint, milk chocolate & crisp rice (which is my personal fave!!) I buy these regularly, and would highly recommend to anyone with a sweet tooth who loves chocolate!
--------------------
MY FAVORITE CANDY BAR! Sooo good and soo addicting! It is so hard not to eat the whole candy bar! The M&Ms crispy always seems to be sold out so it's always hard to find these. The crispy is the best and it just melts in your mouth! Best M&M creation so far! I always look for these in the store and they're also not badly priced either. Definitely try these if you haven't.
--------------------
Just when I thought m&m's couldn't get any better they come out with these candy bars!! So easy to eat and so delicious. Great value very affordable. I recommend this for all ages as it is the perfect candy bar out there.
--------------------
I have been wanting to try these since they came out so I finally bought it it tastes soo good
--------------------
This new M&M chocolate bar is so delicious. I love the little crispy and m&m pieces in the chocolate. It is a very unique chocolate bar. Also I really like the packaging. The price on the high side but worth it for a snack once in a while.
--------------------
I found a piece of hair in my chocolate. This is disappointing since I sincerely enjoy Mars chocolates.
--------------------
I LOVE THIS CHOCOLATE BAR. this is a mix between a crunch bar and my favorite mini m&ms. The chocolate is so sweet and it tastes so good. I like the texture and it melts in my mouth. Great value for great bar.
--------------------
This is dangerous! I might eat the whole bar. A perfect blend of creamy and crispy! The crisps and mini m&ms are not overwhelming. Only downside it that it's 150 cal for a QUARTER of the bar!
--------------------
Wow! So impressed! Chocolate candy bar with rice crispies and mini M&M's. Sounds basic right? But the chocolate is so rich and creamy...by far one of the creamiest chocolate bars around. Highly recommend. So much better than other crispy bars. [product:mms-crispy-minis-milk-chocolate-candy-bar-38-ounce-bar-pack-of-4]
--------------------
Sooooo good!! Chocolate is really high quality.
