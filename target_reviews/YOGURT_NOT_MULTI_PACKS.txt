My kids love them! But some times they are bored about the same flavors and then they choose lala smothies. I think danimals need more flavors like mango or coconut. Other wise excellent !
--------------------
The yogurts are great, my kids love them, but this says it’s a 12 pack in the title but you only get 8! So is the price wrong too or just the title? I did order pickup so was not aware until I got home to put them away
--------------------
My kids love them￼. They always said this kid￼
--------------------
I dip apple slices in this flavor! It is just like a caramel apple without the guilt! I hope this flavor is not just seasonal! I’m hooked.
--------------------
Love Light and Fit!!! Awesome flavors! Great any time of the day.
--------------------
I love the Light & Fit yogurts and I always look forward to fall/winter time because they come out with seasonal flavors! This one is so good!! It’s an absolute must, it’s so good when it’s out in the freezer too just for a little, kind of tastes like ice cream!
--------------------
i’m 22 and these are my favorite snacks
--------------------
Great idea! Please make a starch free, stevia sweetened version!
--------------------
My kids love the taste.
--------------------
I’m a big fan of fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt and black cherries. This combination has just the right amount in creamy, protein rich, Greek yogurt. It’s a great replacement for milk with cereal (something that holds a crunch like mini wheats) and provides a delicious and satiating start to my day. I can’t keep enough in the house!
--------------------
I was a loyal Simply Balanced greek yogurt fan, until that was discontinued (thanks a lot). I moved on, though, with Oikos greek yogurt (the regular stuff -- not the "zero" variety with fake sugar). But mysteriously, for the past two weeks, the Oikos regular greek yogurt has gone missing, and after a week without yogurt, I was desperate enough to venture into unknown territory and try something new: Chobani. So disappointing. I had already torn off the cardboard housing around the 4-pack so I couldn't return it, but the cherry flavor tasted like tangy cough syrup. The yogurt was twangy and curdle-y, not smooth and balanced like the Oikos. I cho-cho-choked down my Chobani and felt very sad afterward. Not sure it is listed in the ingredients (sadness) but would not be surprised.
--------------------
I like this brand, but this flavor missed the Mark for me.
--------------------
This is the best low calorie yogurt on the shelf — it doesn’t taste bitter and the flavor is excellent. If you are a WW user, these yogurt cups are just 2 points, so they are a must have for breakfast, snacks, and deserts.
--------------------
14 grams of protein and only 80 calories. Yogurt cups have a little extra room at the top for you to add additional toppings of your choice. The strawberry cheesecake is pretty tasty without being overly sweet/heavy tasting.
--------------------
My daughter loves this yogurt. I love that the sugar content is lower than most of the other kids yogurt options and there’s no artificial flavors or sweeteners.
--------------------
These are delicious! I definitely recommend buying them for your kids.
--------------------
Obviously not the priciest/most quality yogurt out there. But love the flavor and consistency especially given the low sugar content!! Great bang for the buck in terms of flavor and nutrition
--------------------
Tastes just like fruit punch and is also nutritious! My kids love it!!!
--------------------
The best flavor of yogurt ever!
--------------------
Just as good as danimals!
--------------------
Yogurts are a tricky product when it comes to kids. I feel like most are packed with sugar and with Stonyfield I feel thats not the case. I feel comfortable feeding this yogurt to my toddler, and she loves it!
--------------------
This is great for growing kids. Both of my girls love this yogurt and will ask for seconds!
--------------------
My son loves this brand. I love that it is good for him! He asks daily for yogurt! The price is reasonable as well.
--------------------
I usually give this yogurt to my youngest. It has excellent rattle and is a great way for my little one to get the dairy that he needs in his diet.
--------------------
Great tasting yogurt, flavor is incredible. . Cant go wrong with the best one around. Absolutely delicious
--------------------
My kid would eat these 3 times a day if I let him. They actually taste like yogurt with strawberries. It is not overly sweet, compared to the other brands of kids yogurt on the market. I also like the kid sized packaging and the fact that the package comes with 2 flavors.
--------------------
The best yogurt for kids! Healthy, perfect flavor, and the perfect size. My little guy has one for breakfast every morning. We still always choose Stonyfield over other competitors! The strawberry blueberry pack is a go to in our house!
--------------------
Want to like these but they are full of added sugar. I dont understand why yogurt companies cant sweeten with real fruit, especially for kids!
--------------------
Love that it is organic and low in sugar for my baby and honestly, I love it, too! You cant get yogurt for adults this low in sugar and without the nasty fake sugars and additives!
--------------------
I am an adult and these are still my favorite yogurts. My favorite is peach/pear but I love all of them. These taste like no other yogurt I have tried and are also organic!
--------------------
It is a very good product, you can buy it whenever and wherever you want, you will not regret it and it will be a very good purchase, I hope the product works well for you, I love it.
--------------------
This is a go to for a higher fat, lower sugar yogurt for my kid that she still likes. She likes every flavor.
--------------------
These are great I have 6 kids and feeding them in the go is a priority its also great to know that you are giving them something healthy and not junk food
--------------------
Love to buy stoneyfield yogurt for my daughter. She devours them as fast as I can feed it to her. Definitely a go to breakfast in my house.
--------------------
I started this yogurt with my 1 year old and she loved it. She cant stop eating . kids always love berry flavors .
--------------------
My children love the whole milk yogurt over the Greek style kids yogurts that are popular. I like that this version is organic and that the milk does not have hormones. The taste is mild and not overpowering to kids.
--------------------
My children are addicted to stonyfield yogurt and this is their favorite pack. If allowed my three year old would eat them all in one day! I love that I can trust the ingredients and that they still taste great
--------------------
Great yogurt low sugar taste great and organic my son loves these but they are a little pricey
--------------------
Cant stop eating it - my kids love it and eat it like ice cream. Love it and love the simplicity.
--------------------
My kids love these. The flavor is great and the packaging is cute. The consistency is just a little too thick.
--------------------
I just bought these for my toddler a couple of weeks ago. They are pretty affordable and she seems to enjoy them. Its a plus if I freeze them into yogurt pops.
--------------------
Both of my kids, 9 months and 2 years old, love this yogurt. The texture is great and so is the taste. Its not loaded with sugar either!
--------------------
Best out of all yougurts, it is really good . For kids and for adults ) but I gues price could be less
--------------------
Stonefield yogurt is not just great because its organic, it is super smooth and tastes great. The little cups are just the right size for little ones. Mine love them.

I get this for my daughter every week and she loves it, eats it every morning for breakfast!
--------------------
This is the most convenient product for a baby. The flavors are delicious and work perfectly with fruit!
--------------------
My kids love this yogurt! We buy it every week! I trust this brand and the quality of this product!
--------------------
Best yogurt! Perfect to@eat with granola. Non fat, healthy and I eat it for snacks in the middle of the day. The flavor is amazing and not so sweet! Definitely one@of the brands Ill@never stop buying.
--------------------
My daughter enjoys the stonyfield organic blueberry and strawberry yogurt. I feel due to it being whole milk it seems thick but they doesnt seem to bother her. The cups are small enough for a good snack
--------------------
hello it is a good product I really like it and I would like to continue trying it and be part of your team
--------------------
These are my sons favorite yogurts to eat since he was a toddler. He is now older but still enjoys to eat these. I love the fact that they are low in sugar in comparison to other brands. And I love that they are organic.
--------------------
These are my daughters favorite yogurt cups. She will not eat any other kind. Im glad these are lower in sugar than the other brands not to mention being organic. Weekly staple in our house.

--------------------
My daughter loves this yogurt! She asks for a cup almost every day! I steal hers from time to time as well because it tastes so good. Definitely recommend!
--------------------
My kids love it B's yogurt packs! I actually like them myself too. I do wish there was a little bit more in a pack for how expensive they are. However the ingredients are a little healthier than most kids yogurt so I'll pay a little bit more for that.
--------------------
My toddler loves it! I like that it's organic and a healthy option. There is a great variety of flavors as well.
--------------------
I found these have too much sugar and the taste is artificial. Not the best choice for kids.
--------------------
I love this brand for my Little's. It's organic which is awesome and it's low in sugar which is a plus. My kids go crazy for it!
--------------------
My four year old eats yogurt on a daily basis. As a Mom I love that Stonyfield YoKids offers organic ingredients I can trust. As a kid, my daughter loves the great taste!
--------------------
Both of my daughters enjoy this yogurt. The flavor is good and the yogurt is smooth. They like the label because it is kid friendly and they know it is for them. I prefer this brand over other brands in children's yogurt because it's organic and the texture.
--------------------
These are my 5 year olds favorite yogurts. I love being able to give him a less sugar yogurt before he goes to school in the morning.
--------------------
Hi son loves this yogurt and that makes me happy because it is also a healthy alternative to traditional yogurts. It has a very low sugar content. And it taste great as well. I will continue to buy this product
--------------------
Best ever snack size specially for kids! it's so important to add yogurt as part of food triangle in kids meal and you know how hard it so convince them to eat healthy food. This is the best tasting yogurt, organic and just super! my kids just love it!
--------------------
My kids love these yogurts! In the summer we stick popsicle stickers through the seal and freeze them. They make great cold, healthy snack on a hot day and the flavor is amazing! These are a must have in our home!
--------------------
Kids love this yogurt! Doesn't have a weird taste ! Great for snack anytime !! Love the natural fruit taste !!
--------------------
Love this organic yogurt for my little. Cups are easy for her to scoop and she loves the independence of eating it herself.
--------------------
Our kids love this yogurt! Our son has texture issues and won't eat yogurt if it has big chunks of fruit in it. This is perfect for him!
--------------------
Great yogurt, good taste, lots of healthy probiotics and only yogurt we buy weekly. The price is okay, like the consistency of the yogurt it's smooth and thick. Only wish they made more flavors.
--------------------
These are a little pricey but my daughter absolutely loves them!! Super healthy for her digestive track too.
--------------------
So so so good!!! My toddler loves these, and I love that they aren't packed with sugar - only high quality, organic ingredients. Great flavor - I sneak them from time to time because they are that good!
--------------------
My son loves these! They are the prefect size for small tummies. I have been buying these for several months now. The Blueberry and Strawberry pack is great because it has variety!
--------------------
These are so delicious. My son enjoys these and I also enjoy sneaking a bite or two.
--------------------
My daughter is a very very picky eater and absolutely loves the different flavors of stonyfield yogurts. She has been eating them since she was a baby. The one she loved the most then was the sweet potato one!
--------------------
I get this yogurt for my toddler. She likes it and I like the fact that it's organic. I wish there where more options when it came to flavors. We end up buying the same ones over and over again.
--------------------
Good flavor, would rather have whole milk than reduced or low-fat but good price and good quality.
--------------------
This pack works perfectly for my kids. One likes blueberry and one likes the strawberry. They love the flavors and it's a healthy snack. Great amount for the price.
--------------------
My daughter absolutely loves these! Much healthier than anything else I have found for her. Her doctor says it's very good for her. I have been buying it for 4 months now and I highly recommend that anyone with a LO tried it!
--------------------
I love these yogurts because they taste so so good and they're nice and thick if you don't stir it but then thin if you do so you can have both
--------------------
I have twin 8mo babies and we just introduced yogurt and they love it. Not many brands make yogurt for babies.
--------------------
My 14-month-old baby loves this yogurt. She eats one almost every day and as always upset when it is all gone. The ingredients our healthy and wholesome and I feel good about giving this food to my baby. I also like that is available at most groceries.

--------------------
My daughter loves these. She has one almost every day. We tried the tubes of yogurt out but she still prefers these.
--------------------
My toddler loves this yogurt! I wish they made a big tub of it. My son can eat two at one sitting because there isn't much in the container. I like that there isn't bad junk in it so he can eat as much as his heart desires!
--------------------
My favorite tasting yogurt by far. I dont care that its for kids its delicious and I love the texture. Definitely recommend the stonyfield brand of yogurt in general
--------------------
My son loves this yogurt brand. He is now 2 years old so we switched over to the kids rather than the baby. He asks daily for yogurt!!
--------------------
Love Stonyfield. The quality is amazing for the price and I always trust the product which is why I choose this brand for my children. It has great flavor and nothing artificial tasting. My boys love it!
--------------------
My son loves this yogurt. I feel good knowing what is in the food he is eating and trust Stoneyfield. Perfect blend of strawberry/banana. Doesnt taste like its full of artificial sweeteners. Would buy again.
--------------------
My son loves stoneyfield yogurt. This is no exception. Great price and great ingredients.
--------------------
These are perfect to have on hand for our toddler! I think theyre a great price for a great snack for him. Easy and delicious! I love that theyre whole milk as well. Better for him!
--------------------
The best yogurt for kids! Healthy, perfect flavor, and the perfect size. My little guy has one for breakfast every morning. We still always choose Stonyfield over other competitors! The strawberry banana pack is a go to in our house!
--------------------
MY kids love this. I buy it whenever I see it bc they are easy to use and they love the flavors. It's a great product and I'd recommend it to anyone
--------------------
My kids only yogurt they ever had. The best! It doesnt have unnecessary junk in ingredients and no gelatin. No need to mix , just open and start feeding.
--------------------
My kids dont like yogurt without any flovar.thats why this brand yogurts are favorite for my kids.they really loves strawberrys and bananas flavor.
--------------------
The whole family eats this brand. If my daughter isn’t feeling well or teething, she will still eat her Stoneyfield Whole Milk yogurt. She loves all the flavors!
--------------------
This is my kids favorite type of yogurt. I love the whole milk aspect, I love that its organic, and I love that it contains lower sugar than most other yogurts. Most of all I love that my kids love this yogurt. Theyve been eating it most of their lives (3 & 5yrs old) but they never get tired of it. Weve tried others but this is our go to!
--------------------
The first yogurt I ever gave my baby at 6 months old. Ever since then we havent turned back. The sugar content is one of the lowest ones of the yogurts.
--------------------
Baby LOVES his Yobaby. We cant give it to him fast enough. Its the very first thing he eats every morning, and this has been a routine since he began eating solid foods. I love it too, but theres usually no sharing when it comes to his yogurt.
--------------------
These are very creamy and tasty. Not very sweet which is great. My children love them !
--------------------
My son loves this yogurt. It's so smooth and creamy; I can almost convince him it's dessert. :) It's such a healthy, good protein start to his day.
--------------------
Great yogurt and with whole milk! Has the healthy fats kids brains need! It is a much healthier option than the yogurts full of sugar and dyes
--------------------
My toddler is a fan of stonyfield kids yogurt. We have friend different flavors, but the strawberry banana one is his favorite
--------------------
I always loved the kids yogurts, they all taste very good. These taste really really good and I love them. Would definitely recommend.
--------------------
My babies love these yogurts. I love them too because the leading brand is filled with preservatives and ingredients I cant pronounce. The yogurts are sometimes a bit pricey, but nothing is ever too good to feed my kids.
--------------------
My baby loves this. Its a good and healthy treat. Shes past the mushy food stage but still loves her yogurt. Even great as a frozen treat.
--------------------
My baby and older kids all like this yogurt. I like that it is organic and comes in a six pack. The 4 oz is a great serving size.
--------------------
So good going down. My grandchildren love these Strawberry Banana. They are rather pricey, can't afford them very often. It would be nice to have a more reasonable price, but I know, healthy food is expensive.
--------------------
My son loves all of the Stonyfield yogurt products. One of the few brands on the market where I love the whole foods ingredients lists and low added sugar content!
--------------------
This was the first yogurt i gave my son when he started eating dairy as a baby! He loved it as a baby and loves it now as a 4 year old! We buy Stonyfield all the time in our home! Highly recomended to start with when your baby can eat yogurt.
--------------------
My son really likes this yogurt. He is a picky eater to this is always stocked in my fridge. I can't get his to eat any other brand of kids organic yogurt(some other brands have yogurt marketed towards children but are packed with sugar and artificial flavoring so I refuse to purchase those).
--------------------
Love this flavor, it’s the only one they will eat. Prefers the whole milk version
--------------------
These yogurt cups are the perfect size for my almost 4 year old! He is able to finish a whole cup by himself at meals. I love how there is less sugar than other brands marketed to children and that it is made with whole milk making it a little more nutrient dense. My son prefers this yogurt to other brands and I feel better knowing it is a good snack choice for him.
--------------------
This yogurt is so good! My toddler LOVES it! Plus, its healthy! The flavors are perfect for toddlers and I know there arent any weird ingredients or lots of added sugar! Freezes well and makes great smoothies and homemade yogurt pops!!
--------------------
My kids flew through this pack of yogurt. Its their go to snack or they like to pair it with their cereal instead of milk
--------------------
My kids absolutely loves this yogurt. Eventhough we don't normally eat anything that's organic, they beg for it. Especially my 4 year old then my 2 year old comes around and asks for it too. I wouldn't change anything about it. Yes, I would recommend it to any family that likes organic foods.
--------------------
Kids enjoy them and they are healthy. Win win. I would recommend for picky eaters or just anyone!
--------------------
My little sister loved these when she was young, and now my daughter l loved them as well
--------------------
My toddler has a Stonyfield yogurt every morning with her Cheerios. She seems to like all the flavors equally. I feel good about giving her this high quality, whole milk yogurt.
--------------------

--------------------
Everyone in my house loves the flavor and creaminess of your whole milk yogurt. I feel good knowing its organic.
--------------------
Love this for my toddler! Whole milk and not too sweet, and portioned perfectly! Hard to find in Canada :(
--------------------
I have a 2 year old and a 3 year old and they both love stonyfield yogurt! They love the pouches or the cups, and they make a perfect healthy filling snack or side to a meal. We typically have these for breakfast, or throughout the day as a healthy snack option.
--------------------
This yogurt makes me feel better about the ingredients. Its basic and still tastes good.
--------------------
My 2 year old loves these! Its got pretty good ingredients and it doesnt taste artificial like some of the more popular yogurts.
--------------------
This yogurt has less sugar than the other yogurts geared toward children. Plus it also has live active cultures. My grandchildren love this yogurt.
--------------------
My son loves this. His pediatrician wanted us to introduce him to whole milk and said that we should give him yogurt. A year later he still loves eating this! My other kids started eating this as well because he enjoyed it so much.
--------------------
A great yogurt for the kids. Glad it's still whole milk, and they love the flavors. I trust stonyfield for my family.
--------------------
My son has been eating this yogurt since he was a year old. He loves it! It hasn't given him any bad reactions ever, his favorite is strawberry and banana.
--------------------
Added sugar! I used to get their versions of unsweetened yogurt, but they now add sugar to all their versions except plain. I can buy regular adult Whole milk yogurt in plain. My baby liked the sweet potato and carrot. My husband accidentally bought her the sweetened one, but I refused to feed it to her. She currently prefers healthy food and won’t even eat sweets. When her grandma tried giving her waffles, she made a face and asked for the fruit instead. I don’t see why we should teach our children to prefer sweetened foods. Sugar is not good for any of us. My pediatrician had recommended their brand BECAUSE they had unsweetened flavors. These were convenient since they were flavored and unsweetened. Now there is no reason to buy this brand. I am hoping that they will see this and bring back the unsweetened versions.
--------------------
These taste great, my kid loves them. Wish there were more flavor options but these are fine for now.
--------------------
My son 1 year old and I always buy that for him. It is really good ingredient and healthy!
--------------------
I'm not a fan of the consistency of yogurt in general but wanted to add some into my diet. I found stonyfield yo baby and yo toddler with Apple and blueberry and strawberry banana. This is the only yogurt I will eat. It's got a nice consistency and no fruit chunks. Also the serving is smaller than an adult yogurt and it's perfect for me to add into my daily diet with breakfast. They are a bit spendy.
--------------------
Started buying this when my boys were little, and I still buy it for them when they are big! They love the taste, and it's the perfect serving size!
--------------------
Our baby girl loves eating this. It has an awesome flavor, doesn't taste artificial, and it also kind of thick so it's also pretty mess-free for her to eat on her own. I like that it's not overly sweet so she's not taking in too much sugar, would definitely repurchase.
--------------------
I like that it is lower sugar and my 10 month old will eat them but I do not like them for myself at all. The flavor is fairly bland and they are somewhat pricey.
--------------------
My son is a huge fan of yogurt and he loves the variety of the Stonyfield ones. The strawberry banana flavor is a wonderful combo and he enjoys the creamy texture and the sweet taste.
--------------------
My son loves this snack and I feel good giving it to him. I also sneak one every once in a while. The live active probiotics work wonders on he and I. Definitely a repeat user for sure
--------------------
My toddler absolutely loves these yogurts. They are perfect for breakfast or snack time. It's her favorite type of yogurt.
--------------------
My son loves this yogurt. Its a good consistency so he can eat it without making a huge mess. And it has way less sugar than other brands of kids yogurt.
--------------------
This is the only yogurt my kids will eat and I always feel good giving it to them. I have fed them up baby when they were babies and now these. They love the flavor and the consistency. I would definitely recommend this yogurt to anyone.
--------------------
My son loved this yogurt. I also love the size of the containers and find that we do not waste much. They are worth the money! I wouldn't change much about this product if I could! I have purchased multiple times.
--------------------
My toddler loves this yogurt! It's portable and easy to serve if you're always on the go.
--------------------
This is my son's absolute favorite yogurt! If he could, he would eat them constantly! He goes into the fridge and gets them and runs right over to his chair to eat it! It is his favorite snack! It is definitely a healthy snack for a growing boy! I recommend these to any moms that have little ones!
--------------------
My baby is in love with these. He eats them like their ice cream, I love how guilt free it feels to feed your child this. It's a nutritious snack that also tastes great! I would highly suggest these to all parents.
--------------------
My son loves these sometimes has 2 at a time. Love that they are organic. It's a good feeling knowing he is devouring something that is also good for him and free of hormones and junk
--------------------
My granddaughter really enjoys this product and for the price, it is a great value. I always try to have some on hand for when she visits.
--------------------
All organic is very important in our household! I look for high quality ingredient and least processed! This is a great product for my kids to get in their dairy nutrients!
--------------------
Delicious and healthy for my growing toddler! Happy that it is organic and there are no hormones or additives! Perfect small portion size and a tasty treat ! I have purchased it multiple times. I would recommend to other parents looking for healthy snacks.
--------------------
My children really enjoy this, it's nice to be able to open it and just give it to them to eat. I feel like the taste and quality are better than other products. The value is there it may be a bit more expensive but it's better as well. There is nothing else I wld add.
--------------------
My two year old loves Stonyfield Strawberry Banana yogurt. The portion size is perfect for her, and the taste is phenomenal. She gets so excited every time I get it out of the frig. Highly recommended for picky eaters.
--------------------
My kids love this yogurt. Very low in sugar and has protein in it. Perfect snack or breakfast
--------------------
I love buying the organic yogurt for my toddler. I know this is one of the healthiest yogurts on the market for children. My toddler looks forward to having a yummy yogurt for breakfast every morning. I would recommend these yogurts to anyone!
--------------------
Loved these when my kids were small. Perfect size portions to go with a snack or side at lunch. Makes it easier for a learning toddler to independently eat
--------------------
Go to yogurt when my kids were younger and my toddler loves it. A little pricey but I know it's quality ingredients so it's worth it.
--------------------
I'm being using this since my little one was six months. He really like the flavores they offer plus it's organic;)
--------------------
I have a 14 month old daughter who eats this yogurt frequently for breakfast. We pretty much always have it in the fridge. She loves it and I feel good ability giving it to her. We also do the pouches frequently too.
--------------------
Kids love this yogurt. They eat it up as soon as it hits the fridge with no hesitation. I think yeh size of it is good because it's not too much and not too little. Perfect little snack for the kids during the day or with their lunch!
--------------------
My husband was going through a rough digestion period so he had to eat active live cultures and this was all we could find! He loved them and ate the pack so fast (I mean it is for babies lol) but he would love it if we could find larger sizes in our area.
--------------------
My kids enjoy the whole milk yogurt. I like it for the fat content. I'm anticipating the company to come out with a dairy free option.
--------------------
The first yogurt I introduced to both my kids at 6months. They loved it and I loved it because it wasn't so sweet.
--------------------
Looooove buying these for my daughter. She enjoys them for breakfast or a snack and she gets excited for them!
--------------------
The best yogurt for kiddos! My little ones loved it for just about any meal of the day and if they didn't finish it, I didn't mind having the rest. They still ask for it from time to time and they are 6.
--------------------
I chose to buy this product because it is a lower in sugar content alternative to traditional yogurts for my young son. I have been pleased with his reaction to this yogurt. I will be continuing to buy this product
--------------------
My kids love these! My only complaint is that I wish they had less sugar. But I love that they're organic and have less sugar that most brands. Kind of on the pricier side but that's to be expected with organic.
--------------------
This is my kids favorite yogurt. We have tried many brands and this is one that they will eat everyday. It's a great price, very affordable. We buy this each week from the store and sometimes we have to buy two because they eat them two times a day.
--------------------
Do you like Stonyfield organic whole milk yoghurt it is very hard to find in Canada when I would go to America I always buy in bulk my kids really like that
--------------------
Love this brand of yogurt taste so good is yummy and even my child eats it as a whole serving for breakfast
--------------------
I bought it for my toddler. She didn't like it and I ended eating them all. They are good.
--------------------
These are hit or miss with my toddler. Maybe it depends on the flavor. They are definitely priced well for a six pack, compared to other kids yogurts that are ridiculously expensive. I have bought them several time and will do so until my toddler decides she doesn't like them anymore.
--------------------
My toddler son likes it. It is creamy and quite sweet. To me it tastes bit artificial but my son seems okay with it so I buy it all the time for him. I wish it had more flavors.
--------------------
My daughter loves this yogurt! We always have it on hand for her! An automatic purchase every week!
--------------------
My daughter loves these yogurts. I like that she's getting whole milk dairy product. She asks for her yogurt every day. Nice a thick.
--------------------
My daughters favorite well one , she loves only Greek yogurt none of that sweet fruit yogurt. It's at a good price sometimes so we get stonyfield at the right price
--------------------
I'm not a toddler which you can hopefully surmise from my ability to type, but I buy this product for myself. The whole fat is so dreamy. I like the layer it forms on the top. Even the small serving size is just right!
--------------------
This yogurt is my sons favorite, he knows the packaging and gets excited when he sees it. It has a light flavor which is great for kids and it's organic! This is totally worth the buy and your kid will love it!
--------------------
My cousin loves these for when he goes to school. He loves strawberry banana and it's one of his favorite things to eat.
--------------------
I love this product for my kids because these are organic and are whole milk to give great nutrition to my kids. Our favorites comes in mixed fruit flavors. However even tough I love this I wish the come in many more flavors.
--------------------
Delicious snack! Every time I snack on these I wish I had another one!! Aaaah why are there only 6 in a pack
--------------------
My almost two year old loves this yogurt. It's the one thing we can always guarantee she will eat when we put it in front of her. It's just the right amount of yogurt in terms of serving size so it's a perfect snack or part of her lunch.
--------------------
These are so nice and convenient to pack in lunches. They are delicious and fill with great ingredients.
--------------------
Ok! My kids used to eat all the timw! I love the organic choices it gives me! Great flavors
--------------------
My kiddo loves these. She isn't a fan of very many types of yogurt but this one she loves. Sometimes plain, sometimes with a little granola tossed in, but she eats this for breakfast quite a bit. It's also great in smoothies
--------------------
My girls love this yogurt. They are always asking for any of the Stony Field organic yogurts.
--------------------
My kids love this brand. Perfect size for them. We also used the baby one and worked our way up to the toddler
--------------------
I can confirm this yogurt is full of bacteria. A delicious vanilla flavor that is both smooth and robust, I can't help but succ on the cup when the bulk is finished. 10/10 please make more.
--------------------
I love that this yogurt has low sugar content but still so tasty! I don’t feel guilty sharing this with my baby as it has a sweet subtle flavor without all the sugar. Just wish it was more affordable.
--------------------
Excellent. Very smooth. I have it for dessert
--------------------
My 1 year old son loves it, my family too. Taste so good. Recommended!!
--------------------
Amazing. Just tried it and it is delicious and the price is very fair considering it is high quality - love!
