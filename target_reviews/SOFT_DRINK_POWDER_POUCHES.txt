This is SERIOUSLY the best flavor crystal light has come up with. Please don’t discontinue this one!!
--------------------
This is one of my favorite flavors they have ever come up with. You can choose how much sugar￼￼ or sugar alternative to add to it to make it just the way you like.
--------------------
So good. Super fruity but not too sweet. Best if it’s cold. Super refreshing. Inexpensive.
--------------------
sorry i dont like it they all taste too too sweet i get very thirsty after drinking it you are better off with sugar than the sweetners they put in it
--------------------
Crystal light is a quick and easy way to drink water that you actually enjoy. Some ppl have a really hard time drinking water and need that push. You just dump the mix into your water and you have delicious tasting mixes at your fingertips
--------------------
I don’t drink juice often, but when I do want that little sweetness I often turn to this! It provides exactly what I need with low cal and it tastes great.
--------------------
This is very delicious! It is a lot better than I expected it to be. I love it a lot. The only down side is it kind of leaves your mouth dry.
--------------------
This stuff is SO GOOD. i love everything peach. i highly recommend this! it’s not bad for you either.
--------------------
What drives me crazy about this one, it’s that it only has 5 calories per serving! I add it to my water bottle and take it on the go. It’s so refreshing and goood! Definitely recommend it.
--------------------
This flavor is my favorite of the crystal light drinks. It has a nice peach flavor and I love that it is guilt free. I usually make a full pitcher to make sure that it isn’t too strong or too weak.
--------------------
my favorite low calorie way to enjoy iced tea in convenient to go packets. i keep some in my purse so water isn't cutting it I can add a pack!
--------------------
I like grabbing this tea packet whenever I’m in a rush and don’t have time to make tea. It’s so easy to make just throw this packet into a cold glass of water and voila! I would recommend to others as it is a great energy booster
--------------------
I love green tea and I love peach/mango flavored drinks so this was a perfect drink flavor for me. It’s easy to use too, all you do is open the package and pour it in a full water bottle, shake and your good to go! The peach and mango flavor are good, not too overpowering. It is a nice refreshing drink!
--------------------
These are great when you really want a sweet drink but don’t want to get caught in all the sugar and calories. I will say it has almost a little bit of film or left over residue in your mouth. Nothing terrible but it’s noticeable. Probably has something to do with the fake sweetener. Overall still really great substitute
--------------------
Crystal Light drinks are really good. When I buy them I run out after 3 days! The peach mango one has been my favorite by far.
--------------------
Obsessed with this! The perfect on the go drink mix to throw in a water bottle. It’s low calorie, great flavor, and doesn’t have an artificial taste.
--------------------
This tea is very good and refreshing. This tea has a lot of flavor, and not too sweet
--------------------
Amazing flavor super yummy and easy to mix with water at anytime you can use that while working
--------------------
One of my favorites is tea is great full of flavor not overwhelmed by the fruit flavoring very refreshing￼
--------------------
Tastes sooo good! It’s sweet but not overbearing. It contains a lot of aspartame however which kind of turns me off but it’s a great alternative to water every now and then! I would recommend because it’s cheap too
--------------------
Great mango peach tea on the go but worth the price about same prices other brands love the variety
--------------------
These are the best way to make sure you’re drinking enough water if you’re one of those people who don’t like the taste of plain water. They come in so many different flavors and easy to throw in a purse
--------------------
Crystal light has so many great flavors, but I like peach mango the most. Easy to prepare, great summer drink
--------------------
I have always loved crystal light! The sweet but not too sweet flavor it adds to water makes a great on the go drink!
--------------------
Love this flavor , lightens up the flavor and it absolutely delicious paired with breakfast
--------------------
I dont always love drinking plain water so adding some flavor without the calories is perfect! Not too sweet either. Just one packet in a water bottle and shake it up. Super easy and flavorful. Many different flavors.
--------------------
this is my favorite powdered drink on the market i always use them at work for a little pick@me up
--------------------
Overall this is not my favorite flavor of crystal light, but it’s not bad. It’s not like some of the other flavors that end up helping me drink more water because they taste so good.
--------------------
I drink this religiously. I love these little packets. So easy to just throw in and go and always tastes amazing!
--------------------
Perfect to take with you anywhere you go. Flavor is delicious. Its affordable. And easy to make in a hurry. Prefect for water bottles or glasses at home.
--------------------
I really enjoyed crystal light when I was younger, but now that I know more about artificial flavors it is not my favorite. I think it’s good for people who don’t love drinking water because it will help them consume more liquids if they only like flavored drinks.
--------------------
I prefer the mix without the caffeine -I'm not sure why, but these didn't taste as crisp as the regular orange flavor. They can also be quite a bit more expensive - this is a great way to help hydrate if you have troubles getting enough water during the day!
--------------------
Great product, really enjoy it and i do recommend it to every one, I feel everyone will like it as much as I do
--------------------
Absolutely my fave all you have to do is add water , already comes with great flavor . Great to give to kids so it reduces cavities cuz there some made with no sugar added they still think it’s the best juice ever [product:crystal-light-multiserve-fruit-punch-sugar-free-14]
--------------------
Very flavorful and the flavors and are very delicious! This one is definitely a family favorite that gets fought over all the time!
--------------------
I am not sure which flavor I like best but I don’t think I’ve ever had one that I disliked
--------------------
Crystal light is my favorite. You have got to try out their pink lemonade flavor and their cherry limeade flavor.
--------------------
Crystal Light is my go to when I'm craving something with flavor. Affordable and a great variety of flavors. My favorites are the packets sized for bottles of water. I keep them at work with me and it curbs the soda cravings.
--------------------
Fruit punch, is one of my favorite drinks to buy....o love crystal light but this flavor wins for me. Hands down..just the right sweet and flavor..thanks
--------------------
I love this mix! I use it to mix with my vodka. That way I’m staying hydrated, but also drinking something yummy! Perfect combo.
--------------------
This is my family’s go to drink. Make 2-3 gallons a week :) also mixing it with lemonade it good to
--------------------
I really like that its light and refreshing.. I cant drink carbonated drinks and get tired of just water all the time so, it's nice to have something light with actual flavor..
--------------------
I love taking these to the river on hot days makes an easy drink that everyone loves! I love the friuit punch
--------------------
Good flavor at a good price. I’ve used this several times. The family loves the flavor.
--------------------
I love the taste of This! Not too sweet. I work in a warehouse, so plenty of water is a must. I love flavoring it up and this is one of my go tos!
--------------------
I've used this stuff because my dad & uncle prefer sugar free drinks. This is good from what I remember. I'm not against sugar free things. I like crystal light. It tastes good.
--------------------
I've been buying Crystal Light for a few years now. My favorite flavors are raspberry ice tea and peach mango green tea. It lasts a while when I make it because it's too sweet so I dilute it.
--------------------
I love crystal light fruit punch. Being a pre-diabetic I look for products that are sugar free and taste great! I just discovered they make great ice pops for the summer, just freeze with a couple of strawberries and delicious frozen treat!
--------------------
Crystal Light is the best. It can be a little pricey but it’s worth every penny. I have tried a lot of the flavors the fruit punch and the peach tea is my favorites. Be careful when you first try it and don’t put too much mix in your water because you can make it too “strong”.
--------------------
Not toi sugary tasting but perfect especially with these hot days approaching. Easy to pour in an ice cold water bottle
--------------------
I think these are way too sweet. One little pouch is enough for like 2 or 3 bottles of water. Though ive seen people put a whole pouch in one. Im not that much of a sugary person thogh i prefer water.
--------------------
I love crystal light. Fruit punch is my favorite of all of them. I love that it is sugar free and so easy to make. Taste so good on a hot summer day.
--------------------
love this flavor, always drank it as a kid. and it’s light on the calories and easy for on the go
--------------------
These are so good. You just put a little bit of it in a glass and they taste really well. I enjoy drinking this while having meals at work.
--------------------
Fruit punch is the best in my opinion, I love the taste of it it’s like a healthy juice
--------------------
I have a serious addiction to Crystal light packets. The flavor is on point and very refreshing. It is great on a really hot day!
--------------------
I love Crystal Light! It makes getting all my daily water in much easier! And this flavor is so good!
--------------------
Love the favor of this drink and definitely is very health and doesn’t have all of the unadded sugar!
--------------------
It taste really good. I can't believe it's sugar free. I have a hard time drinking plan water. So I mix This in and it just makes me want more.
--------------------
I havent tried this drink but i love the lemonade so im sure this is just as good. With the lemonade all you have to do is add a packet to a bottled water and shake. So good and refreshing...really great when ice cold water is applied
--------------------
I love this stuff. My husband is a kool aid addict so I had to get him to cut back on the sugar. This has done the trick.
--------------------
I love this stuff! Especially in the Summer when we go to the lake! I enjoy the taste and the price!
--------------------
I love the crystal lights fruit punch. It’s very refreshing and has a good tastes for a low calorie drink. It has better flavor than other brands. I buy this regularly
--------------------
[product:crystal-light-raspberry-lemonade-drink-mix]! This is my favorite!!!! This is never to far from my reach. It is just the perfect mix of Raspberry and Lemonade! And I love that it I can just throw a pack or two in my purse grab some water and put the door I go!
--------------------
Like the Crystal Light Fruit Punch flavor almost as much as I like their raspberry ice flavor. The single serving packets are so easy to carry with you.
--------------------
My favorite crystal light drink mix is the raspberry lemonade but the fruit punch is definitely in my top picks. These help give water a new kick when you’re getting tired of the bland water flavor. I think it’s an awesome value and the flavor is amazing! I would recommend this product to anyone.
--------------------
Very tasty, and low calorie. Would recommend 10/10 to anyone. Also very affordable. Could use more flavors but have many to choose from.
--------------------
I love mixing in a pack of Crystal Light in my bottle waters because I drink tons of water. So it's great when i can mix in a little flavor besides lemon.
--------------------
The minute the weather gets warm I stock up on crystal light Lemon Ice Tea packets. Has the perfect amount of lemon and tea combo. Not as much as an Arnold Palmer. But enough where it refreshing on a hot day! Lets face it , you can only drink so much water and soda is bad for you and loaded with calories. I keep the packets everywhere.. My purse, beach bag, my truck, and even my makeup bag..!! Stores always have buy 2 specials and when they do I stock up.
--------------------
Love, love, love Crystal Light! While it can be one of the more expensive flavored brands I love how potent each packet is for a water bottle. Compared to other brands Crystal Light always pskcs the perfect punch for a water bottle!
--------------------
I personally love this product I always carry a couple packs with me anywhere I go I also give a packs of my kids when they're take lunch to school we always take bottles of water everywhere we go so when they're at school if they decide if they want a little something to drink sweet but it's also pretty good for them then they just add the little packets to their bottle of water shake up and drink
--------------------
I love this drink mix!! I started only drinking crystal light when I went on my diet to replace soda. I haven't had a problem cutting sodas out at all because of this. There are so many flavors to choose from and they all taste great. I am kissing weight but enjoying what I drink still. I will be keeping this around for a long time.
--------------------
Crystal Light is a good product and I'm glad I was able to get it at Target.
--------------------
This is the single best Crystal Light flavor ever. The single-serve containers are perfect for bringing with you on a run, so you can add them to your water bottle when you're absolutely tired of water but don't want the sugar of Gatorade. Probably drink one or two of these a day. At that rate I should probably just get the bigger size the picture size containers but the single-serve is just perfect. I hope Target carries these forever because they're so hard to find.
--------------------
I wish it came in the larger package as it once did. I like the flavor, but one package per bottle of water is a little too strong for me. I mix 3 packages to a half gallon pitcher of water.
--------------------
I just discovered this flavor, and it's a refreshing change. So delicious!
--------------------
This flavor is my favorite! Love it! I can seriously drink this everyday all day
--------------------
I have enjoyed your Crystal Light products for several years. However it seems you keep getting rid of the best flavors and this usually happens when a new "Flavored Tea" comes out. Not all people are tea lovers and we liked these flavors. Flavors include: Lemon Lime, the green one from years ago; Ruby Red Grapefruit, another old flavor; Newer flavors include: Cherry Limeade; and Cherry Pomegranate. Who chooses which flavors get deleted and which get saved. I wish these old flavors could come back and if you must get rid of some how about Fruit Punch and Grape.
--------------------
Opened a brand new tube of powdered drink mix and all the packets were rock hard. Best by date of 10May2020.
--------------------
I love this! But with all of the healthy, natural sweetners available, i.e. Stevia, WHY ASPERTAME!!!
--------------------
My family and I have been huge fans of Crystal Light Peach Ice Tea for years.... and then they changed the recipe. Now it's "made with Black Tea" and is not very good at all. The actual flavor varies from package to package and from bad to worse. I wonder if Kraft ever heard of the success Coke had in changing their recipe?
--------------------
I stopped drinking carbonated beverages about 6 years ago and Crystal Light has become one of main replacements. I really like this drink but I'm bored. I need new flavors, adult flavors. Pineapple would be great, Watermelon, a fusion of different flavors. Passion fruit. I loved the Mojito you had a couple years ago, a mint tea would be nice. Please give us more variety?
--------------------
Great Stuff, I am a recent kidney transplant patient and need to control my electrolytes, especially potassium. Can you tell me how much potassium is in the lemonade and orange flavor Crystal Light?
--------------------
I have a secret recipe combining diffrent flavors of Crystal Light that everytime I place a pitcher on the table it does'nt last!!! Even with the experienced Crystal Light lovers or the sugar free haters. I'm always asked to contact you because is a hit in all parties and they would like to drink at home.
--------------------
Mo Mo Mojito! I love your Mojito flavored Crystal Light! It was great in cocktails and a delicious combined with Peach Tea! I am trying to replicate it but there is no substitute!! Please bring it back! MO MO MOJITO!!!
--------------------
Delicious! Dissolves easily and great flavor.
--------------------
What happened to their best flavor??? Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink? This was by far the best powdered mix made by anyone and they discontinued it? too bad. the others are good but nothing was like that. BRING IT BACK...please!!!
--------------------
This flavor is getting harder to find in my stores, seems it is being replaced with the more caffeinated variety. It's a shame.
--------------------
I love this flavor. It is getting harder to fine in my area stores. Wondering where I can by the multipack of the Energy Peach mango on the go packs
--------------------
I love this drink. I buy it almost exclusively. But the last time I bought three packages, I was sorely disappointed. I love crystal lite for the taste, but more for the dissolving ability over cheaper brands that fall to the bottom in a clump. Hard to get it to dissolve. Now its no better than the cheapest brand.
--------------------
Really enjoy the flavor. I pour a big (24oz) glass and it's gone before I even notice. Smooth and tasty! I'm constantly making another pitcher! BUT....why does it leave a white residue in the clear pitcher and clear glass. Like there are undissolved solids in the mix and you really should scrub the pitcher after each use. What's with that? Not too 'crystal'. Comes off easily but does not rinse off.
--------------------
Delicious and has almost no calories. Tastes like really good pink lemonade, has ZERO added sugar and is only FIVE calories. You can’t beat that! My kids absolutely love it and I don’t feel guilty giving them some or drinking it myself. When I’m craving something sweet I drink this. The large packets are perfect for pitchers. You literally dump it in with water, stir, and serve. I always make a pitcher to have on hand in the fridge and it lasts us a few days. And I love that it never tastes like anything has separated after it has sat in the fridge for a few days, it doesn’t not need to be stirred again. The price point is spot on and is a money saver for us when it comes to sweet drinks.

--------------------
This was good in my opinion if you like sour things. If you do not, unfortunately, this will not satisfy you. Sorry.
--------------------
This was not for me. I think it's super sour. On the other hand my husband loved it so I guess it wasn't a totally bad purchase
--------------------
Billed as natural, but contains aspartame. Drinking this made me feel like I had arthritis in every joint after a few weeks. Buyer beware.
--------------------
Every single flavor that Crystal Light makes tastes awesome! I have tried them all, and have never been disappointed.
--------------------
Perfect packets for on the go. Great for a small boost of energy when the day has ran long and of course low in calories so I can get something sweet without completely ruining my diet by drinking my calories!
--------------------
I get so bored drinking plain old water everyday. I love these crystal light flavors to bring so me excitement to my hydration. I drink so much more water when I use one or two of these a day. Plus they are so good and tasty! The whole family loves them.
--------------------
This strawberry flavor is awesome. Tangy and sweet. I love the product even more with the small caffeine boost!
--------------------
I love love love these. They taste so delicious. The packaging is great, highly unlikely to break open. These are very easy to put into water to drink! Perfect for school lunches. I would for sure buy again.
--------------------
These are perfect for when I need a boost of caffeine and don't want to grab an energy drink or soda. The taste is great, especially compared to some other brands I've tried. It's sometimes a little hard to mix but other than that I have no complaints
--------------------
Always delicious! These packets are easy to use and taste great. Makes daily water consumption so much more tasty! Highly recommend!
--------------------
I dont know what I would do without this stuff. I literally drink it daily. Has caused me to stop drinking pop
--------------------
These are the absolute best. They taste amazing and give a great burst of energy from the caffeine. Its perfect for on the go and has an amazing flavor. I would recommend this product to anyone and definitely would buy it again.
--------------------
Honestly cant make it through a day without this. Its tasty and caffeinated and I NEED caffeine, but I hate coffee, dont drink energy drinks, and sometimes tea isnt enough. This is perfect for a pick-me-up.
--------------------
I drink this rain every day in my water tasted really good just playing dolls Ill give us a five star rating
--------------------
These are good on the go! Has caffeine in it and it tastes pretty good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
--------------------
These are a great way to up your water intake. Easily thrown in lunch bag, work bag or purse. I leave them in my locker at work so I always have some with me. I get bored with plain water so this helps me drink as much water as I can!
--------------------
I prefer natural, unrefined sweeteners such as stevia or honey but in a pinch this would do if you something flavored and low in calories.
--------------------
I like crystal light because the flavors are great and they are low in calories and sugars. Anytime I’m tired of drinking water I add one of these to satisfy my cravings for sodas or something sweet.
--------------------
These are good to add to ice cold water on a hot day. Hey remind me of the refreshers from Starbucks without as much caffeine.
--------------------
Always a favorite crystal light product!! It’s so good and the caffeine is 100% great!!
--------------------
I buy this product because I do not like to drink water and with this since is tasty I find myself drinking more water
--------------------
Taste is amazing and so convenient. I love the fact that it has extra caffeine! This definitely helps me through the day. I also love how many different flavors there are. The to-go packets fit get in my person so I can add flavor anywhere and any time.
--------------------
I heard about this product thru my boyfriends mom because I pretty much hate water and I’ve been drinking too much soda and sugar. This is a good replacement for it even tho I still miss soda so much.
--------------------
Pretty good. I’m trying to stay away from soda and sugary drinks so I like crystal light. Flavor is pretty good. I add extra water to sort of water it down. I’ve bought crystal light before and I will buy again.
--------------------
My friend turned me onto these little caffeine packets after I didn't being any caffeine with me on a two week field exercise and kept getting awful headaches from withdrawal. The watermelon flavor is so refreshing and the absolute convenience of having my caffeine in the morning with some water is like two birds with one stone!
--------------------
Refreshing. Bold and thirst quenching flavor. So easy to use. In a water bottle to go or a glass at home.
--------------------
I love this for work I drink water all day but when I need something refreshing and fast I us this and it hits the spot
--------------------
I LOVE this drink mix. The flavor is delicious, and the powder dissolves quickly. I also notice that it gives me a strong spurt of energy with the caffeine in it. This is a great pick me up for afternoon slug times. Definitely give this a try!
--------------------
This is a great way to jazz up your water. It helps me drink more water and with the added caffeine, it helps me with my energy. I keep a box of this flavor at work and use a whole packet for my 30oz tumbler and it tastes great.
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite drink! I have one every morning, it's the perfect amount of caffeine & it helps me drink water! Plus - it tastes so good!!
--------------------
My all time favorite drink and flavor. These are always stashed away in my cabinets at home, in my purse and in my desk at work. They’re the perfect pick me up and don’t have an artificial taste to them.
--------------------
Another great flavor my house loves to drink. This crystal light packets are perfect for us when we want some flavor in our lives.
--------------------
Not my first choice because it’s a light flavor. I wish it was stronger. I also wish it was sweeter but I like ￼ sickening sweet
--------------------
Great for adding flavor if you want a little taste to your water! There are SO many different flavors and you can control how much sweetness there is!
--------------------
My family loves the crystal light wild strawberry water flavor powders. They are easy to use and have a great taste.
--------------------
This is a good brand to put in your water. It give the water flavors. No I brought this brand a couple of times. Nothing to improve this product. I drink one package throughout the day. It an excellent flavor. Yes I would buy this brand always. I will recommend this product for others to buy and try out.
--------------------
Personally, I love these add-ons for Waters because sometimes water bottle tastes weird to me. I especially love this flavor but you can't really go wrong because they're all pretty light and easy going.
--------------------
This stuff is gross, so unhealthy for you. I get it you want somthing sweet and this is way better then a cookie or a peace of cake or pie or somthing but it just tastes so fake and not somthing I'd want to put in my body. I know alot of people love it
--------------------
I love this on the go crystal light packet with caffeine. It taste so good and it so much more fun than just regular water! I drink this when i don’t have time for a coffee and it keeps me energized and hydrated!
--------------------
Love love love this! I love the brand in general & they have yet to let me down in anyway. I buy diff things all the time & haven’t been disappointed yet!
--------------------
This is my favorite flavor water enhancer. I only gave it 4 stars because I think you could buy the off brand for cheaper and it tastes the same.
--------------------
I like crystal it has a great taste very flavorful. No room for improvement . I love the fact that it's low in calorie and still have a wonderful strong flavor . It's affordable great value.
--------------------
I’ve been trying to find a way to drink more water. Since the water in New York isn’t that great to drink on its own. Because I only drink faucet water. I mix and Crystal light, wylers light or mio to help me. I don’t put a lot in it sometimes I use half a packet.￼
--------------------
This is definitely delicious. It’s very juicy. It has caffeine in it but I haven’t noticed any effects from the caffeine
--------------------
Love these, they taste great and keep me from drinking soda, also give me a little energy to get through the day
--------------------
The best drink mix to add to a bottle of water! Now that we stopped drinking soda here, we always have a variety of flavors on hand. I will never go back to plain water!
--------------------
Tastes good and gives me a little pick me up without the side effects. There are other caffeine flavors but I like this one most
--------------------
I really like the crystal light that come with caffeine because I am cutting out soda and one of the horrible side effects are the headaches I get from not getting caffeine. These drink mixes alleviate those headaches!
--------------------
Anything strawberry always captures my attention but I love that this is caffeinated, so at times when I want to just drink water in the morning instead, this is great at keeping me hydrated with some taste! And of course, I love adding some crystal light mixed into my titos
--------------------
I like this crystal light flavor I just wished it was tea and not just a fruit flavored drink! I enjoy drinking this packet because it has caffeine added to it which helps me in the morning when I need it the most
--------------------
I can’t function without caffeine and get bored with drinking coffee and water all days so I was looking forward to trying this. The caffeine kick isn’t too strong and it’s a little too sweet for my liking.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite drink mixes ever! I love how it gets me to drink more water! Before I was a coffee drinker, I used to drink this in my morning college classes because it has caffeine! It tastes so good!
--------------------
Loved this as a kid in the summer or made into a popsicle. As an adult, I highly recommend adding tequila for a skinny margarita!
--------------------
Love love love this! I love the brand in general & they have yet to let me down in anyway. I buy diff things all the time & haven’t been disappointed yet!
--------------------
This is a great strawberry flavor. I would recommend if you don’t enjoy drinking water.
--------------------
I use this in my water nearly every day! It is very refreshing! If you like the flavor of strawberry or just get tired of drinking plain water, try a water packet in it! So good!
--------------------
After my weight loss surgery, i have to get in min 90 oz of fluids a day, and these have made my life so much easier! Tasty, refreshing, And definitely had helped a ton!
--------------------
I can’t drink water with out Crystal Light. Changes water and takes it to another level.
--------------------
My fave morning drink. Love the taste and the caffeine boost!! Easy to travel with!
--------------------
There are so many flavors to choose from. Easy to mix. Good taste. Good price. My family likes the choices.
--------------------
These help me drink so much more water than I typically would. It’s so delicious and gives me the little pick me up I need in the afternoons
--------------------
My favorite!!! They taste so good and they make me drink more water throughout the day. I always have this is my house and in my purse for on the go. Perfect for when you’re thirsty but tired of water!
--------------------
It has caffeine and tastes delicious with little to no calories , it is perfect to keep in your purse when you wanna spice up a drink at a restaurant without paying extra
--------------------
This drink mix is so so yummy. I am a nurse and can always use all the caffeine I can get, and sometimes an energy drink just doesn’t sound good, so I bought these. Very affordable and turned out to be super yummy, and still very effective! Definitely recommend!
--------------------
This tastes super good. If you don’t want water you can turn it into juice it just some shakes
--------------------
These are my favorite crystal light drink mix. Gives your energy without the extra sugar. The flavor is great.
--------------------
I love all crystal light flavors but this is my favorite keep it up love it I am a repeat consumer and it’s very affordable I wouldn’t change a thing
--------------------
Love this flavor. I love the pick me up the caffeine in these has. Great alternative to drinking soda.
--------------------
This is perfect for any hot day where you need to cool off with some flavor! I’ve tried this so many times and am not stopping anytime soon
--------------------
Love adding this to my water. This flavor is a little too intense. I typically use one packet to 32 oz of water.
--------------------

I love these. Water can get boring sometimes and these are perfect for that. They are so easy to use and super affordable.

Love strawberry so I bought this and loved it. Price is good. Taste is good. Mixes well. Doesn’t sit at the bottom
--------------------
I was excited to see strawberry my favorite flavor with caffeine which is kind of exciting you could get your kicks without drinking coffee or soda pop but this has like all other products from this brand a terrible aftertaste I don’t like the sweetener they use I wish they would switch it to something different that doesn’t give you that icky flavor when you’re done drinking if you get cold enough you can tolerate it and get through it but it’s just offputting and the price for these is just asinine
--------------------
We love this juice mix! We always mix it with our vodka, especially when it’s hot and sunny out.
--------------------
I absolutely love these. They taste very similar to the Starbucks drink I’d have fewer calories and are so much cheaper. I have to keep these around the house at all times. I also love the fact that they contain caffeine￼
--------------------
Sometimes it’s good. Other times it’s not perfect. Still a drink mix regardless. Add water and shake
--------------------
Crystal Light is my favorite drink mix brand. This flavor does not disappoint. It is great to use as a mixer as well! Yum!
--------------------
Me encanta el sabor y la frescura de esta bebida es realmente deliciosa y todos los sabores me encantan

These dont taste like fake sweetener. Nice flavor. Easy to take to work for when youre sick of water.
--------------------
I love these little packets! They taste great and are just what I need at 2:00 in the afternoon when you start to feel sluggish while at work!

Adding Crystal Light to my water makes me drink enough throughout the day! It tastes so good but isnt packed with sugar.

--------------------
I have a hard time drinking water in general and these help give my water flavor and a kick of caffeine to help me get my water intake in the mornings!
--------------------
When I only have bottled water to drink and in the mood for some flavor crystal light is my go to. I enjoy all the flavors they have.
--------------------
As a child my mom refused to buy us coolaid. She always bought crystal light. And honestly its good, I still drink it sometimes today. Adds nice flavor if you dont want to drink regular water.
--------------------
We have bought alot of boxes of crystal light powered strips. This is a must have if you have children or if you are simply someone who works alot and spends time out and about.
--------------------
I love the taste and its so easy to make all you need is a water bottle and that packet. So easy and fast just dump it inside the bottle and done I would for sure reccomend thsi to others.

Pantry Market Sugar Free Fruit is my Favor diet type Kool Aid like drink. I use to mix some meds in that I must take twice a day. The meds taste awful in water but in Fruit Punch they are awesome and I drink them with Breakfast and Diner. I enjoy the fresh taste, I have tried other favors and other drinks but always come but to P. M.'s Fruit Punch. I even order in my packages I get with other need supplies. (I am handicapped and shopping is hard) So I have it mailed to me. It is awesome.
--------------------
Best fruit punch mix I've tasted
--------------------
This is the best fruit punch you will find.
--------------------
The BEST I have ever tasted.
--------------------
So easy to pour in a water bottle shake and drink. Easy to leave one in my gym bag or purse to take on the go.
--------------------
Im not a fan of crystal light but this wasnt bad. Overall pretty average for powdered Lem
--------------------
I always keep crystal light on me when I go anywhere. I dont drink sodas much and sometimes plain water tastes weird at restaurants so I like to add a flavor packet. Not only is it convenient, its single serving and has no sugars or carbs which is great for diabetics! It has a nice lemonade flavor and doesnt taste overly artificial to me. They also are great to slip into your bag for a night out. I mix crystal light sometimes with Titos and water for a low carb/sugar drink!
--------------------
I always have a ton of these in my bag for backpacking trips. It's an easy way to get more water in if you're someone who doesn't drink enough. They're easy to open and use and the trash packs down really small so it isnt in the way. I ALWAYS have at least ten packets
--------------------
This is a great drink mix! It has no sugar but its sweet and a bit tangy. Love it. Will buy again
--------------------
This was one of my favorite drink mixes growing up and it was great to have lemon aid if you wanted it at the drop of a hat .
--------------------
Crystal light is something I reach for when I want flavor in my water, specifically during a meal. I always get the lemonade flavor, or versions of lemonade, because I think it tastes the best. 10/10 loveeee
--------------------
Our daughter drinks this daily. We needed to incorporate more water into her diet and she doesnt like the taste of plain water. This has helped her drink more and really enjoys the flavor. We buy it weekly.
--------------------
I love these single packs to enhance my water. I have been drinking crystal light since I was a child. I love it.
--------------------
I absolutely love crystal light lemonade on-the-go sticks! They are a great, low calorie substitute for other drinks! I love that it is convenient and tasty! Its definitely better than other alternatives that claim taste good!!
--------------------
....Convenient and Full on lemon flavor. Quick and easy to prepare and to enjoy whenever in my opinion....
--------------------
I love these. They taste great and are so easy to carry with you everywhere. I would definitely recommend. The price is reasonable
--------------------
I get tired of drinking plain water all the time. This helps to spice it up and keep it interesting. Nice to switch it up from time to time.
--------------------
These get the job done of adding flavor to water, I believe these are sugar free which is nice to make as a cocktail mixer. The packaging is okay, nothing too high end. It is a little too sweet for my liking
--------------------
So very good. Been drinking since i was a teenager. It does not get old. And does not taste bad at all. Can easily take in more water this way.
--------------------
Always delicious! These packets are easy to use and taste great. Makes daily water consumption so much more tasty! Highly recommend!
--------------------
I love these lemonade drink packets because they're portable, inexpensive and a great value. They taste delicious and are low in sugar. . I wouldn't change a thing with it. The package is petite and easy to tote. I'd buy again and recommend.
--------------------
I have an addiction to Crystal Light lol. The traditional lemonade is my all time favorite. I love the single pouches you can mix with a bottle of water because its easy to have on the go or at work when youre away from home.
--------------------
These are so tasty and convenient! Just throw them in your purse and add to any water! Its a great aid to help get off soda.
--------------------
Have a pitcher in the fridge every summer. Tasty no calories and refreshing.I like it and it doesn't taste chemically
--------------------
Crystal Light Lemonade On-The-Go Powdered Drink Mix is one of my favorite go to for adding flavor to my water. It fits in my purse so it is always is ready
--------------------
This was really good! It was a bit too sweet for me, so I added about 3/4 pack.
--------------------
At least two of the individual packets arrived opened and the powder inside was solid like a puck.
--------------------
I love this refresh beverage. Have a good and natural taste. No have calories. Have a very good price and i recomended
--------------------
Makes a delicious lemonade just add to your water bottle and go. Great for those hot days
--------------------
Quintessential summertime drink made easy. I love that these are easy for kids to use, and healthier than alternatives full of sugar.
--------------------
A great lemonade on the go that is calorie free. My kids love this as well. Will continue to purchase!
--------------------
Crystal Light Lemonade Powdered Drink Mix is my mother’s favorite brand, I enjoy this and all other flavors including Grape, Strawberry, and Fruit Punch. There isn’t one flavor I do not like as you can tell by my attached photo. Unfortunately, my local grocers are eliminating the brand from our stores as the price of the product continues to go up. I am able to locate some bargains at other retail vendors, but it’s a shame to have to go that route. Our family has been purchasing Crystal Light since it debuted in the 80’s.
--------------------
I always have this around. Calories are low already, but I only use about 1/2 a packet per 24oz because it’s sweeter than I want.
--------------------
Yummy stuff and i buy it often. Its pretty cheap. The taste is great and it’s refreshing. I would recommend this to anyone looking for sugar alternative drinks.
--------------------
Love the crystal light in lemonade. Great for diabetics. No weird after taste. Really good and refreshing. Price good.
--------------------
I love the crystal light to go packs. I have had several flavors. They are easy to carry on my purse and I just pop@them in my water wherever I am
--------------------
When I am going to work or on a walk I always throw one of these in my water bottle to keep me drinking water and staying hydrated!
--------------------
This is really good as far as powdered drink mixes go. Always makes it easier to drink water when it has some nice flavoring like this.
--------------------
This is a great alternative when you are wanting a sweet drink without all of the sugar!
--------------------
Best way for me to drink more water by having it be calorie free lemonade￼. I like lemonade but don’t want the sugar.
--------------------
I love crystal light packets! I try and not have pop in the house so I always have crystal light for if I am craving something sweet. And they aren’t bad for you but you feel like you are getting a treat!!!
--------------------
Love these for on the go. It is a little sweet for me but I can get 2-3 used out of one single serve packet and customize the sweetness how I like. I will continue to repurchase
--------------------
Everyone gets bored of water but obviously we are required to drink it. The crystal light sugar free powder mixers are my favorite for flavoring my water.
--------------------
Quick and easy way to make lemonade in your water bottle. Just open the back and pour it in. Shake it and boom you have lemonade. It tastes amazing even though it’s sugar free. And it’s great to add flavor to bland water. I use it when I need to have more water and just mix in a lemonade water here and there.
--------------------
These are great especially if you’re looking for an easy way to cute calories but still want your sweet fix.
--------------------
This is a great product! I love that it’s sugar free and mixes so easily in a bottle of water!
--------------------
Delicious lemonade with low calories. You can buy it in single serve packets or 2 quart packets. I usually buy these to mix with alcohol in the summer and they hit the spot!

--------------------
Nice tasting and super convenient. Great to have on hand when you get a glass of water with an icky taste or you just want something sweet.
--------------------
I love mixing the crystal light lemonade with any kind of tea to make a Arnold Palmer type drink with less sugar!!! Highly recommend and so affordable
--------------------
I drink a lot of water with ice and once in a while I want some flavor in it. So I will I have some lemonade Crystal light it’s good and no aftertaste￼
--------------------
I love putting this in cold water on a hot day. It’s a little tangy but I like it like that.
--------------------
These tastes so good. Add some sliced lemons and fresh mint and you have a perfect summer refresher.
--------------------
This has been helping me replace juice because my cravings have been crazy and i love it. One pack lasts me a few days. I love that it’s not a strong lemonade but also sweet. Highly recommend to help you get away from juice.
--------------------
This is the best way for me to drink lots of water and making it so easy and delicious. So many flavor options as well!
--------------------
Tastes good! Quick and easy to use. Can carry in purse for a lil extra sweetness. Tart,, but you can add less if you prefer!
--------------------
This is a great water enhancer. It tastes great and is super refreshing on a hot day. I buy this all the time and it’s usually gone in two days. I like that it isn’t too sweet but has enough of a kick to keep you on your toes. :)
--------------------
Makes drinking water easier. Convenient and reasonably priced. This is the perfect product and I will always continue to purchase
--------------------
I love these little on the go packet's! They are perfect for the office when you need something sweet! The best part is that it's low calorie and sugar!!
--------------------
Tangy yet sweet, as lemonade should be. Good for summer trips with family, and enough flavors to suit everyone’s tastes. One packet is enough for a 16oz bottle of water, but can come on strong, so I recommend splitting a packet between 2 bottles.
--------------------
This is good to put in your bottled water. Sometimes, I get a craving for a Citrus drink. This quenches my thirst
--------------------
Very good and flavorful and refreshing and not as bad for you as others seen. Doesn’t have the bitter taste others have too.
--------------------
Fun flavors for water. A good way to keep cals low and steer you away from fizzy drinks. Very tasty and fun to use and shake up
--------------------
We use these a lot in our household. It's simple to make and is refreshing. It's not the real deal but good enough.
--------------------
Light and tasteful! Blends well into water and easy on the go. You can get your water intake without feeling as guilty about a different flavor!
--------------------
I have to admit these taste great. I only purchase them because my husband loves them, it’s the only way he consumes water. But I personally am not a fan because of the artificial sweeteners used in the formula. I wish they would use stevia
--------------------
This stuff is so good and convenient! It tastes so lemony and is nice and tangy! It isn't the healthiest, but it is a great drink!
--------------------
After weight loss surgery, you have to drink 90+ oz of fluids a day and can only have sugar free drinks. This stuff saved my life, quite literally. Love it so much.
--------------------
Great tasting & affordable. I honesty didn't think I was going to like it due to it being sugar free but it's really delicious.
--------------------
I LOVE having a big, tall pitcher ready in the summertime. It can have a little bit of a weird aftertaste sometimes, but I like it.
--------------------
When it comes to lemonade, crystal light is always my first pick . I love the refreshing taste.
--------------------
I usually pick these packets in the summer cause water didn’t really do it for me and with crystal light I can stay hydrated.
--------------------
The packets make the water taste more like sugar than like a lemonade. You can’t taste the tartness of the lemons like you would in a Have a great day! Squeezed glass but if you have a large party where you need to supply beverages, then this might work for you.
--------------------
This lemonade is a staple for all year long especially if you are trying to stay away from sugar. It still gives you the taste of regular lemonade and you seriously can’t tell the difference. I recommend it.
--------------------
Crystal light is a very good low calorie lemonade my family usually makes it with iced tea and lemonade moxed like an Arnold Palmer and it’s so good
--------------------
I love the small packets, make it so easy to have with me at all times. I keep some in my purse and in my daughters diaper bag. I drink more water using these packets and I don’t have to feel bad about sharing with my daughter.
--------------------
These just tasted like straight sugar. I was disappointed. Will not be purchasing again.
--------------------
I don’t think there’s anything better than lemonade on a hot summer day. I love the taste, and that it’s sugar free!
--------------------
I love the taste of Crystal Light lemonade ! And I love most sugar free drinks so this has two positive points right off the bat for me. As a mom of two busy kiddos it's nice to have things to stick in my purse and kid backpacks!
--------------------
My favorite diet lemonade. It taste great and very refreshing. I live this with some club soda too
--------------------
This is a little bit strong for a water bottle. But if you add a little bit more water it tastes a lot better. I love lemonade that’s normally all I drink. Highly recommend this one as well￼
--------------------
Always hits the spot. This is healthy and tastes amazing I definitely definitely recommend this brand and this exact drink. But lemme tell u the raspberry lemonade is almost like a hundred times better than this one. But you should definitely buy it
--------------------
This and the great value are the only lemonade mixes we enjoy. They are affordable have a great flavor! Sugar free is a huge plus. It’s also super easy to make.
--------------------
I’ve drank crystal light in my water since as long as I can remember. It’s the o my way I can drink a ton of water. This stuff has been a lifesaver since I’ve started driving 70-90 ounces of water every day. Flavor is great. I mix with my collagen unflavored peptides.
--------------------
These hit the spot every time! I just toss them in my purse and tear it open when needed.
--------------------
Water gets boring so I love to mix it up with this lemonade! My mom who is diabetic is able to drink it too so it's great! The flavor is delicious and it's super easy to mix and doesn't leave a chalky taste in your mouth
--------------------
I have been drinking this for years and makes drinking water so much easier. It doesn’t cause me to get more thirsty. Taste great.
--------------------
I drink A LOT of water every single day and sometimes by the end of the day I need a little bit of flavor. These packets are so good and also guilt free because they are sugar free. I substitute these in place of soda cravings. I love them and they are so easy to use.
--------------------
I’m actually really impressed with this. I love how it’s sugar free and doesn’t have much calories. The taste is really great with no after taste or funny taste.
--------------------
We drink a lot of water but sometimes you want something to switch it up. Crystal Light on the go packers are perfect to keep in the car when traveling for those who want something other than plain water.
--------------------
This tastes great. It is great for those watching their sugars. There are other more affordable options
--------------------
I have a hard time just drinking plain water￼ so these have been a life saver. I get that sweet taste of lemonade without all the added sugar and can take it with me on the go. ￼
--------------------
My favorite lemonade mix! Doesn’t need any extra sugar and it’s easy to take from place to place
--------------------
I will always use crystal light. It does not taste too sugary like other brands and it has just the right amount of flavor that you need to feel refreshed.
--------------------
These have a great flavor. Even my kids enjoy it and I like that it’s sugar free and doesn’t cost an arm and a leg
--------------------
On the go lemonade? Don't mind if I do! Nice packaging & easy to pack or keep in your purse. Tastes great. My aunt has always gotten this brand for her lemonade.
--------------------
My kids and I absolutely love these country time lemonade. They can't even tell that they don't have sugar in them. My daughter has Type 1 diabetes so we have to keep drinks that have zero carbs. These are great value for the price. I would recommend these to anyone!#yummy#summer #lemonade #CountryTime #Sommer
--------------------
I absolutely love Crystal light. The lemonade, however is not my favorite. I do love the peach tea the best. But when I’m in the mood for a good iced lemonade, Crystal light is the way to go. The package is Easy to use and is the ideal mixture for one bottled water. I highly recommend Crystal light products
--------------------
These are super sweet. Make sure to add just a half a packet or add more water than it calls for. Overall it tastes good. Especially mixed with Tito’s!
--------------------
They’re ok. I prefer Wyler’s instead of Crystal light. These taste OK but it is not what I’m used to
--------------------
Great for a trip. Can use part of the package if you do not want it very sweet. More flavor availability
--------------------
It’s definitely not the worst lemonade I’ve tried but it does lack a lot of flavor. I wouldn’t purchase again
--------------------
Out all them this one favorite one . I grew up drinking kool-aid to this day we still make it on hot day.
--------------------
My favorite kool-aid flavor. It’s delicious with or without sugar. Definitely a great summer drink.
--------------------
I love this the ease of it, I also really enjoy that when I don’t want to make a Full pitcher I can make just one cup
--------------------
Great for summer days and evenings with friends! My mom always used this Kool-Aid and I loved it every time!
--------------------
I have been buying this since I was little and my whole family loves it. It lasts forever and taste so good!
--------------------
I grew up on kool-aide as a kid. It does require a lot of sugar that is the only down side. As a kid I used to cut out the points on the back of the individual packages and send them away for prizes. This was a genius marketing move in my opinion. The best prize I got was a popsicle maker. You poured kool-aide into the mold, put a popsicle stick in it, put it in the freezer and then 5 hours later like magic it made 6 popsicles. It was perfect for the hot summer days, swimming in the pool in Phoenix. The things we remember as kids.
--------------------
We are a family of 5 so kool-aid is a staple in our household. My children and my husband both love this flavor along with most all other kool-aid flavors. Super simple to make a big pitcher of it up with these instead of opening all the individual packets. Takes less sugar but still has that same great taste. Affordable and highly recommend for those busy moms looking to save time and a buck.
--------------------
I’m not going to lie, I do love Kool Aid but I just never buy it because it’s just pure sure and I know it’s so bad. Once in a blue moon I’ll buy one because it does taste so good and is nostalgic.
--------------------
I like the taste of this product. It is really easy to make and it taste just like fruit punch.
--------------------
Kool-aid Tropical punch soft drink mix is too sweet for my taste. I grow up drinking kool aid. There are many flavors to try.
--------------------
This is a yummy summer drink! It taste really good and the jar is a really good value for your money
--------------------
My son and daughter love this juices specially know that we in summer this juice its refreshing and it dose not need ally of sugar and is caffeine free.
--------------------
Since it’s asking for powdered, this is the kind we have used, maybe not the flavor though. Just for convenience. But, like I said with the nesquick, trying to stay away from powders because of the messiness. Definitely don’t like the single packets though.
--------------------
So easy to make and perfect for a hot summer day. Great for people of all ages. Wouldn’t change anything about this
--------------------
This punch is delicious on a hot summer day. You can make several different treats with this punch and it contains less sugar than soda which is great.
--------------------
This kool-aid mix is easy to mix and the kids love it! It’s affordable and you can make a lot of it!!
--------------------
This is the classic koolAid from my childhood. Perfect for lemonade stands. The packaging is cool looking and pops. The package is also good for this product and makes it easy to use. I would recommend
--------------------
I like them theses are really easy to use and taste really good come in handy when your on the ho you can find theses at any grocery store and they're fairly cheap I recommend this product and I will definitely be purchasing more
--------------------

--------------------
I think this product is easy to make and a good drink itself. One that isnt as bad compared to cokes and other drinks. I like that it can be made in large amounts perfect for parties too. I would buy again. :)
--------------------
It is extremely sweet. Have to be weary of how much you put in. But a very good flavour and no improvement needed. Has very nice packaging and great color. I would buy again for sure.
--------------------
This is perfect family size kool-aid! The flavor is tropical and refreshing! I make a whole pitcher and keep it refrigerated for anyone who wants some. Would highly recommend and I will be repurchasing!
--------------------
Always buying this for the kids and friends especially in the summer. Easy to make and tastes good
--------------------
Great to have on hand when the kids all come over at once. So easy to mix up and the kids love the taste
--------------------
I love this drink when its hot outside or you need a fast punch for a childs party comes in handy
--------------------
Mis hijas les encanta el kool aid con poco rinde bastante, muy codiciado en el verano despus de llegar de la escuela para refrescarse y econmico.
--------------------
I used to buy this all the time but have stopped because Im trying to be healthier. It is a great product for everyone who likes kool aid you can make it super sweet or delude it to make it not as sweet
--------------------
This has been a top favourite for so long, i load up on them cause me and my boyfriend are obsessed if you like the regular blue one youll most likely love this one also! Hope this never discontinues cause im gonna stay buying it, highly. Recommend
--------------------
Thee best drink ever as a kid and an adult. Tropical punch is the best flavor and If made right will keep you coming back for more.
--------------------
This is simply amazing. I'm totally in love with this product. I definitely reccomend everyone trying this. You will not be disappointed. Best purchase ever. Do yourself a favor and purchase this now. I absolutely love love love this. It's a godsend.
--------------------
My family loves this stuff, we used to make it every couple of days once we finish the pitcher. My dad would tell the kids to make it if they finish the last sip! Its great and flavorful!
--------------------
Kool aid brings me back to my childhood days my grandmother would always have some made to drink and freeze them up to icees for a snack. Lol love them
--------------------
Honestly a classic!! I put a little bit into my water with a little bit of sweetener and it makes for a refreshing drink!
--------------------
I always have this on hand for either my son or granddaughter. I like the price and it gives them something beside water to drink. The nice thing is for my granddaughter I control how many spoonfuls of the powder to give her
--------------------
My little brother and I love this! Its so convenient because the tub makes so many batches of juice I love it
--------------------
My kids love them. I get so they can take to school or have when they come home after school.
--------------------
I grew up drinking this and now that im older i buy it every now and then and make my drink and also have it when i go eat wings !
--------------------
These are so good I know its bad for you but imagine on a hot sunny day and a cup of ice cold kool aid cant resist
--------------------
My mom does like to give us artificially food this would be an exceptional. She would done this flavor water once in a while
--------------------
My favorite kool aid flavor and easy to mix with water powder. I just grab a bottle water and pour some mix in. It’s better than drinking soda!
--------------------
Love this so does my family easy to just mix and drink its easy and it has such a great flavor !
--------------------
A childhood memory! Love this stuff. Only drink it once in awhile now, but its still just as good. Mom still makes it at their house
--------------------
Out of all the kool aid flavors, this one is my favorite. Tastes so fruity and sweet.
--------------------
The best tropical punch powdered drink its easy to make and very delicious tasty i do recommend specially if you have kids they will love it

Ive always loved sweet kool Aid. Especially on those hot summer days or any day. I think this stuff taste delicious and you should really try it.
--------------------
Flavor isnt that well unless you add a ton of sugar since its sugar free. Perfect for kids though and any other get together. Flavor is pretty good as well.
--------------------
This stays on deck in our house. The perfect go to drink that has become a staple from my childhood now well into adulthood. How could you not love Kool Aid?
--------------------
This powdered drink is super good and will last you quite a long time.. have bought it several times in the big container! Really good to make popsicles
--------------------
Kool -aid everything is amazing and delicious in every way I can never get enough of this childhood favorite
--------------------
I like the taste of this kool aid tropical punch.. i only buy 2 or 3 powdered drink products and this is one of them.. apart from its affordable, it also has good flavor ... its our go to after meal drink if we wanted some cold mix juice.. we usually mix lemon in it to add that tangy flavor..
--------------------
Love tropical punch. I always begged my mom to get me these as a kid, I still drink it from time to time.
--------------------
Koolaid is a staple item here during, I love all the flavors they offer and you can use them for so many other things like dying your hair and eggs for Easter time. The packaging is and always will be great and it's very familiar to everyone and yes I'll recommend this
--------------------
This is nostalgia in a can. I love to pour a lot of sugar in mine on a hot summer day.
--------------------
My fiance loves this one. He prefers this flavor over the others. He tend to have the single ones that you can just put in a water bottle. He says its really good.
--------------------
Hands down the BEST flavor of Kool-Aid made is the tropical punch. Plus it has multiple drink purposes....perfect for the little ones and kids under 21yrs of age and add a little vodka or your choice of liquor for a tropical mixed drink in the summer!! Boom that's a win!!
--------------------
My favorite kool-aid flavor since I was a kid has been tropical punch. It is so good and has a great flavor. The price is always super affordable whether its in small packets or the big family size can. You can find it at just about any market.
--------------------
This is so cheap. The amount of sugar you put in this, holy cow. Diabetes, here I come! I feel like the powdered drink taste better than the actual juice pouches. It has a better flavor, maybe because we can control the sugar in it. I would recommend but make better healthy choices.
--------------------
Love tropical punch kool aid. Making this at home is great since you can add in however much sugar you would like.
--------------------
I was raised drinking kool-aid & now I buy it for my sons & grand baby! They love all the flavors, but fruit punch is one of their all time favorites! I buy the big container, you get more product, I think!
--------------------
We get one of these for Christmas every year. Koolaid is soooo easy and it makes the kiddos happy. I like the tub bc I dont like to have to add sugar. it tastes great and lasts about a month for the big tub.
--------------------
My kids love this powdered drink! I also love it because it is really easy to make. All you have to do is just add water. So the kids can make a pitcher without having to wait for me to measure sugar. The big container can be purchased at your local wholesale store.
--------------------
Kool-Aid is just too sugary for me. I dont like it when I mix it with the water but it doesnt dissolve as quick when Im mixing it. Its affordable, but just not my favorite to drink.
--------------------
A classic as a child growing up. These were awesome and so easy to make. Will continue to purchase
--------------------
Ill always love kool aid. Its super easy to make and is a really good summer time drink. Very sugary but tastes sooooooooooo good. Packaging is nice and its very fast. I would recommend to others its also affordable!
--------------------
I love that this product tells you how much koolaid to add compared to the little packets. The only con that I dont like is that I feel like Im using too many scoops. It seems like a lot of sugar. I dont make this too often because of that reason, but its such a nice refreshing treat during the summer
--------------------
My favorite flavor! Great taste and easy to make. It has. Great price and is refreshing on a hot day. My kids love it as a treat
--------------------
I grew up on this I love this stuff. This was always in our house. You can make single glasses of juices because there is sugar in it already. It's very convenient.
--------------------
I love this mix because its super easy to make and the taste is amazing!! Not too sugary and not too watery tasting either
--------------------
Love this juice. Dissolves great and an amazing flavour. If anyone didnt know you can also semi permanently dye your hair with it not too sugary like other powdered juice I find
--------------------
Kool aid has been around since I was little and its the best all you need is 3 ingredients water sugar and kool aid its perfect for any occasion and its so cheap its worth buying and worth having for something to make real quick or dinner. Highly recommended this try all flavors you wont be dissapointed
--------------------
My favorite flavor of all times. I grew up on kool-aid when I was younger. Very easy to make and it's perfect in the summer time
--------------------
Best drink on a warm summer day to remind me of my childhood. So easy and fast to make
--------------------
I love this fruit punch it is so delicious I don't know maybe it's my love for red drinks but this definitely had some personal childhood great feeling I will drink this for the rest of my life LOL
--------------------
I love KooolAid !! However i only drank it at parties and such cause my mom didnt buy anything that wasnt healthy lol tropical punch wws my favorite
--------------------
My better half always request that we have this on hand so we can make this all the time so we can have this anytime for a drink of choice
--------------------
This koolaid is the one to always go for since i was a little girl. My mom would always buy me this one and i would be the koolaid maker lol
--------------------
From I was a child until now this was my favorite powder drink mix.. It has a sweet and sour flavor and very refreshing when you mix it the proper way (not too much sugar). It's the only powered drink I usually use. Definitely recommend it to others
--------------------
Great substitute for a soda! The powder form makes it last longer! Delicious flavors!
--------------------
This is one of my favorite Kool-Aid flavors this is been around since I was young I use this all the time because I have four kids they have many different flavors to choose from and can be found at almost any store it is very affordable it is normally 245 or 250 a bottle or they have it in the packages for $0.25 a piece but the small packages you have to add your own sugar the bottle like this you do not have to add your own sugar you just add water so it is very good for on the go I definitely recommend this and I will definitely be a repeat buyer
--------------------
I remember drinking this as a kid, now I can just remember it was to acidic for my tasting
--------------------
Super sugary but tastes great! Not expensive at all, quick and easy to make. Definitely will buy again! Also, the packaging is super convenient!!
--------------------
I grew up on this kind of kool-aid and now my kids love it! Cept for it being a bit sugary so we dont often have it
--------------------
What person doesnt like kool aid. This isnt always in my pantry because I like to switch it up with drinks for my kids but when i do have this on hand its always a win-win.
--------------------
I love Kool-Aid its my go to drink and its affordable. I definitely recommend this soft drink.
--------------------
One of my fave kool-aid flavors! Kool-aid is the best drink you can make! Its so refreshing and cool and crisp!
--------------------
I love how simple it is to make Kool-Aid and how flavorful it is. I grew up with my parents making it for us, and even now I still make it. Its also super budget friendly!
--------------------
I love kool aid products! It has a very strong tropical punch taste that was perfect to make kool aid pickles with my class! Yum!
--------------------
I only use sugar free juice when it comes to my children its a great value great price and taste very good
--------------------
My kids love this Kool-Aid great hes easy to make we go to this so much highly recommend
--------------------
Favor flavor of kool-Aid! It gives you that awesome taste after freshly made , add some ice it makes it so much better!
--------------------
Me and my family love to buy this kool aid container it last long for us cause we are a big family and taste great !
--------------------
I am not the biggest kool aid fan but my family is. This sweetened powdered tub if kool aid is so easy and convenient and I do recommend
--------------------
Refreshing and full of flavor. Nice fair size packages at a great price. Would not change
--------------------
My family loves kool-aid and I love the canister that way we can mix a glass at a time and it saves on space in the fridge from a big pitcher. I usually have 1-2 canisters in the cupboard at all times. Our favorite flavor is the tropical punch
--------------------
As a kid we used to get the packets that you had to mix sugar into and for me it always felt like the sugar did not dissolve well enough so as a grown up I purchased the one that already has the sugar in it for the perfect flavor every single time Kool aid cubes can be made with the liquid as well so that whenever you put the ice cubes in your glass of Kool aid it doesn't water down with just regular water it now waters down with the kooaid itself
--------------------
This is a nice and easy drink to make for those hot summer days, it is kid approved and it is the perfect drink for a normal day as well. You can never go wrong with this drink. Cheap and easy to make.
--------------------
I remember growing up on this stuff. I didnt even realize it was still around until I seen it in the store a bit ago. I dont buy this for my kids. But this was always my favourite flavour as a kid.
--------------------
Best drink ever. This is what takes me back to my childhood. I love the flavor. I love everything about it even though its probably not the healthiest drink its still delicious. this drink is great for parties because you can make mass amounts and it still tastes delish!
--------------------
This lemonade tastes great when made per the instructions. I like the ease of these pitcher packs - no measuring powder, just dump into the pitcher of water and mix.
--------------------
This is super refreshing if you want a quick refreshing drink in the summer! Its delicious and will quench your thirst
--------------------
Its nice, but after seeing a nutritionist, she suggested using a product with Stevia in it. I would suggest Crystal Light maybe adding some form like that as an option. I do enjoy the flavor selections, but have found another brand that is outstanding and offers me what Im looking for.
--------------------
I thought Crystal light would taste fake or dietie tastingbif that makes any sense but i love crystal light
--------------------
Would drink this all the time to slowly start to get me to drink water. So easy to use. Convenient. Can get anywhere. Can use as little or as much as you want too!
--------------------
I get so bored drinking plain old water everyday. I love these crystal light flavors to bring so me excitement to my hydration. I drink so much more water when I use one or two of these a day. Plus they are so good and tasty! The whole family loves them.
--------------------
Perfect, guilt free lemonade! When trying to be cautious about what I am eating and drinking, this is my go to, to satisfy my cravings! Great taste.
--------------------
This is a staple in my household. We don't buy juice or soda AT ALL. Milk, water, coffee, and Crystal Light is what we have. LOL My 6 year old loves it as do I. We always have a pitcher in the fridge and with the lack of sugar it's great for our entire family! Delicious and guilt free!
--------------------
In my house we usually only drink, water, milk, or lemonade with our meals (other than coffee in the morning of course) and this is our go to lemonade brand. Theres really not much you could do to mess up a lemonade mix but this brand has other beat because of the price.
--------------------
Convenient and delicious. I appreciate the low calorie options. I keep these in my desk drawer when I have a taste for something other than water.
--------------------
Crystal Light lemonade is a pretty yummy drink mix! They are also inexpensive and easy to find at most stores!
--------------------
I mis this with tea for a go to for my family thats sweet but not a soda or a juice drink thats full of sugar. Its way better for you than a soft drink or even a glass of apple juice.
--------------------
I really like a lot of different Crystal light mixes but this is my absolute favorite!
--------------------
I like to drink Crystal Light Lemonade plain or mixed with Constant Comment tea. It has a natural lemonade flavor and is wonderful in skinny margaritas too. I have been buying it for years. A must try for lemonade lovers.
--------------------
Very good, not too artificial tasting. Not quite exactly what youd get from a homemade batch of lemonade, but pretty close.
--------------------
Love this on a hot day!! Mixes up real good and tastes like homemade only easier!!
--------------------
This is a favorite in my daycare, when we get tired of milk and water. I love that its sugar free!
--------------------
If you want lemonade thats easy to make and perfectly tart & sweet, theres no better option than Crystal Light Drink Mix. I have such fond memories of drinking this at barbecues and picnics! It was the go-to for a cold drink thatll satisfy a large crowd... Plus, it doesnt have a high amount of sugar like most other lemonades and soft drinks. It also comes in convenient to-go packets that can turn any bottle of water into a tasty bottle of lemonade in an instant. Nothing bad to say about Crystal Light!
--------------------
Man, why wasnt Crystal Light around when I was a kid?! I grew up on Kool-Aid... the one that calls for a cup of sugar in the pitcher! No sugar in this, tastes great alone or with a splash (or 2, or 3) of vodka Crystal Light Lemon Iced Tea Powdered Drink Mix
--------------------
I luv me some crystal light it doesn't have alot of calories but doesn't taste bad at all its great i don't drink alot of sugary things anymore but water does get boring so this is a good alternative
--------------------
Just do not like artificial sweeteners like sweet-n-low, eww!! Not a fan! My step mother liked it and she said better for diabetics but still not my thing.
--------------------
I love lemonade, but I really like this one, easy to make and taste great with lunch ,or dinner, my children like it also
--------------------
I love this crystal light drink mix. Love the taste of it. It is so refreshing. It is def. a 5 star
--------------------
These lemonade packets are so convenient! The fact that they are already pre measured, makes it quick and easy to make. It taste really good as well.
--------------------
I love lemonade and I really enjoy this product because it really taste like if you're actually eating a lemon I love it
--------------------
I have had this drink since I was a kid. This stuff is so cheap. Crystal light is a healthier version of Kool-aid with vitamins lol.
--------------------
Tastes good, mixes easy into water. I am not crazy about the artificial stuff, but this isn't bad in a pinch.
--------------------
These individual packets are very convenient to use. I keep a few in my gym bag and my purse. It has a great lemonade flavor and is about the same price as similar products. I would recommend to others
--------------------
Great for on the go! Just pour it in a water bottle and shake. Tastes great and doesnt cost too much!
--------------------
Crystal light is in my humble opinion the best sugar free drink mix on the market. . It has a sweet and tangy flavor and the taste is unmistakable. I love lemonade with a slice of fresh lemon in it. That is my favorite. I would definitely recommend it.
--------------------
Ok diet lemonade. It has a little bit of a bitter taste and a bit of an artificial taste. The price is good. It does taste great when its real cold it quenches your thirst!
--------------------
I LOVE the lemonade crystal light packets. You get great value for the price and the packets are so convenient on the Go. If youre looking for sweet drink but without all the sugar I would recommend this flavor by crystal light. You wont be disappointed.
--------------------
My family loves crystal light and can go through multiple pitchers a day! This is a great product and the low calories make it even better. I’m glad I can still drink lemonade without all the added sugar!
--------------------
I’m shocked at how good this is. My grandma is diabetic so she drinks these and I’ve snuck some from time to time lol. This is good y’all and I hate “light” stuff
--------------------
There is always a pitcher of crystal light lemonade in my refrigerator in the summer. No calories tastes great no chemical aftertaste
--------------------
I’m horrible at drinking water but adding this lemonade mix to a pitcher of water has really helped! It’s a sweet but tangy flavor that’s refreshing and not overly sweet. It’s cheap and easy. I’d recommend this!
--------------------
Crystal light lemonade drink mix is our go to drink in our family it’s affordable it taste great we love everything about this product mix as well it taste great I buy it all the time and will continue to buy it
--------------------
I love this stuff. I buy it in the biggest packages I can because we drink so much of it in our house. I love the fact that it is sugar free, yet doesn't taste like fake sugar.
--------------------
Crystal Light is pretty much all we drink at our house. I love that it has all of the flavor without all of the sugar. It mixes/dissolves easily into water. Lemonade is a staple at our home because it can be mixed with any other flavor.
--------------------
[product:crystal-light-lemonade-drink-mix] This. Right. Here. Is my childhood. My mother was a HUGE fan of Crystal Light lemonade! We always had a full jug in our fridge. It was one of my chores to actually refill the jug with new crystal light lol but I digress. This stuff is the bees knees and I'm adding it to my shopping list right now!!
--------------------
The lemonade Crystal Light is my number one pick! I love lemonade, there’s always a pitcher of this in my fridge!
--------------------
I like to make a pitcher of this and add strawberries it’s so good and so easy for parties
--------------------
I have enjoyed your Crystal Light products for several years. However it seems you keep getting rid of the best flavors and this usually happens when a new "Flavored Tea" comes out. Not all people are tea lovers and we liked these flavors. Flavors include: Lemon Lime, the green one from years ago; Ruby Red Grapefruit, another old flavor; Newer flavors include: Cherry Limeade; and Cherry Pomegranate. Who chooses which flavors get deleted and which get saved. I wish these old flavors could come back and if you must get rid of some how about Fruit Punch and Grape.
--------------------
Opened a brand new tube of powdered drink mix and all the packets were rock hard. Best by date of 10May2020.
--------------------
My favorite summer drink. I love this drink mix. It reminds me of summer and I love the balance between the sweet of the sugar and the sour of the lemon. It is great. Love love love. I highly recommend this product
--------------------
My family and I have been huge fans of Crystal Light Peach Ice Tea for years.... and then they changed the recipe. Now it's "made with Black Tea" and is not very good at all. The actual flavor varies from package to package and from bad to worse. I wonder if Kraft ever heard of the success Coke had in changing their recipe?
--------------------
I stopped drinking carbonated beverages about 6 years ago and Crystal Light has become one of main replacements. I really like this drink but I'm bored. I need new flavors, adult flavors. Pineapple would be great, Watermelon, a fusion of different flavors. Passion fruit. I loved the Mojito you had a couple years ago, a mint tea would be nice. Please give us more variety?
--------------------
Great Stuff, I am a recent kidney transplant patient and need to control my electrolytes, especially potassium. Can you tell me how much potassium is in the lemonade and orange flavor Crystal Light?
--------------------
I have a secret recipe combining diffrent flavors of Crystal Light that everytime I place a pitcher on the table it does'nt last!!! Even with the experienced Crystal Light lovers or the sugar free haters. I'm always asked to contact you because is a hit in all parties and they would like to drink at home.
--------------------
Mo Mo Mojito! I love your Mojito flavored Crystal Light! It was great in cocktails and a delicious combined with Peach Tea! I am trying to replicate it but there is no substitute!! Please bring it back! MO MO MOJITO!!!
--------------------
great taste. mixes better than generic brands. good price. fast delivery.
--------------------
What happened to their best flavor??? Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink? This was by far the best powdered mix made by anyone and they discontinued it? too bad. the others are good but nothing was like that. BRING IT BACK...please!!!
--------------------
Great value and great taset
--------------------
Really enjoy the flavor. I pour a big (24oz) glass and it's gone before I even notice. Smooth and tasty! I'm constantly making another pitcher! BUT....why does it leave a white residue in the clear pitcher and clear glass. Like there are undissolved solids in the mix and you really should scrub the pitcher after each use. What's with that? Not too 'crystal'. Comes off easily but does not rinse off.
--------------------
I LOVE Crystal Light and buy it in all forms...it's my go-to beverage whenever I need a refreshing drink.
--------------------
Anything fruit punch is A+ with me, ok? Must I say anything more? Quenches my thirst. Tastes great. I love fruit punch. :)
--------------------
I get so bored drinking plain old water everyday. I love these crystal light flavors to bring so me excitement to my hydration. I drink so much more water when I use one or two of these a day. Plus they are so good and tasty! The whole family loves them.
--------------------
I love the on the go drink mixed from this brand. Theyre so flavorful and they definitely get me drinking more water than I would if it was just plain. I also love that I dont have to make a giant container all at once
--------------------
I actually love these fruit punch packets. They have a great flavor, although i usually only add half of the packet because they are very potent
--------------------
I like these a lot. Its not a thick or overpowering flavoring like some drink mixes have. The flavor is light and watery which I prefer.
--------------------
Kids like the sickle packs they can just add to water and they have a drink. Better than having soda or sugary juice.
--------------------
These are super affordable, very quick and super easy to use!! But they do have that slightly aspartame flavor to them.
--------------------
This is a family staple when we have group gatherings. It is a favorite among the older and younger people. The flavor is great and is comparable to kool aid without all the sugar/ calories. It is my second favorite crystal light flavor.
--------------------
I have been drinking this since I was a child and it brings back such fond memories of sitting outside on a hot summer day watching my dad do yard work. At this point I dont know what I like more, the refreshing taste or the nostalgia that comes along with it
--------------------
These work for when youre craving juice or a sweet drink but you dont want the calories. Good flow or and they mix in well.
--------------------
Very sweet. Just know if youre going to use this then you will need to water it down a bit more than what it says. If you dont then it will be very tangy and sweet, almost bitter
--------------------
These are my favorite water enhancers and I always carry some in my purse with me. The price is right a d the flavor packs a punch
--------------------
Always delicious! These packets are easy to use and taste great. Makes daily water consumption so much more tasty! Fruit punch is my favorite flavor. Highly recommend!
--------------------
We make a gallon of this a week at home. The kids love it and its easy and cheap to use
--------------------
The best crystal light flavor ever! This is the only one that Ill purchase and it has really great flavor! I wouldnt change this product at all.
--------------------
These were awful. They mixed up nicely but the taste was terrible. I gave them away. It wasn't worth the money I spent on them.
--------------------
This tastes so good! It is just like Kool-Aid fruit punch! Except, no sugar. It has a strong punch flavor and I like using it as a mixer or just over a bunch of ice on a hot day. Very refreshing!
--------------------
I think this is the best flavor of Crystal light and I love using it because it helps me drink water more
--------------------
I really don't like these at all. It's has a horrible after taste. I think because of the substitute sugars used. I'd rather drink water or the fruit punch. Def not this.
--------------------
I absolutely love the crystal light brand this is one of their very many flavors and my husband love it not just cause of flavor but it is very affordable and helps us drink a lot more water than we would ever thinking of drinking without the flavoring these flavoring packets have changed our lives!I would recommend to someone that can't drink water bland
--------------------
Super yummy and super convenient. This is also really versatile. I use it with plain water, as a slushy blended up, with soda water, and even vodka when the time is right. Amazing flavor for a sugar free drink. I will keep buying this, it’s great for a pick me up without downing a ton of calories!
--------------------
Crystal Light Fruit Punch On-The-Go packets and [product:crystal-light-fruit-punch-powdered-drink-mix-caffeine-free-204-oz-can] cannot be beat in the flavor category. All flavors are excellent and I like that they are sugar-free. These are nice too in that if you do not feel like having a carbonated beverage, Crystal Light powders are another alternative for you. Just pick a flavor!
--------------------
This is my favorite Crystal Light flavor. I do not drink any other flavors now that I have found it. I now have others in my family hooked as well.
--------------------
This product tastes good, and it is really nice to use as a way to spice up regular water. However, it is more expensive than the generic brand, and I don’t like it as much. I normally like to use a single packet for multiple cups of water (it’s pretty concentrated if you use the entire pack, I think), but that is really difficult with these because once you open them, the powder will stick together and be super difficult to get out and then dissolve. Overall, fine, but just not the best for how I prefer to use these flavor packet products.
--------------------
I always have a pitcher of this in the fridge. Its great for maintaining weight because its sweet and feel like I'm not depriving myself. Its also great for when I get tired of plain water. My children also love this flavor and I don't feel like him just loading them up on sugary drinks when they drink this.
--------------------
Good if you want low calorie fruit punch. It doesn’t taste exactly like real fruit punch but it’s good. The only thing is that it will clump in your drink a bit if you don’t shake it.
--------------------
It tastes good, but it could taste a bit more like fruit punch. The price is good thought.
--------------------
I like this as an alternative to a sugary drink. It actually tastes good when it’s cold. The only thing is it makes my acid reflux/heartburn go crazy. I’m not sure why. I have to stick to pretty much tea or water.
--------------------
This is my go to crystal light flavor when I get tired of drinking plain water. It taste just like regular fruit punch. The little packets are small, so they can easily fit into your pocket.
--------------------
This stuff is so good to use as a mixer or savior during a hangover! I like to use it as a healthier alternative to a mixer with alcoholic beverages!
--------------------
These are great for summer! I always take them on picnics because bottled water is easier to transport than a gallon of fruit punch.
--------------------
Love love love crystal light especially fruit punch! It is my favorite flavor and helps me get my water intake in. I typically use one packet in 32 ounces and it is still sweet. I think if I had a smaller water bottle I would use half the packet.
--------------------
Only thing I would drink during pregnancy. Taste amazing and it’s affordable. I highly recommend
--------------------
I love fruit punch and crystal light only has 5 calories makes it even better. I also like it because it helps me drink water without actually drinking straight water.
--------------------
Perfect fruit punch for a sunny day. Classic flavor. Tastes better than koolAid. I don’t think theres abything to@be improved here. Not bad price wise but you could probably find an offbrand. I would recommend.
--------------------
In the beginning it tastes really good. I used to drink it all the time but I don’t know if it was altered or I just got used to it but it tastes like chemicals after awhile so I stopped buying it
--------------------
A family favorite of ours! Super yummy and easy to toss in the lunch box to make water better and easier to stay hydrated!
--------------------
Nice for on the go drinks to add to water. It is nice when your child wants something other than milk or water. No sugar and only 5 calories. Would recommend this product. It takes a little bit to dissolve in a bottle of water but eventually does. Great taste and worth the price.
--------------------
My kids are literally obsessed with this stuff and I have no guilt about letting them have it because it’s not loaded with sugar! Win win for everyone. Tastes great and it’s cheap!
--------------------
On of the few ways I can get myself to drink more liquids than soft drinks. I have been drinking these for years. Since my kids were in school. They even preferred these over kool aid themselves. Think more parents should try them as an alternative as the sugar content is less.
--------------------
Can’t go wrong with crystal light they have so many flavors to chose from I like there fruit punch ! Taste good and for the price
--------------------
I love these and the lemonade ones. You can buy a package of the packets for only a few dollars. Flavorful and tangy without being too sweet. You can also buy them online. Perfect for sports and easy to use. They are super convenient because you can easily take them with you for an instant drink fix.
--------------------
Great price and product. You get a tasty drink with no carbs or sugar, can’t beat that.
--------------------
Full of pure fruit taste without the taste of the fake sugary taste! Been drinking this for 30 years and absolutely love this still as a kid and now as an adult an mom and don’t feel guilty letting my 8 yr old drink this especially with all those sugary drinks out there!
--------------------
I have been drinking crystal light since my gastric bypass 14 years ago. It doesnt seem like I am dri king water. I really enjoy the flavor and fruit punch is my favorite.
--------------------
Needless to say, these are the reason I am able to drink so much water! They are pricier but the price it well worth it for me!
--------------------
I always have one of these packets of fruit punch in my purse. I swear by this product, me and my husband and my children love it!
--------------------
I enjoy the fruitier drink option without all the calories and sugar. It’s definitely a go-to.
--------------------
This doesn’t taste like a mixed drink! It’s very refreshing and sweet! It’s a healthier option, too!
--------------------
This is a great substitute for soda and a better way to enjoy water. I keep these in my bag so when I'm out and soda and juice are the main options, I go for bottled water and add my own flavor. The price point is great as well!
--------------------
I am not at all a fruit punch gal but this is my favorite CL flavor. Plenty of flavor although it’s so strong it can make you thirsty if that makes sense. I no longer drink this because of the aspartame. Wish they made it with a better “for you” sweetener
--------------------
i love this flavor! i always have some in my purse for when i’m on the go and want a drink with no added sugar or extra calories!
--------------------
I didn’t like this flavor at all. I usually get these packets to add to water bottles but it didn’t fully dissolve in the water so it was grainy as well
--------------------
Crystal light fruit punch is THE GOAT of all crystal light flavors!!!! This helps me take in so much more water and allows me to have a delicious drink alternative to regular water without the sugar.
--------------------
Love this. Sugar free and is delicious. I put some real lemon juice in it and it makes it so much better
--------------------
Love this drink mix. Usually only drink water but when I want something different I go to Crystal Light.
--------------------
My all time favorite drink! I was placed on a no sugar diet and needed something other than water and came across this in a hospital setting of all places! Now it’s the only thing I will drink! I tried alternative fruit punch drinks that have no sugar and none come close to the taste of crystal light! The convenience of having these packets in my purse makes maintaining my sugar free lifestyle so simple! Just get a bottle of water pour it in, shake it up and enjoy! Even my soda drinking teens enjoy it! Nice alternative to sugary drinks with a great taste!!!!
--------------------
I like this. This helps when I want something else besides water but not the extra calories.
--------------------
My kids love crystal light better then any other drink not as much sugar and it tastes better then kool aid
--------------------
I love the taste of this...it’s just like red Kool Aid I loved as a kid. However, even if I overly dilute it, it still gives me terrible stomach aches! Never had that happen with any other variety.
--------------------
These packets are my favorite! I drink bottled water during the week at work and I always use this mix. It is the only one I've tried that doesn't seem gritty to me. I can't even tell it's sugar free. So yummy.
--------------------
I really like this flavor, it’s probably one of my favorites. My only complaint about crystal light is that it tends to be a little more expensive than other brands
--------------------
Many don't like water so this will add a great flavor. I've only gotten this one time and it was good when I used it. I would get one with low sugar because this can be a little sweet.
--------------------
I enjoy these on-the-go drink packets from Crystal Light. They have great flavor, I just wish they were a tad bit sweeter as sometimes the powder can come off as bitter. These are good for 16 oz plus but any less than that amount and it will be a very strong flavor.
--------------------
I have difficulty drinking water and this is the perfect invention ever introduced to the market specially for people like me. It did more than meet my expectations. Will recommend it. It is tasty and easy to mix
--------------------
I don't like this stuff at all but my boyfriend does he drinks it in place of koolaid. The flavor is too strong for me and it leaves a weird taste in my mouth. Packaged well and priced fairly.
--------------------
I buy Crystal light drink mix in bulk. I buy all the different flavors but my personal favorite is the fruit punch.
--------------------
Affordable and taste so so so good. Refreshing ! Definitely must have. Affordable and good for traveling
--------------------
My house is stocked with these! I love adding it to bottles of water to take on road trips or when we go on walks! Also super refreshing to have when eating at home!
--------------------
So yummy! It taste just like fruit punch and has zero sugar which is great! It is a reasonable price and these usually last me a while since I do not drink them every day.
--------------------
We have this flavor of chystal light in our home at all times! Great mixed with water or 7up!
--------------------
This is the only Crystal Light drink mix I like. The others tastes powdery. This is the only flavor that has a good taste
--------------------
[product:crystal-light-on-the-go-fruit-punch-drink-mix] is my favorite sugar-free drink. The taste is excellent and it doesn't have a weird taste at all. I like the convenient single packets that you just pour into your water bottle and shake it up. :)
--------------------
I really enjoy crystal light I like the fact that these little pouches can be thrown in a bag to make it easy to transport fruit punch is not my favorite flavor it seems a little too artificial for me
--------------------
These are my absolute favorite! We are a no sugar house and these are a great treat for everyone!
--------------------
Love these!! They taste so good and are so easy to use. They help with Weight loss as well without drinking all of the sugar.
--------------------
I use this in place of soda most of the time. It's help lower my blood sugar, and keep myself hydrated. I have a hard time drinking straight water, so this helps
--------------------
This great when you want more than a water flavor! Helps with cravings a sugar drink
--------------------
Crystal Light on the go Punch Drink Mix is a decent product. It was just a little bit tart for my taste,if they would make it just a bit smoother it would be great!! Other products I have noticed don't have that tart taste. No I would not recommend it to others.
--------------------
I love fruit punch but it’s usually too sweet. Not though with crystal light. The flavor balance is great
--------------------
I love these. You can make many drinks with them and mix them with a lot to make different flavors
--------------------
This is my go to fruit punch drink mix. I like it when I’m wanting something other than water. What I don’t like about it is that it’s really sweet if I use a whole package. And I can’t just use half a package because the powder solidified if I don’t use it all.
--------------------
Tasty and healthier alternative to sugar filled drinks. Doesn’t leave an artificial sweetener aftertaste. Great price. Easy to store and carry on the go
--------------------
My favorite on-the-go drink mix! I keep it in my purse, my desk, and in my home! Delicious and helps me stay hydrated
--------------------
I'm an addict to these packets. I make sure to take them wherever I go. I find myself drinking water more because of this product. They have several flavors that I enjoy,but fruit punch is my favorite. I highly recommend purchasing if you find yourself having difficulty drinking water.
--------------------
Love the taste and convenience of on the go packs. A little spendy but worth it for the flavor and low calories. You can put it in your water bottle for on the go or use four to make a gallon (which is what I do).
--------------------
This is my favorite and pretty much the only one I will drink .. one day I will drink water without it maybe lol
--------------------
This is a great option for those who are taking care of their diet and avoiding the consumption of sugar. In my case it is hard for me to drink water and I always look for flavored liquids and this is the perfect option
--------------------
i can’t live without this flavor when i’m on a diet! as a pro tip i like to mix it with a sparkling water for a soda like drink!
--------------------
Just the right flavor, added to a bottle of water, and you have a delicious drink to keep you hydrated!! Without guilt!
--------------------
I drink this all the time. It’s the best flavor. It literally taste like real fruit punch!
--------------------
Great taste. I put a single serving package in my water bottle. Been, drinking this for years. Great alternative for replacing soda pop
--------------------
Would definitely recommend this product! It tastes super good and instead of grabbing a soda I can pour this into my water to meet my craving!
--------------------
I love all flavors but this one is one of my favorites! So easy to keep in your purse for on the go
--------------------
Fruit punch is my favorite. It does have a lot of sugar but it tastes great and it’s better than drinking soda all the time. It’s the perfect drink that goes with anything you eat. All the flavors are pretty good but this is my all time favorite.
--------------------
I love these Crystal Light drink mixes especially the fruit punch flavor. Of course nothing is better than drinking plain water, but I add a packet of this when I want a little flavor.
--------------------
Tastes great. Easy to use, dissolves in water bottles quickly. Pack it in your bag and take it to go.
--------------------
We like the Crystal light fruit punch drink mix. We have it all the time at my house. It is in my cabinet right now. I would recommend this to other people. It is affordable. It is in my fridge right now.
--------------------
I’ve always enjoyed crystal light because it’s fast and easy to use when in a rush and have to go somewhere
--------------------
I try to drink as much water as I can and these flavorings really help my grave for a sugary drink! Awesome flavor!
--------------------
This is my go-to lemonade flavor with the greatest lemonade brand out there! I highly recommend!
--------------------
Crystal Light powders are so easy to use and there's so many good flavors! I haven't tried one that I didn't like. Personally I prefer the powder packets to the little liquid shooter things. I like that its pre-measured so you just have to add to water and you get the perfect amount of flavor
--------------------
All crystal light flavors, Especially the raspberry, are light yet full of flavor! And the part better than the flavor? Its the piece of mind knowing im not drinking a ton of sugar or who knows wats in my beverage!! Crystal light is an all around favorite!!
--------------------
Love raspberry lemonade and the fact that you get to enjoy this even on the go! These convenient packets makes it easy to enjoy anywhere life takes you! I definitely recommend this. I buy this time and time again.
--------------------
Crystal light is a great tasting choice when I want something more than just water. I can make a lot for little money
--------------------
At one point, this was the only way I would consume enough water throughout the day. Its definitely sweeter and slightly tangier than other drink mixes.
--------------------
I really enjoy this flavor of crystal light. I like the raspberry option more than strawberry. It is light, on the sweet side but is perfect on a summer day! I would recommend this to those that like flavored lemonade.
--------------------
I love Crystal Light's Raspberry lemonade! This is definitely my favorite flavor. It is super easy to make and tastes really good!
--------------------
I love a twist to my lemonaide once in awhile and Raspberry is my go to Flavor. Refreshing easy on the calories. A diabetics friend. There really isn't much to think about its great and it's portable.
--------------------
I love that I can throw these packets in my purse and add to a bottle or cup of water!!! I also love that they are caffeine free.
--------------------
I used to drink only the plain lemon dare until I found this. Its addicting!!! On a hot day or shoot a cold day too!
--------------------
I love these because its hard for me to get myself to drink water and this make sit taste like juice while i know im still getting hydrated
--------------------
Blah I dont know how people can drink these powdered things. I dont like any of them. Crystal light or any brand of powdered drinks... not my jam. I understand it for those on diets though. Otherwise... naw.
--------------------
I havent drunk this in years, but it was an absolutely delicious go-to several years ago when I was on a more strict diet. The flavor is great in lieu of still water. (I drink more mineral water now.)
--------------------
This helps me reach my daily water intake by giving my water just the right flavor! It also helps me drink alcohol very efficiently because it is great to mix with vodka water to make it more flavorful! Would recommend!
--------------------
Love love love this mix!! The taste is so good!! You can't even tell how there is no sugar in this. My stepkids also love this and I love that there is no sugar in it!! I always keep these packets on hand. They're so convenient!!
--------------------
Love love love this raspberry lemonade drink mix in. It is so refreshing on a hot day or after a tough workout. It is pretty sweet so I typically add a little more water to balance it out. Reasonably priced
--------------------
Would highly recommend these to others! One of my favorite drink mixes by far. Its easy to just add to water, mix or shake it up, and get going. Good flavor and extremely affordable. Easy to find in stores!
--------------------
Delicious, i make this for the teenage boys and myself it is pretty fantastic. I don't drink carbonated beverages and this is so much better than pop. No sugar is nerd to be added it is plenty sweet just add water. Its wonderful.
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite water flavored thing out there, taste delicious! I mix this into my water at least once a day.
--------------------
This makes plain water taste sooo good! Regular water has always been so blah for me and I hated drinking it. This adds that flavor I want and actually helps me drink a ton more water.
--------------------
I enjoy crytal light, especially when I am just not hitting my water in take for the day. It adds a great flavor, mixes well, and seems to be relatively healthy. There are a lot of flavor options, but this is one of my favorites. I would purchase again and recommend to others.
--------------------
I use this on the to go !!!!!!! It helps to buzz up my energy and limits my caffeine in take since I love green tea and coffee. One Pack is good for one water bottle I enjoy it more on a cold water bottle.
--------------------
I love adding Crystal Light Raspberry Lemonade to my water everyday. I have tried the regular and pink lemonade and sometimes they are too acidic but the Raspberry Lemonade is perfect and tastes wonderful!
--------------------
This are amazing! I love to put this in my water to add that extra flavor and what a bonus is actually healthy for you! The kids enjoy all the flavors that they provide, never any trouble with getting them to drink plenty of water when you have these to add in the mix! The flavors are very tasty and true to description. If you have young kids who dislike to drink water i suggest giving these a try!
--------------------
I like Crystal Light. Its artificial for sure, but it doesnt have a terrible aftertaste and its a good balance of sweet and tangy. Sometimes I like to water it down a little more than the instructions say.
--------------------
I love these crystal light raspberry lemonade powdered drink mix so much! Their packaging are so easy and all you have to do is put it in water and shake it. It has great flavor and I would recommend this!
--------------------
I wanted to try this because I heard so much about it and I’ve been drinking pretty much all soda and sugary drinks so I wanted this as a replacement. This is pretty good because it’s not so sweet at all.
--------------------
Crystal Light Raspberry Lemonade is always in our refrigerator.   It's quick and easy to prepare.  In our house it's preferred to plain drinking water.  Target always has it stocked and at the best price.  I usually pour two packets into a 1 gallon jug of water.  It lasts longer that way.  Sometimes the taste of the product can vary.  Not in a bad way, but Kraft should work on making it more consistent.  My family still loves it regardless and it's in my Target cart every week!
--------------------
Why we should buy Crystal Light drink powder and not Pepsi or any other brand of drinks similar to Pepsi.


Crystal Light is a powder fruit flavoring that can be added to water to make a fruit flavored drink. It comes in many flavors with six packs in a box. The cost of the Crystal Light is $2.48 for a box and one large bottle of Pepsi Cola costs $1.78, which is only seventy cents less than Crystal Light.

I like Crystal Light better, because one pack when mixed with water, makes 2 quarts of drink. One 2 L bottle of Pepsi Cola is 2.1 quarts, which is only seventy cents less than Crystal Light, but there are six packs in a box so the total is 12 quarts.

Crystal Light has 5 calories in one serving. One serving is equal to 1/8 of a packet. Because  one packet makes 2 quarts, there are 8 drinks in a packet when mixed with wader or 48 servings per container. There are 0 mg of Sodium, 0 g of Fat, 0 g of Carbohydrate, 0 g Sugar and 0 of Protein.

Pepsi has 150 calories in one serving of 12 ounces. There are "about" 6 servings per container, with 0 mg of Fat, 30 mg of Sodium, Carbohydrates 41 g and 0 g of Protein.

I recommend people to buy Crystal Light because it has no Carbohydrates or Sugars in it and it is better for you health. It also has many different flavors.
--------------------
I love this particular flavor and drink it all the time. However, I have noticed a recent taste change. Has Kraft recently changed the ingredients? I don't care for the taste change; it tastes fruitier.
--------------------
I have enjoyed your Crystal Light products for several years. However it seems you keep getting rid of the best flavors and this usually happens when a new "Flavored Tea" comes out. Not all people are tea lovers and we liked these flavors. Flavors include: Lemon Lime, the green one from years ago; Ruby Red Grapefruit, another old flavor; Newer flavors include: Cherry Limeade; and Cherry Pomegranate. Who chooses which flavors get deleted and which get saved. I wish these old flavors could come back and if you must get rid of some how about Fruit Punch and Grape.
--------------------
Opened a brand new tube of powdered drink mix and all the packets were rock hard. Best by date of 10May2020.
--------------------
This is a great alternative for me other than drinking soda or water or juice. It has such a nice flavor without as many calories.
--------------------
My family and I have been huge fans of Crystal Light Peach Ice Tea for years.... and then they changed the recipe. Now it's "made with Black Tea" and is not very good at all. The actual flavor varies from package to package and from bad to worse. I wonder if Kraft ever heard of the success Coke had in changing their recipe?
--------------------
I stopped drinking carbonated beverages about 6 years ago and Crystal Light has become one of main replacements. I really like this drink but I'm bored. I need new flavors, adult flavors. Pineapple would be great, Watermelon, a fusion of different flavors. Passion fruit. I loved the Mojito you had a couple years ago, a mint tea would be nice. Please give us more variety?
--------------------
Great Stuff, I am a recent kidney transplant patient and need to control my electrolytes, especially potassium. Can you tell me how much potassium is in the lemonade and orange flavor Crystal Light?
--------------------
I have a secret recipe combining diffrent flavors of Crystal Light that everytime I place a pitcher on the table it does'nt last!!! Even with the experienced Crystal Light lovers or the sugar free haters. I'm always asked to contact you because is a hit in all parties and they would like to drink at home.
--------------------
Mo Mo Mojito! I love your Mojito flavored Crystal Light! It was great in cocktails and a delicious combined with Peach Tea! I am trying to replicate it but there is no substitute!! Please bring it back! MO MO MOJITO!!!
--------------------
I really like this flavor. My only problem was that when I opened the container that had the envelopes of the drink mix , the drink mix was all in the container; the drink mix seeped out of the envelopes it was in. It tasted great, but it was really strong since it was harder to measure out when it's not in that envelope. Great price, & I also realize things like this happens now & then.
--------------------
Great drink, so much cheaper than buying at my local grocery
--------------------
What happened to their best flavor??? Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink? This was by far the best powdered mix made by anyone and they discontinued it? too bad. the others are good but nothing was like that. BRING IT BACK...please!!!
--------------------
Really enjoy the flavor. I pour a big (24oz) glass and it's gone before I even notice. Smooth and tasty! I'm constantly making another pitcher! BUT....why does it leave a white residue in the clear pitcher and clear glass. Like there are undissolved solids in the mix and you really should scrub the pitcher after each use. What's with that? Not too 'crystal'. Comes off easily but does not rinse off.
--------------------
I like taking this work everyday. I can have something with more flavor than just water but without the guilt of sugar, calories, and salt of other beverages. This is the flavor I like best.
--------------------
Absolutely my favorite drink! So good. My whole family loves it. I've even got my sisters family drinking it. She has nearly given up soda. Thank you so much!!
--------------------
I absolutely love Crystal Light raspberry iced tea. However, the only place that I can buy it around me is Target. . I have brought it into all of the grocery stores around me and Walmart also. They say that it is not available for them to order. Why is that? And whenever I go to Target to try and buy it they are Always very low on it as they are the only ones who carry it around here. It's very annoying. .
--------------------
My family could not keep enough of the Raspberry Tea in the fridge all year, and we live in northern MN. I even bought it to put in my adult kids Christmas stockings. But you have changed it, and it has an after taste. My kids were here yesterday, and neither one even touched it. PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK! Then I would give you a 5 star rating. I would much rather drink Crystal Light than anything else.

I have Target ship a few every month. They come fast and are less expensive then other places.
--------------------
What happened to their best flavor??? Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink? This was by far the best powdered mix made by anyone and they discontinued it? too bad. the others are good but nothing was like that. BRING IT BACK...please!!!
--------------------
This is the best ice tea ever! It has a wonderful flavor to it and it is the most popular drink in our house.
--------------------
I thought they'd discontinued this flavor, but stumbled on it at target! Please don't stop carrying this flavor!!! Thanks! :)
--------------------
Really enjoy the flavor. I pour a big (24oz) glass and it's gone before I even notice. Smooth and tasty! I'm constantly making another pitcher! BUT....why does it leave a white residue in the clear pitcher and clear glass. Like there are undissolved solids in the mix and you really should scrub the pitcher after each use. What's with that?

--------------------
Great flavor, expensive but deals available through Target and other stores sometimes so that's when we stock up.
--------------------
I have tried almost all the flavors and I like this one the best. I drink at least 3 quarts of this each day. Wish I could buy in bulk. Also, this is hard for me to find in stores.
--------------------
This is a fabulous flavor. My favorite by far. Sweet and flavorful! Buy it all the time!
--------------------
I do enjoy the flavor and drink one sleeve packet daily. It is quite quenching where I live. My problem is availability. I often have to drive 160 miles to get it and then the hunt is on to find it at the chain stores. I would order if I could by the case. Any suggestions I can afford?
--------------------
I have been looking for this flavor for a month. It's no longer available in the state of Oregon. Please don't discontinue!
--------------------
I drove 40 minutes to get one container because it’s no where to be found and it’s my favorite drink. I go thru a packet a day. Why is it suddenly unavailable everywhere?
--------------------
My friends and I are going nuts! What are we supposed to drink our vodka with? If I knew this would be a Covid casualty I would have stocked the bunker! Please come back!
--------------------
I am worried that this is being discontinued?? It is out of stock in most stores.
--------------------
My absolute favorite drink.  Been drinking for years.  I buy the entire shelf out when I find it.  The problem is it appears no one has it in stock.  Is this just temporary?  Or permanent.  If permanent I'm deeply saddened and I hope a generic makes it.

Also makes a great drink mixer with vodka ;-)
--------------------
We love this tea. We have a 1 gallon pitcher that my husband makes this tea in and its seems like he makes 3 or 4 times a week. We had so many packages of this, I opened them all and bought a plastic bin to put all the envelopes. Sadly, we can no longer find this flavor. The product locator only tells us its out of stock. I figured that out by looking at the empty shelf. Managers can't seem to give us an actual date of when more will be in.

--------------------
This drink mix has become a staple around my house. I do confess I like to spruce it up a bit. Instead of water, I use brewed green tea I make myself. I also mix that with low sugar versions of fruit juices like blueberry, mango, pomegranate, and others. It always turns out great (well almost always) plus nice and cold on a hot day. Plus, it makes keeping your body well hydrated pretty easy. I recommend it. Couldn't do without it.
--------------------

--------------------
my favorite of all the crystal light teas plus green tea benefits.
--------------------
Anything fruit punch is A+ with me, ok? Must I say anything more? Quenches my thirst. Tastes great. I love fruit punch. :)
--------------------
I get so bored drinking plain old water everyday. I love these crystal light flavors to bring so me excitement to my hydration. I drink so much more water when I use one or two of these a day. Plus they are so good and tasty! The whole family loves them.
--------------------
I love the on the go drink mixed from this brand. Theyre so flavorful and they definitely get me drinking more water than I would if it was just plain. I also love that I dont have to make a giant container all at once
--------------------
I actually love these fruit punch packets. They have a great flavor, although i usually only add half of the packet because they are very potent
--------------------
I like these a lot. Its not a thick or overpowering flavoring like some drink mixes have. The flavor is light and watery which I prefer.
--------------------
Kids like the sickle packs they can just add to water and they have a drink. Better than having soda or sugary juice.
--------------------
These are super affordable, very quick and super easy to use!! But they do have that slightly aspartame flavor to them.
--------------------
This is a family staple when we have group gatherings. It is a favorite among the older and younger people. The flavor is great and is comparable to kool aid without all the sugar/ calories. It is my second favorite crystal light flavor.
--------------------
I have been drinking this since I was a child and it brings back such fond memories of sitting outside on a hot summer day watching my dad do yard work. At this point I dont know what I like more, the refreshing taste or the nostalgia that comes along with it
--------------------
These work for when youre craving juice or a sweet drink but you dont want the calories. Good flow or and they mix in well.
--------------------
Very sweet. Just know if youre going to use this then you will need to water it down a bit more than what it says. If you dont then it will be very tangy and sweet, almost bitter
--------------------
These are my favorite water enhancers and I always carry some in my purse with me. The price is right a d the flavor packs a punch
--------------------
Always delicious! These packets are easy to use and taste great. Makes daily water consumption so much more tasty! Fruit punch is my favorite flavor. Highly recommend!
--------------------
We make a gallon of this a week at home. The kids love it and its easy and cheap to use
--------------------
The best crystal light flavor ever! This is the only one that Ill purchase and it has really great flavor! I wouldnt change this product at all.
--------------------
These were awful. They mixed up nicely but the taste was terrible. I gave them away. It wasn't worth the money I spent on them.
--------------------
This tastes so good! It is just like Kool-Aid fruit punch! Except, no sugar. It has a strong punch flavor and I like using it as a mixer or just over a bunch of ice on a hot day. Very refreshing!
--------------------
I think this is the best flavor of Crystal light and I love using it because it helps me drink water more
--------------------
I really don't like these at all. It's has a horrible after taste. I think because of the substitute sugars used. I'd rather drink water or the fruit punch. Def not this.
--------------------
I absolutely love the crystal light brand this is one of their very many flavors and my husband love it not just cause of flavor but it is very affordable and helps us drink a lot more water than we would ever thinking of drinking without the flavoring these flavoring packets have changed our lives!I would recommend to someone that can't drink water bland
--------------------
Super yummy and super convenient. This is also really versatile. I use it with plain water, as a slushy blended up, with soda water, and even vodka when the time is right. Amazing flavor for a sugar free drink. I will keep buying this, it’s great for a pick me up without downing a ton of calories!
--------------------
Crystal Light Fruit Punch On-The-Go packets and [product:crystal-light-fruit-punch-powdered-drink-mix-caffeine-free-204-oz-can] cannot be beat in the flavor category. All flavors are excellent and I like that they are sugar-free. These are nice too in that if you do not feel like having a carbonated beverage, Crystal Light powders are another alternative for you. Just pick a flavor!
--------------------
This is my favorite Crystal Light flavor. I do not drink any other flavors now that I have found it. I now have others in my family hooked as well.
--------------------
This product tastes good, and it is really nice to use as a way to spice up regular water. However, it is more expensive than the generic brand, and I don’t like it as much. I normally like to use a single packet for multiple cups of water (it’s pretty concentrated if you use the entire pack, I think), but that is really difficult with these because once you open them, the powder will stick together and be super difficult to get out and then dissolve. Overall, fine, but just not the best for how I prefer to use these flavor packet products.
--------------------
I always have a pitcher of this in the fridge. Its great for maintaining weight because its sweet and feel like I'm not depriving myself. Its also great for when I get tired of plain water. My children also love this flavor and I don't feel like him just loading them up on sugary drinks when they drink this.
--------------------
Good if you want low calorie fruit punch. It doesn’t taste exactly like real fruit punch but it’s good. The only thing is that it will clump in your drink a bit if you don’t shake it.
--------------------
It tastes good, but it could taste a bit more like fruit punch. The price is good thought.
--------------------
I like this as an alternative to a sugary drink. It actually tastes good when it’s cold. The only thing is it makes my acid reflux/heartburn go crazy. I’m not sure why. I have to stick to pretty much tea or water.
--------------------
This is my go to crystal light flavor when I get tired of drinking plain water. It taste just like regular fruit punch. The little packets are small, so they can easily fit into your pocket.
--------------------
This stuff is so good to use as a mixer or savior during a hangover! I like to use it as a healthier alternative to a mixer with alcoholic beverages!
--------------------
These are great for summer! I always take them on picnics because bottled water is easier to transport than a gallon of fruit punch.
--------------------
Love love love crystal light especially fruit punch! It is my favorite flavor and helps me get my water intake in. I typically use one packet in 32 ounces and it is still sweet. I think if I had a smaller water bottle I would use half the packet.
--------------------
Only thing I would drink during pregnancy. Taste amazing and it’s affordable. I highly recommend
--------------------
I love fruit punch and crystal light only has 5 calories makes it even better. I also like it because it helps me drink water without actually drinking straight water.
--------------------
Perfect fruit punch for a sunny day. Classic flavor. Tastes better than koolAid. I don’t think theres abything to@be improved here. Not bad price wise but you could probably find an offbrand. I would recommend.
--------------------
In the beginning it tastes really good. I used to drink it all the time but I don’t know if it was altered or I just got used to it but it tastes like chemicals after awhile so I stopped buying it
--------------------
A family favorite of ours! Super yummy and easy to toss in the lunch box to make water better and easier to stay hydrated!
--------------------
Nice for on the go drinks to add to water. It is nice when your child wants something other than milk or water. No sugar and only 5 calories. Would recommend this product. It takes a little bit to dissolve in a bottle of water but eventually does. Great taste and worth the price.
--------------------
My kids are literally obsessed with this stuff and I have no guilt about letting them have it because it’s not loaded with sugar! Win win for everyone. Tastes great and it’s cheap!
--------------------
On of the few ways I can get myself to drink more liquids than soft drinks. I have been drinking these for years. Since my kids were in school. They even preferred these over kool aid themselves. Think more parents should try them as an alternative as the sugar content is less.
--------------------
Can’t go wrong with crystal light they have so many flavors to chose from I like there fruit punch ! Taste good and for the price
--------------------
I love these and the lemonade ones. You can buy a package of the packets for only a few dollars. Flavorful and tangy without being too sweet. You can also buy them online. Perfect for sports and easy to use. They are super convenient because you can easily take them with you for an instant drink fix.
--------------------
Great price and product. You get a tasty drink with no carbs or sugar, can’t beat that.
--------------------
Full of pure fruit taste without the taste of the fake sugary taste! Been drinking this for 30 years and absolutely love this still as a kid and now as an adult an mom and don’t feel guilty letting my 8 yr old drink this especially with all those sugary drinks out there!
--------------------
I have been drinking crystal light since my gastric bypass 14 years ago. It doesnt seem like I am dri king water. I really enjoy the flavor and fruit punch is my favorite.
--------------------
Needless to say, these are the reason I am able to drink so much water! They are pricier but the price it well worth it for me!
--------------------
I always have one of these packets of fruit punch in my purse. I swear by this product, me and my husband and my children love it!
--------------------
I enjoy the fruitier drink option without all the calories and sugar. It’s definitely a go-to.
--------------------
This doesn’t taste like a mixed drink! It’s very refreshing and sweet! It’s a healthier option, too!
--------------------
This is a great substitute for soda and a better way to enjoy water. I keep these in my bag so when I'm out and soda and juice are the main options, I go for bottled water and add my own flavor. The price point is great as well!
--------------------
I am not at all a fruit punch gal but this is my favorite CL flavor. Plenty of flavor although it’s so strong it can make you thirsty if that makes sense. I no longer drink this because of the aspartame. Wish they made it with a better “for you” sweetener
--------------------
i love this flavor! i always have some in my purse for when i’m on the go and want a drink with no added sugar or extra calories!
--------------------
I didn’t like this flavor at all. I usually get these packets to add to water bottles but it didn’t fully dissolve in the water so it was grainy as well
--------------------
Crystal light fruit punch is THE GOAT of all crystal light flavors!!!! This helps me take in so much more water and allows me to have a delicious drink alternative to regular water without the sugar.
--------------------
Love this. Sugar free and is delicious. I put some real lemon juice in it and it makes it so much better
--------------------
Love this drink mix. Usually only drink water but when I want something different I go to Crystal Light.
--------------------
My all time favorite drink! I was placed on a no sugar diet and needed something other than water and came across this in a hospital setting of all places! Now it’s the only thing I will drink! I tried alternative fruit punch drinks that have no sugar and none come close to the taste of crystal light! The convenience of having these packets in my purse makes maintaining my sugar free lifestyle so simple! Just get a bottle of water pour it in, shake it up and enjoy! Even my soda drinking teens enjoy it! Nice alternative to sugary drinks with a great taste!!!!
--------------------
I like this. This helps when I want something else besides water but not the extra calories.
--------------------
My kids love crystal light better then any other drink not as much sugar and it tastes better then kool aid
--------------------
I love the taste of this...it’s just like red Kool Aid I loved as a kid. However, even if I overly dilute it, it still gives me terrible stomach aches! Never had that happen with any other variety.
--------------------
These packets are my favorite! I drink bottled water during the week at work and I always use this mix. It is the only one I've tried that doesn't seem gritty to me. I can't even tell it's sugar free. So yummy.
--------------------
I really like this flavor, it’s probably one of my favorites. My only complaint about crystal light is that it tends to be a little more expensive than other brands
--------------------
Many don't like water so this will add a great flavor. I've only gotten this one time and it was good when I used it. I would get one with low sugar because this can be a little sweet.
--------------------
I enjoy these on-the-go drink packets from Crystal Light. They have great flavor, I just wish they were a tad bit sweeter as sometimes the powder can come off as bitter. These are good for 16 oz plus but any less than that amount and it will be a very strong flavor.
--------------------
I have difficulty drinking water and this is the perfect invention ever introduced to the market specially for people like me. It did more than meet my expectations. Will recommend it. It is tasty and easy to mix
--------------------
I don't like this stuff at all but my boyfriend does he drinks it in place of koolaid. The flavor is too strong for me and it leaves a weird taste in my mouth. Packaged well and priced fairly.
--------------------
I buy Crystal light drink mix in bulk. I buy all the different flavors but my personal favorite is the fruit punch.
--------------------
Affordable and taste so so so good. Refreshing ! Definitely must have. Affordable and good for traveling
--------------------
My house is stocked with these! I love adding it to bottles of water to take on road trips or when we go on walks! Also super refreshing to have when eating at home!
--------------------
So yummy! It taste just like fruit punch and has zero sugar which is great! It is a reasonable price and these usually last me a while since I do not drink them every day.
--------------------
We have this flavor of chystal light in our home at all times! Great mixed with water or 7up!
--------------------
This is the only Crystal Light drink mix I like. The others tastes powdery. This is the only flavor that has a good taste
--------------------
[product:crystal-light-on-the-go-fruit-punch-drink-mix] is my favorite sugar-free drink. The taste is excellent and it doesn't have a weird taste at all. I like the convenient single packets that you just pour into your water bottle and shake it up. :)
--------------------
I really enjoy crystal light I like the fact that these little pouches can be thrown in a bag to make it easy to transport fruit punch is not my favorite flavor it seems a little too artificial for me
--------------------
These are my absolute favorite! We are a no sugar house and these are a great treat for everyone!
--------------------
Love these!! They taste so good and are so easy to use. They help with Weight loss as well without drinking all of the sugar.
--------------------
I use this in place of soda most of the time. It's help lower my blood sugar, and keep myself hydrated. I have a hard time drinking straight water, so this helps
--------------------
This great when you want more than a water flavor! Helps with cravings a sugar drink
--------------------
Crystal Light on the go Punch Drink Mix is a decent product. It was just a little bit tart for my taste,if they would make it just a bit smoother it would be great!! Other products I have noticed don't have that tart taste. No I would not recommend it to others.
--------------------
I love fruit punch but it’s usually too sweet. Not though with crystal light. The flavor balance is great
--------------------
I love these. You can make many drinks with them and mix them with a lot to make different flavors
--------------------
This is my go to fruit punch drink mix. I like it when I’m wanting something other than water. What I don’t like about it is that it’s really sweet if I use a whole package. And I can’t just use half a package because the powder solidified if I don’t use it all.
--------------------
Tasty and healthier alternative to sugar filled drinks. Doesn’t leave an artificial sweetener aftertaste. Great price. Easy to store and carry on the go
--------------------
My favorite on-the-go drink mix! I keep it in my purse, my desk, and in my home! Delicious and helps me stay hydrated
--------------------
I'm an addict to these packets. I make sure to take them wherever I go. I find myself drinking water more because of this product. They have several flavors that I enjoy,but fruit punch is my favorite. I highly recommend purchasing if you find yourself having difficulty drinking water.
--------------------
Love the taste and convenience of on the go packs. A little spendy but worth it for the flavor and low calories. You can put it in your water bottle for on the go or use four to make a gallon (which is what I do).
--------------------
This is my favorite and pretty much the only one I will drink .. one day I will drink water without it maybe lol
--------------------
This is a great option for those who are taking care of their diet and avoiding the consumption of sugar. In my case it is hard for me to drink water and I always look for flavored liquids and this is the perfect option
--------------------
i can’t live without this flavor when i’m on a diet! as a pro tip i like to mix it with a sparkling water for a soda like drink!
--------------------
Just the right flavor, added to a bottle of water, and you have a delicious drink to keep you hydrated!! Without guilt!
--------------------
I drink this all the time. It’s the best flavor. It literally taste like real fruit punch!
--------------------
Great taste. I put a single serving package in my water bottle. Been, drinking this for years. Great alternative for replacing soda pop
--------------------
Would definitely recommend this product! It tastes super good and instead of grabbing a soda I can pour this into my water to meet my craving!
--------------------
I love all flavors but this one is one of my favorites! So easy to keep in your purse for on the go
--------------------
Fruit punch is my favorite. It does have a lot of sugar but it tastes great and it’s better than drinking soda all the time. It’s the perfect drink that goes with anything you eat. All the flavors are pretty good but this is my all time favorite.
--------------------
I love these Crystal Light drink mixes especially the fruit punch flavor. Of course nothing is better than drinking plain water, but I add a packet of this when I want a little flavor.
--------------------
Tastes great. Easy to use, dissolves in water bottles quickly. Pack it in your bag and take it to go.
--------------------
We like the Crystal light fruit punch drink mix. We have it all the time at my house. It is in my cabinet right now. I would recommend this to other people. It is affordable. It is in my fridge right now.
--------------------
I’ve always enjoyed crystal light because it’s fast and easy to use when in a rush and have to go somewhere
--------------------
I try to drink as much water as I can and these flavorings really help my grave for a sugary drink! Awesome flavor!
--------------------
This is my go-to lemonade flavor with the greatest lemonade brand out there! I highly recommend!
--------------------
Crystal Light powders are so easy to use and there's so many good flavors! I haven't tried one that I didn't like. Personally I prefer the powder packets to the little liquid shooter things. I like that its pre-measured so you just have to add to water and you get the perfect amount of flavor
--------------------
All crystal light flavors, Especially the raspberry, are light yet full of flavor! And the part better than the flavor? Its the piece of mind knowing im not drinking a ton of sugar or who knows wats in my beverage!! Crystal light is an all around favorite!!
--------------------
Love raspberry lemonade and the fact that you get to enjoy this even on the go! These convenient packets makes it easy to enjoy anywhere life takes you! I definitely recommend this. I buy this time and time again.
--------------------
Crystal light is a great tasting choice when I want something more than just water. I can make a lot for little money
--------------------
At one point, this was the only way I would consume enough water throughout the day. Its definitely sweeter and slightly tangier than other drink mixes.
--------------------
I thought these were pretty good, not overly sweet. I liked them better than the regular lemonade flavor.. They’re also convenient to grab a pack on the go and put it in my purse for later in the day.
--------------------
I really enjoy this flavor of crystal light. I like the raspberry option more than strawberry. It is light, on the sweet side but is perfect on a summer day! I would recommend this to those that like flavored lemonade.
--------------------
I love Crystal Light's Raspberry lemonade! This is definitely my favorite flavor. It is super easy to make and tastes really good!
--------------------
I love a twist to my lemonaide once in awhile and Raspberry is my go to Flavor. Refreshing easy on the calories. A diabetics friend. There really isn't much to think about its great and it's portable.
--------------------
I love that I can throw these packets in my purse and add to a bottle or cup of water!!! I also love that they are caffeine free.
--------------------
I used to drink only the plain lemon dare until I found this. Its addicting!!! On a hot day or shoot a cold day too!
--------------------
I love these because its hard for me to get myself to drink water and this make sit taste like juice while i know im still getting hydrated
--------------------
Blah I dont know how people can drink these powdered things. I dont like any of them. Crystal light or any brand of powdered drinks... not my jam. I understand it for those on diets though. Otherwise... naw.
--------------------
I havent drunk this in years, but it was an absolutely delicious go-to several years ago when I was on a more strict diet. The flavor is great in lieu of still water. (I drink more mineral water now.)
--------------------
This helps me reach my daily water intake by giving my water just the right flavor! It also helps me drink alcohol very efficiently because it is great to mix with vodka water to make it more flavorful! Would recommend!
--------------------
Love love love this mix!! The taste is so good!! You can't even tell how there is no sugar in this. My stepkids also love this and I love that there is no sugar in it!! I always keep these packets on hand. They're so convenient!!
--------------------
Love love love this raspberry lemonade drink mix in. It is so refreshing on a hot day or after a tough workout. It is pretty sweet so I typically add a little more water to balance it out. Reasonably priced
--------------------
Would highly recommend these to others! One of my favorite drink mixes by far. Its easy to just add to water, mix or shake it up, and get going. Good flavor and extremely affordable. Easy to find in stores!
--------------------
Delicious, i make this for the teenage boys and myself it is pretty fantastic. I don't drink carbonated beverages and this is so much better than pop. No sugar is nerd to be added it is plenty sweet just add water. Its wonderful.
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite water flavored thing out there, taste delicious! I mix this into my water at least once a day.
--------------------
This makes plain water taste sooo good! Regular water has always been so blah for me and I hated drinking it. This adds that flavor I want and actually helps me drink a ton more water.
--------------------
I enjoy crytal light, especially when I am just not hitting my water in take for the day. It adds a great flavor, mixes well, and seems to be relatively healthy. There are a lot of flavor options, but this is one of my favorites. I would purchase again and recommend to others.
--------------------
I use this on the to go !!!!!!! It helps to buzz up my energy and limits my caffeine in take since I love green tea and coffee. One Pack is good for one water bottle I enjoy it more on a cold water bottle.
--------------------
I love adding Crystal Light Raspberry Lemonade to my water everyday. I have tried the regular and pink lemonade and sometimes they are too acidic but the Raspberry Lemonade is perfect and tastes wonderful!
--------------------
This are amazing! I love to put this in my water to add that extra flavor and what a bonus is actually healthy for you! The kids enjoy all the flavors that they provide, never any trouble with getting them to drink plenty of water when you have these to add in the mix! The flavors are very tasty and true to description. If you have young kids who dislike to drink water i suggest giving these a try!
--------------------
I like Crystal Light. Its artificial for sure, but it doesnt have a terrible aftertaste and its a good balance of sweet and tangy. Sometimes I like to water it down a little more than the instructions say.
--------------------
I love these crystal light raspberry lemonade powdered drink mix so much! Their packaging are so easy and all you have to do is put it in water and shake it. It has great flavor and I would recommend this!
--------------------
I wanted to try this because I heard so much about it and I’ve been drinking pretty much all soda and sugary drinks so I wanted this as a replacement. This is pretty good because it’s not so sweet at all.
--------------------
I love this particular flavor and drink it all the time. However, I have noticed a recent taste change. Has Kraft recently changed the ingredients? I don't care for the taste change; it tastes fruitier.
--------------------
This flavor is my favorite! Love it! I can seriously drink this everyday all day
--------------------
I have enjoyed your Crystal Light products for several years. However it seems you keep getting rid of the best flavors and this usually happens when a new "Flavored Tea" comes out. Not all people are tea lovers and we liked these flavors. Flavors include: Lemon Lime, the green one from years ago; Ruby Red Grapefruit, another old flavor; Newer flavors include: Cherry Limeade; and Cherry Pomegranate. Who chooses which flavors get deleted and which get saved. I wish these old flavors could come back and if you must get rid of some how about Fruit Punch and Grape.
--------------------
Opened a brand new tube of powdered drink mix and all the packets were rock hard. Best by date of 10May2020.
--------------------
This is a great alternative for me other than drinking soda or water or juice. It has such a nice flavor without as many calories.
--------------------
My family and I have been huge fans of Crystal Light Peach Ice Tea for years.... and then they changed the recipe. Now it's "made with Black Tea" and is not very good at all. The actual flavor varies from package to package and from bad to worse. I wonder if Kraft ever heard of the success Coke had in changing their recipe?
--------------------
I stopped drinking carbonated beverages about 6 years ago and Crystal Light has become one of main replacements. I really like this drink but I'm bored. I need new flavors, adult flavors. Pineapple would be great, Watermelon, a fusion of different flavors. Passion fruit. I loved the Mojito you had a couple years ago, a mint tea would be nice. Please give us more variety?
--------------------
Great Stuff, I am a recent kidney transplant patient and need to control my electrolytes, especially potassium. Can you tell me how much potassium is in the lemonade and orange flavor Crystal Light?
--------------------
I have a secret recipe combining diffrent flavors of Crystal Light that everytime I place a pitcher on the table it does'nt last!!! Even with the experienced Crystal Light lovers or the sugar free haters. I'm always asked to contact you because is a hit in all parties and they would like to drink at home.
--------------------
Mo Mo Mojito! I love your Mojito flavored Crystal Light! It was great in cocktails and a delicious combined with Peach Tea! I am trying to replicate it but there is no substitute!! Please bring it back! MO MO MOJITO!!!
--------------------
What happened to their best flavor??? Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink? This was by far the best powdered mix made by anyone and they discontinued it? too bad. the others are good but nothing was like that. BRING IT BACK...please!!!
--------------------
What a great way to get all the water you need each day. Easy to use and has wonderful flavor.
--------------------
I love this flavor. It is getting harder to fine in my area stores. Wondering where I can by the multipack of the Energy Peach mango on the go packs
--------------------
Really enjoy the flavor. I pour a big (24oz) glass and it's gone before I even notice. Smooth and tasty! I'm constantly making another pitcher! BUT....why does it leave a white residue in the clear pitcher and clear glass. Like there are undissolved solids in the mix and you really should scrub the pitcher after each use. What's with that? Not too 'crystal'. Comes off easily but does not rinse off.
--------------------
I like taking this work everyday. I can have something with more flavor than just water but without the guilt of sugar, calories, and salt of other beverages. This is the flavor I like best.
--------------------
Love this for my water bottle. I love presweetened and only use 1/2 packet. Easy to take with you.
--------------------
Very good. My father drinks this instead of water sometimes and he says the flavor is just as good or better than other brands. I love it and I recommend this Iced tea to others. Affordable and worth the money
--------------------
I liked the flavor and the portions are perfect for me it is easy to use l really recommended it you will love it
--------------------
I really enjoy these. Water was something that we extremely hard for me to make a habit in my life so these really helped me jumpstart that to wear I felt it was good now I love to drink plan water but this did make it an easy transition. These are very affordable and I do recommend
--------------------
I love ice tea and Crystal Light is my favorite. It tastes like the ice tea I grew up with. It has a perfect balance of lemon and fresh tea flavor. I buy it regularly. If you like ice tea and dont want the calories, buy this one.
--------------------
this is a staple in our cabinet. This is really the only iced tea I will drink regularly. Its the perfect ratio!
--------------------
Its not bad. Id say I like it better than other iced teas and if Im not wrong it doesnt have sugar. Also the flavor is pretty strong. Id say its not bad at all.
--------------------
My entire family loved Crystal light iced Tea I don't really care for them myself but my family really loves them so I do buy them for them They think it taste like regular ice Tea I just don't like it but it is very affordable With this I have to say to each its own.
--------------------
I love these quick lemon tea pouches Just add to your water bottles Great to keep at work when you need a delicious drink
--------------------
This is my go to instant iced tea mix. I love the flavor and convenience of this product. I would highly recommend if you need tea on the go! It’s easy to mix up and easy to take a pack with you and add to water.
--------------------
A favorite to mix with bottled water. A quick shake and an instant good-for-you treat. It also makes a great cocktail punch when added to a couple ingredients.
--------------------
Good taste, a full packet is personally way too much for a regular water bottle. I can get away with about half a packet and the flavor is still great. In my mind thats more bang for your buck.
--------------------
I'm not really a water drinker. But with these powder singles it helps me get my daily intake. The taste is amazing and light. My son has begun to drink these too they are that good!
--------------------
Very nice drink mix. Easy to use and very convenient. Makes a good once in a while treat and is perfect for party drinks. The drink is not too sweet and can be customized and diluted based on how much water you add. Very inexpensive. I will buy again. I highly recommend.
--------------------
Mango peach green tea is amazing! So refreshing! Plus its calorie free! Add to your water and be on your way!
--------------------
Yum!! I love this flavor. Green tea is great all around but when you add mango to it it is even better. This low calorie drink pack is well worth the moneg
--------------------
My mom always drinks these and she always sends me away with one or two for my purse. This is a great treat that you dont have to feel bad about. Such a refreshing drink and easy to shake in your water bottle!
--------------------
I love this one.. it soo good I normally drink a packet twice a week but sometimes I get a bit carried away
--------------------
I have been buying these over and over for so long. They are so convenient and you dont have to worry about measuring anything. They taste awesome and I can find them at all grocery stores! Would buy again!
--------------------
Good product. Great flavor. No Sugar added plus this size is enough to serve a whole Family and it makes it more economic... The travel sizes are also great for on the go into a bottle of water.
--------------------
Pretty flavorful drink mix, sugar free however it has 3g of carbohydrates per serving. This product does contain aspartame. Each packet mixes with any 16.9 ounce water bottle, or at least 2 cups of water.
--------------------
These taste just like orange juice! I love drinking these I get all the flavour of ornage juice but minus all the sugar and calories that comes with orange juice. I love the flavour of these packets. They normally quench my thirst and hit the spot.
--------------------
Ive always had a issue drinking soda and couldnt find a good alternative to keep my taste buds happy until I found these. They taste great have caffeine and are a affordable price
--------------------
Love the lemon iced tea flavor. It is something with flavor other than just always water.
--------------------
Tastes amazing and of great quality. You can control the taste and concentration. I really like this brand .
--------------------
This is amazing. It tastes just like peach tea. It is a weird idea but i really enjoy this to help drink more water throughout the day.
--------------------
This plus caffeine is the best thing on earth. So easy to get the drinks I need to carry on my day
--------------------
I just discovered this flavor and fell in love. I do feel it's a bit too sweet if i add it to a water bottle so i use a giant mug &add ice and extra water. I love that it's sugar free, i don't have to worry about extra sugar & calories. It's also nice that it has some caffeine in it to give me a little boost.
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite drink mix now. I quit drinking soda and starting drinking this. I love it. It tastes so good. For once in my life,I am drinking water and lots of it because of this citrus mix.
--------------------
I love it this product its great. I think everyone should try it out. I dont know that my honest opinion
--------------------
Best drink I have ever tried And since they sell on the go or to make big ones it’s really easy to drink it anywhere
--------------------
My grandparents love this tea. It tastes great and is a good value. We don't use any other tea mixes in this house. We have repurchased this tea multiple times in the past.
--------------------
This flavor is my favorite! Love it! I can seriously drink this everyday all day
--------------------
I have enjoyed your Crystal Light products for several years. However it seems you keep getting rid of the best flavors and this usually happens when a new "Flavored Tea" comes out.

I love this flavor. It is getting harder to fine in my area stores. Wondering where I can by the multipack of the Energy Peach mango on the go packs
--------------------
Really enjoy the flavor. I pour a big (24oz) glass and it's gone before I even notice. Smooth and tasty! I'm constantly making another pitcher! BUT....why does it leave a white residue in the clear pitcher and clear glass. Like there are undissolved solids in the mix and you really should scrub the pitcher after each use. What's with that? Not too 'crystal'. Comes off easily but does not rinse off.
--------------------
This was not my favorite flavor. It was very very sweet and heavy on the peach flavor, not something I prefer. I would definitely dial down the sweetness and make it more tea forward if I could change something. I dont think Ill be buying this flavor again.
--------------------
Love these for my water! I also love how affordable these are, and they give you so many. I will totally continue to purchase. And I recommend to everyone. They are a good way to get your water intake if your like me its hard to drink water but this helps@so much (60 Pack) Crystal Light On-The-Go Sugar-Free Powdered Peach Mango Drink Mix, 6 - 0.7 oz Boxes
--------------------
This is such a great tasting tea without all the sugar and caffeine! Easy to make. The peach flavor is not overpowering but very refreshing!
--------------------
Sweet and refreshing love it 10/10 For the price and amount of product its amazing
--------------------
SUPER potent. I enjoy the flavor but you really don't need to pour the entire package in your water. Otherwise it is very sweet and too potent.
--------------------
Totally addicted these taste so good.
--------------------
Love these for my water! I also love how affordable these are, and they give you so many. I will totally continue to purchase. And I recommend to everyone.
--------------------
My kids ask for this by name! Its easy not having sugary drinks or sodas in the house when this tastes so good! We keep this made in a pitcher in the fridge. Its very refreshing! I love the marriage of the tea and the peach, its a great combination without being too overwhelming of either. Excellent price!
--------------------
This peach tea is so refreshing when ice cold. I love being able to just throw a couple of packets in my purse for when I'm on the go.
--------------------
I love this tea it tastes so good and has great flavor I also love that you can mix flavors together and they still taste good I recommend you try them they have a bunch to choose from.
--------------------
This is surprisingly good, and it actually tastes like tea. The peach is perfect. I don’t get any odd sweetener after taste.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite flavors and powdered drink mixes. The peach flavor is delicious! I use the bigger version for family lunches and dinners. It’s a quick way to make a drink and keeps more space in the refrigerator. I recommend this product! [product:crystal-light-on-the-go-peach-mango-green-tea-powdered-drink-mix-10-ct-08-oz-packets]
--------------------
Bring back memories. I grew up with this stuff my mom always use to buy this. Medium peach taste. Not too strong or too light. Great for summertime.
--------------------
it was very good but slightly messy, when i opened it it spilled everywhere.
--------------------
My absolute favorite alternative to sugared tea. I like other flavors too, but LONG LIVE PEACH!
--------------------
I love crystal light. All the ones I have tried taste so good. I like traveling as well and it tastes sweet but not overly sweet. This one has a nice hint of peach. I just wish it didnt stain my teeth. I would drink this everyday, but because of the staining I dont drink it much anymore.
--------------------
Even though this is a drink powder, it tastes exactly like regular peach tea! Sometimes it can be hard to drink plain water all of the time, but these on the go packets are easy and convenient to use. The flavor is great and you wouldn’t be able to tell it’s from a drink packet.
--------------------
This is my favourite of the crystal light flavors. I have a large mug so that i can add ice&also dilute it if i want. I highly recommend this for anyone trying to watch their sugar intake!
--------------------
I’ve always loved Crystal Light products. I used to always get Strawberry-Kiwi until I needed a secondary peach tea flavor closest to Sonic without having to go to Sonic. The taste isn’t the best as it has a funky and weird aftertaste.
--------------------
[product:crystal-light-on-the-go-sugar-free-powdered-peach-tea] I buy the one that makes 2 quarts. I love to mix it up and have it all day. It is really good and has great peach tea flavor. It isn't too sweet tasting but it does have a sweetness to it. The peach flavor is like a juicy fresh peach not that artificial peach taste.
--------------------
Literally drinking this one as I type LOL it is so good! I usually put it into a 20-24 oz water bottle and it tastes delicious and curbs my sweet tooth!
--------------------
Great price but taste is a little lite it would be nice to taste peach more. I always put one or 2 in my gym bag easy for on the go. Also it would be great if they had more flavors.
--------------------
This peach iced tea is my favorite iced tea ever! Whenever I make a big batch it gets polished off. I honestly prefer it to the original.
--------------------
Love the peach tea crystal light! I usually use less than directed amount since I find the full amount is a bit too sweet for my tastes. I use these in my Yeti bottles and it helps me drink more water every day! Nice to have a change from plain water.
--------------------
My favorite drink for summer!! I do weight watchers and this is great for me because it’s 0 points and taste great!! My husband even enjoys it!
--------------------
I could drive the stuff all day every time. It’s very refreshing and it’s not too strong. The packaging makes it really easy to open it’s very convenient that you can take it with you on the go. This is my go to flavor out of all of the Crystal Light flavors.
--------------------
A great way to change up water drinking! Love getting the singles use and the pitcher mixes too in thei peach flavor!
--------------------
When I’m in a hurry for school or just a hurry for whatever I’m doing or wherever I’m at and need a drink and don’t want just water I like to have these in my purse and in my backpack and I will use one for the days I’m not feeling just having water to drink! The peach tea is so delicious it doesn’t taste like it’s sugar free at all which is why I like it so much because I don’t usually like things that are sugar free for the simple fact I can usually taste that fake sugar. But not this. This peach tea tastes so good and is definitely a good quality taste! It’s not a cheap tasting peach tea it tastes like a good sweet peach tea you would get from the south on a hott day when your looking for a nice cold refresher! Definitely recommend! These are usually at the dollar store for a box of the to go packets and their super affordable!
--------------------
I love this peach tea and drink it a lot to add to my water is the easiest and way better for me than soda pop. I love the convenience of slipping a few pouches in my purse and then can just pull them out when needed. The price is great!
--------------------
Crystal light peach tea is the most delicious, it’s always really good in the summer when you’ve been out in the hot all day.
--------------------
Can’t beat a good peach tea crystal lite packet. These just hit the spot every time yum
--------------------
The best for when I need a little bit of taste added to my water. Best flavor ever. Very cheap
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite. This is one of the easiest ways to add it to my water and increase my water intake
--------------------
I’m not a big water drinker so these help me be better. They’re easy to bring with me on the go to add to my water bottles.
--------------------
This is my on the go drink that I take every where I go. It taste amazing and I have not found another alternative that taste any better than this. The only thing I would improve is if they could make another version without the aspartame in it. I definitely will purchase again.
--------------------
I love this for enhancing my water intake. Love the peach and tea flavor. Tastes like the real thing. I don’t think this needs improvement. I’m a repeat customer and it’s available at the coffee shop at my work.
--------------------
I love this, especially in the summer. It so easy to make, so refreshing, and it's low calorie! I don't taste that telltale "fake sugar" base that a lot of sugar-free drinks have, either, so this mix is definitely a winner for me and I always have some on hand.
--------------------
Best diet tea around. I watch calories and carbs and this is my go to drink. It's affordable and versatile. No improvements needed.
--------------------
I recently tried the peach tea at a work function and it was absolutely delicious. It didn’t taste overly sweet or synthetic which can be an issues with similar products.
--------------------
Really good in a nice cold bottle of iced water. Tastes like a peach snapple on the go. I would purchase this again.
--------------------
[product:crystal-light-on-the-go-peach-iced-tea-drink-mix] Good for using when you're on the go. The grape one is really good as well. Not too sweet and good priced product.
--------------------
So for years I was obsessed with the lemonade flavor, both regular and pink. I tried the peach iced tea and now I am hooked! It is so so good!
--------------------
Yum yum yum. I love this stuff it’s great. Very easy to make and delicious. I love that they are individual and can be kept in your desk for a pick me up.
--------------------
This flavor is my favorite! Love it! I can seriously drink this everyday all day
--------------------
I love this drink mix so much. It prevents me from drinking soda and it tastes great. The price is definitely affordable for how many packets come inside. I have not tried other flavors, but the sweet tea flavor is amazing.
--------------------
I have enjoyed your Crystal Light products for several years. However it seems you keep getting rid of the best flavors and this usually happens when a new "Flavored Tea" comes out. Not all people are tea lovers and we liked these flavors. Flavors include: Lemon Lime, the green one from years ago; Ruby Red Grapefruit, another old flavor; Newer flavors include: Cherry Limeade; and Cherry Pomegranate. Who chooses which flavors get deleted and which get saved. I wish these old flavors could come back and if you must get rid of some how about Fruit Punch and Grape.
--------------------
Opened a brand new tube of powdered drink mix and all the packets were rock hard. Best by date of 10May2020.
--------------------
This is my most favorite flavor of any drink mix. The peach flavor is strong but not overwhelming. It is sweet, but not super sweet.
--------------------
My family and I have been huge fans of Crystal Light Peach Ice Tea for years.... and then they changed the recipe. Now it's "made with Black Tea" and is not very good at all. The actual flavor varies from package to package and from bad to worse. I wonder if Kraft ever heard of the success Coke had in changing their recipe?
--------------------
I stopped drinking carbonated beverages about 6 years ago and Crystal Light has become one of main replacements. I really like this drink but I'm bored. I need new flavors, adult flavors. Pineapple would be great, Watermelon, a fusion of different flavors. Passion fruit. I loved the Mojito you had a couple years ago, a mint tea would be nice. Please give us more variety?
--------------------
Great Stuff, I am a recent kidney transplant patient and need to control my electrolytes, especially potassium. Can you tell me how much potassium is in the lemonade and orange flavor Crystal Light?
--------------------
I have a secret recipe combining diffrent flavors of Crystal Light that everytime I place a pitcher on the table it does'nt last!!! Even with the experienced Crystal Light lovers or the sugar free haters. I'm always asked to contact you because is a hit in all parties and they would like to drink at home.
--------------------
Mo Mo Mojito! I love your Mojito flavored Crystal Light! It was great in cocktails and a delicious combined with Peach Tea! I am trying to replicate it but there is no substitute!! Please bring it back! MO MO MOJITO!!!
--------------------
Great taste and definitely will purchase more
--------------------
This is my favorite flavor of all the Crystal Light products. It has a great peach tea taste and is so refreshing!! I like mine a little strong, so I reduce the water by an ounce or so. Be aware that this flavor does contain caffeine, so if you are sensitive to that, don't drink it late at night! I try to avoid sugar and this has a wonderful sweetness that satisfies my cravings.
--------------------
What happened to their best flavor??? Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink? This was by far the best powdered mix made by anyone and they discontinued it? too bad. the others are good but nothing was like that. BRING IT BACK...please!!!
--------------------
I love this flavor. It is getting harder to fine in my area stores. Wondering where I can by the multipack of the Energy Peach mango on the go packs
--------------------
Really enjoy the flavor. I pour a big (24oz) glass and it's gone before I even notice. Smooth and tasty! I'm constantly making another pitcher! BUT....why does it leave a white residue in the clear pitcher and clear glass. Like there are undissolved solids in the mix and you really should scrub the pitcher after each use. What's with that? Not too 'crystal'. Comes off easily but does not rinse off.
--------------------
We drink this all the time. It would be great if you could make this with decaffeinated tea. We have given up all sodas, most of our coffee, and drink this tea and water.
--------------------
I was drinking so many sodas, and that wasn't good for me. I now drink the peach Chrystal Light peach tea. I haven't had a soda in at least a week. I don't crave the sodas like I did. Thank you, Crystal Light!
--------------------
This is my beverage of choice. I was introduced to it back in the 90's. Always a great refreshing taste ad way better than sodas.
--------------------
It's been over 20 years and this is still my go-to drink to have in the fridge. Everyone loves it and it's cheap and refreshing as always!
--------------------
This is my favorite Crystal Light flavor! I do add a bit of regular lemonade and essential oils for flavor. With 8 kids ranging in age from 18 down to 11 months, I don’t have time for naps and survive off the caffeine. ;p
--------------------
My husband absolutely loves this drink. I’ve tasted it and think they flavor is just fine. He prefers it over other brands.
--------------------
The flavor is not good, had to add stevia. But the energy boost was something that shocked me. I worked an 8 hour shift and still call me home and cleaned from top to bottom and did 6 loads of laundry. I have severe Sciatica and I even had the energy to carry everything on my own. Energy boost 5/5, flavor without stevia 1/5.
--------------------
I’ve been drinking this once a day for about 3 years. I keep getting everyone hooked on it :) 

It’s getting harder to find at other stories, so please Target, KEEP selling this! I love that it’s stevia, not asparatame, and it’s the perfect dose of caffeine. The non-caffeinated Tangerine Mango is also so so good!
--------------------
I don't drink soda/pop these are all I drink so I am not forced to drink plain water day in and day out. I am obsessed! They come in a lot of great flavors now and why they don't do away with the other ones that are sweetened with sucralose is beyond me. This is is all I drink and only because it's sweetened with Stevia. It's really the way to go!
--------------------
LOVE this stuff!!! I don't like coffee or tea, and have been drinking crystal light w/caffeine for years. There have been so many times that I've tried to cut out aspartame, but was never really able to because I couldn't find anything caffeinated without a ton of calories to drink daily as my "coffee" substitute. Then crystal light finally came out with this stuff!! A little more expensive than the regular crystal light w/caffeine, but WORTH IT to get the energy without the artificial sweeteners or tons of calories. And I love the taste of this one! total lifesaver for this coffee-hating full time nurse and grad student :)
--------------------
Love it! Nice light flavor and love that it has caffeine without added calories! So glad I found this because I don't like coffee and pop is too unhealthy to be drinking everyday. As a new mom, I'm grateful for this product!
--------------------
I drink Crystal Light Strawberry Caffeine every day. It used to be labeled as Energy, not sure why they changed it to Caffeine. But any way, I bought the Pure Energy, hoping that it would give me a little more energy, then what I have been drinking. The only reason I even gave it 2 stars, was because it did give me some energy. BUT, the taste is absolutely horrible! I actually ganged, when I drank it. At first I thought that maybe I wasn't using enough water. But, I was. I will not be buying again. If you do purchase this product, be sure to read the label. One packet goes into one bottle of water (16.9 fl oz), but it is actually listed as 2 servings. So, you might want to just start off drinking a half a bottle.
--------------------
I like strawberry lemonade, but this didn't taste at all like expected. Did not enjoy it, and would not purchase again.
--------------------
Has a pleasant and refreshing flavor without too much of an artificial sweetener after taste. Nice way to stay caffeinated, refreshed, and hydrated on hot summer days, and cheaper than a cup of iced coffee.
--------------------
I love the taste of these in my water bottle at work.  I work at night and these have a little caffeine which is an added bonus, but not too much.  I pretty much have tried them all and buy exclusively this brand, this flavor.
--------------------
Great flavor and love the caffeine boost it gives me. The best part - no artificial sweeteners!
--------------------
Great flavor and product. Nothing artificial. Gives great energy.
--------------------
Great product. Good taste. Natural alternative. More refreshing than coffee for that morning boost. I bought quite a bit of them already.
--------------------
Perfect packets for on the go. Great for a small boost of energy when the day has ran long and of course low in calories so I can get something sweet without completely ruining my diet by drinking my calories!
--------------------
I get so bored drinking plain old water everyday. I love these crystal light flavors to bring so me excitement to my hydration. I drink so much more water when I use one or two of these a day. Plus they are so good and tasty! The whole family loves them.
--------------------
This strawberry flavor is awesome. Tangy and sweet. I love the product even more with the small caffeine boost!
--------------------
I love love love these. They taste so delicious. The packaging is great, highly unlikely to break open. These are very easy to put into water to drink! Perfect for school lunches. I would for sure buy again.
--------------------
These are perfect for when I need a boost of caffeine and don't want to grab an energy drink or soda. The taste is great, especially compared to some other brands I've tried. It's sometimes a little hard to mix but other than that I have no complaints
--------------------
Always delicious! These packets are easy to use and taste great. Makes daily water consumption so much more tasty! Highly recommend!
--------------------
I dont know what I would do without this stuff. I literally drink it daily. Has caused me to stop drinking pop
--------------------
These are the absolute best. They taste amazing and give a great burst of energy from the caffeine. Its perfect for on the go and has an amazing flavor. I would recommend this product to anyone and definitely would buy it again.
--------------------
Honestly cant make it through a day without this. Its tasty and caffeinated and I NEED caffeine, but I hate coffee, dont drink energy drinks, and sometimes tea isnt enough. This is perfect for a pick-me-up.
--------------------
I drink this rain every day in my water tasted really good just playing dolls Ill give us a five star rating
--------------------
These are good on the go! Has caffeine in it and it tastes pretty good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
--------------------
These are a great way to up your water intake. Easily thrown in lunch bag, work bag or purse. I leave them in my locker at work so I always have some with me. I get bored with plain water so this helps me drink as much water as I can!
--------------------
I prefer natural, unrefined sweeteners such as stevia or honey but in a pinch this would do if you something flavored and low in calories.
--------------------
I like crystal light because the flavors are great and they are low in calories and sugars. Anytime I’m tired of drinking water I add one of these to satisfy my cravings for sodas or something sweet.
--------------------
These are good to add to ice cold water on a hot day. Hey remind me of the refreshers from Starbucks without as much caffeine.
--------------------
Always a favorite crystal light product!! It’s so good and the caffeine is 100% great!!
--------------------
I buy this product because I do not like to drink water and with this since is tasty I find myself drinking more water
--------------------
Taste is amazing and so convenient. I love the fact that it has extra caffeine! This definitely helps me through the day. I also love how many different flavors there are. The to-go packets fit get in my person so I can add flavor anywhere and any time.
--------------------
I heard about this product thru my boyfriends mom because I pretty much hate water and I’ve been drinking too much soda and sugar. This is a good replacement for it even tho I still miss soda so much.
--------------------
Pretty good. I’m trying to stay away from soda and sugary drinks so I like crystal light. Flavor is pretty good. I add extra water to sort of water it down. I’ve bought crystal light before and I will buy again.
--------------------
My friend turned me onto these little caffeine packets after I didn't being any caffeine with me on a two week field exercise and kept getting awful headaches from withdrawal. The watermelon flavor is so refreshing and the absolute convenience of having my caffeine in the morning with some water is like two birds with one stone!
--------------------
Refreshing. Bold and thirst quenching flavor. So easy to use. In a water bottle to go or a glass at home.
--------------------
I love this for work I drink water all day but when I need something refreshing and fast I us this and it hits the spot
--------------------
I LOVE this drink mix. The flavor is delicious, and the powder dissolves quickly. I also notice that it gives me a strong spurt of energy with the caffeine in it. This is a great pick me up for afternoon slug times. Definitely give this a try!
--------------------
This is a great way to jazz up your water. It helps me drink more water and with the added caffeine, it helps me with my energy. I keep a box of this flavor at work and use a whole packet for my 30oz tumbler and it tastes great.
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite drink! I have one every morning, it's the perfect amount of caffeine & it helps me drink water! Plus - it tastes so good!!
--------------------
My all time favorite drink and flavor. These are always stashed away in my cabinets at home, in my purse and in my desk at work. They’re the perfect pick me up and don’t have an artificial taste to them.
--------------------
Another great flavor my house loves to drink. This crystal light packets are perfect for us when we want some flavor in our lives.
--------------------
Not my first choice because it’s a light flavor. I wish it was stronger. I also wish it was sweeter but I like ￼ sickening sweet
--------------------
Great for adding flavor if you want a little taste to your water! There are SO many different flavors and you can control how much sweetness there is!
--------------------
My family loves the crystal light wild strawberry water flavor powders. They are easy to use and have a great taste.
--------------------
This is a good brand to put in your water. It give the water flavors. No I brought this brand a couple of times. Nothing to improve this product. I drink one package throughout the day. It an excellent flavor. Yes I would buy this brand always. I will recommend this product for others to buy and try out.
--------------------
Personally, I love these add-ons for Waters because sometimes water bottle tastes weird to me. I especially love this flavor but you can't really go wrong because they're all pretty light and easy going.
--------------------
This stuff is gross, so unhealthy for you. I get it you want somthing sweet and this is way better then a cookie or a peace of cake or pie or somthing but it just tastes so fake and not somthing I'd want to put in my body. I know alot of people love it
--------------------
I love this on the go crystal light packet with caffeine. It taste so good and it so much more fun than just regular water! I drink this when i don’t have time for a coffee and it keeps me energized and hydrated!
--------------------
Love love love this! I love the brand in general & they have yet to let me down in anyway. I buy diff things all the time & haven’t been disappointed yet!
--------------------
This is my favorite flavor water enhancer. I only gave it 4 stars because I think you could buy the off brand for cheaper and it tastes the same.
--------------------
I like crystal it has a great taste very flavorful. No room for improvement . I love the fact that it's low in calorie and still have a wonderful strong flavor . It's affordable great value.
--------------------
I’ve been trying to find a way to drink more water. Since the water in New York isn’t that great to drink on its own. Because I only drink faucet water. I mix and Crystal light, wylers light or mio to help me. I don’t put a lot in it sometimes I use half a packet.￼
--------------------
This is definitely delicious. It’s very juicy. It has caffeine in it but I haven’t noticed any effects from the caffeine
--------------------
Love these, they taste great and keep me from drinking soda, also give me a little energy to get through the day
--------------------
The best drink mix to add to a bottle of water! Now that we stopped drinking soda here, we always have a variety of flavors on hand. I will never go back to plain water!
--------------------
Tastes good and gives me a little pick me up without the side effects. There are other caffeine flavors but I like this one most
--------------------
I really like the crystal light that come with caffeine because I am cutting out soda and one of the horrible side effects are the headaches I get from not getting caffeine. These drink mixes alleviate those headaches!
--------------------
Anything strawberry always captures my attention but I love that this is caffeinated, so at times when I want to just drink water in the morning instead, this is great at keeping me hydrated with some taste! And of course, I love adding some crystal light mixed into my titos
--------------------
I like this crystal light flavor I just wished it was tea and not just a fruit flavored drink! I enjoy drinking this packet because it has caffeine added to it which helps me in the morning when I need it the most
--------------------
I can’t function without caffeine and get bored with drinking coffee and water all days so I was looking forward to trying this. The caffeine kick isn’t too strong and it’s a little too sweet for my liking.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite drink mixes ever! I love how it gets me to drink more water! Before I was a coffee drinker, I used to drink this in my morning college classes because it has caffeine! It tastes so good!
--------------------
Loved this as a kid in the summer or made into a popsicle. As an adult, I highly recommend adding tequila for a skinny margarita!
--------------------
Love love love this! I love the brand in general & they have yet to let me down in anyway. I buy diff things all the time & haven’t been disappointed yet!
--------------------
This is a great strawberry flavor. I would recommend if you don’t enjoy drinking water.
--------------------
I use this in my water nearly every day! It is very refreshing! If you like the flavor of strawberry or just get tired of drinking plain water, try a water packet in it! So good!
--------------------
After my weight loss surgery, i have to get in min 90 oz of fluids a day, and these have made my life so much easier! Tasty, refreshing, And definitely had helped a ton!
--------------------
I can’t drink water with out Crystal Light. Changes water and takes it to another level.
--------------------
My fave morning drink. Love the taste and the caffeine boost!! Easy to travel with!
--------------------
There are so many flavors to choose from. Easy to mix. Good taste. Good price. My family likes the choices.
--------------------
These help me drink so much more water than I typically would. It’s so delicious and gives me the little pick me up I need in the afternoons
--------------------
My favorite!!! They taste so good and they make me drink more water throughout the day. I always have this is my house and in my purse for on the go. Perfect for when you’re thirsty but tired of water!
--------------------
It has caffeine and tastes delicious with little to no calories , it is perfect to keep in your purse when you wanna spice up a drink at a restaurant without paying extra
--------------------
This drink mix is so so yummy. I am a nurse and can always use all the caffeine I can get, and sometimes an energy drink just doesn’t sound good, so I bought these. Very affordable and turned out to be super yummy, and still very effective! Definitely recommend!
--------------------
This tastes super good. If you don’t want water you can turn it into juice it just some shakes
--------------------
These are my favorite crystal light drink mix. Gives your energy without the extra sugar. The flavor is great.
--------------------
I love all crystal light flavors but this is my favorite keep it up love it I am a repeat consumer and it’s very affordable I wouldn’t change a thing
--------------------
Love this flavor. I love the pick me up the caffeine in these has. Great alternative to drinking soda.
--------------------
This is perfect for any hot day where you need to cool off with some flavor! I’ve tried this so many times and am not stopping anytime soon
--------------------
Love adding this to my water. This flavor is a little too intense. I typically use one packet to 32 oz of water.
--------------------
Love this drink! Super yummy and really refreshing! Also give you a little bit of energy which is a plus !
--------------------
I love these. Water can get boring sometimes and these are perfect for that. They are so easy to use and super affordable.
--------------------
Love strawberry so I bought this and loved it. Price is good. Taste is good. Mixes well. Doesn’t sit at the bottom
--------------------
I was excited to see strawberry my favorite flavor with caffeine which is kind of exciting you could get your kicks without drinking coffee or soda pop but this has like all other products from this brand a terrible aftertaste I don’t like the sweetener they use I wish they would switch it to something different that doesn’t give you that icky flavor when you’re done drinking if you get cold enough you can tolerate it and get through it but it’s just offputting and the price for these is just asinine
--------------------
We love this juice mix! We always mix it with our vodka, especially when it’s hot and sunny out.
--------------------
I absolutely love these. They taste very similar to the Starbucks drink I’d have fewer calories and are so much cheaper. I have to keep these around the house at all times. I also love the fact that they contain caffeine￼
--------------------
Sometimes it’s good. Other times it’s not perfect. Still a drink mix regardless. Add water and shake
--------------------
Crystal Light is my favorite drink mix brand. This flavor does not disappoint. It is great to use as a mixer as well! Yum!
--------------------
Me encanta el sabor y la frescura de esta bebida es realmente deliciosa y todos los sabores me encantan
--------------------
I love these so much! My favorite thing about these powders is that they are caffeinated and low calorie! When I was on vacation my boyfriends family had them and now Im hooked
--------------------
These dont taste like fake sweetener. Nice flavor. Easy to take to work for when youre sick of water.
--------------------
I love these little packets! They taste great and are just what I need at 2:00 in the afternoon when you start to feel sluggish while at work!
--------------------
Easy, convenient, and tastes good. I love the packets because you can just grab it and go. Affordable
--------------------
I love Crystal light especially with caffeine and make it so much better I highly recommend
--------------------

Adding Crystal Light to my water makes me drink enough throughout the day! It tastes so good but isnt packed with sugar.

This stuff is heaven. I absolutely love it. Its sweet but not too sweet and the strawberry taste is on point. Probably would be a lot better with cut up strawberrys in it ! Plus its a good price !

Im not a soda drinker so I love crystal light when I want something sweet to drink. The wild strawberry is my favorite and I like the boost from the caffeine. I keep these in my desk at work. They keep me hydrated and give me a boost to get through the day.

I have a hard time drinking water in general and these help give my water flavor and a kick of caffeine to help me get my water intake in the mornings!
--------------------
When I only have bottled water to drink and in the mood for some flavor crystal light is my go to. I enjoy all the flavors they have.
--------------------
As a child my mom refused to buy us coolaid. She always bought crystal light. And honestly its good, I still drink it sometimes today. Adds nice flavor if you dont want to drink regular water.
--------------------
We have bought alot of boxes of crystal light powered strips. This is a must have if you have children or if you are simply someone who works alot and spends time out and about.
--------------------
I love the taste and its so easy to make all you need is a water bottle and that packet. So easy and fast just dump it inside the bottle and done I would for sure reccomend thsi to others.

This tastes and smells like green apple jolly ranchers. It is extremely good and I make popsicles with it. It’s not really sour, but I don’t care. It’s worth it to try and kids will love it.
--------------------
I picked up this juice expecting something different.  Little did I know that I was going to be getting something completely different. when I was mixing the juice up it smelled great like green shampoo  Green jolly rancher.  I couldn’t wait to fill my cup up with ice and pour the juice in.  when I rose my glass to my lips and I let the juice cascade down my throat I was hit with the worst taste of all time. I don’t know I wouldn’t recommend this used to my worst enemy. Do not buy this juice. It is NASTY.
