Price is great and they taste great too.
--------------------
They taste just like the brand name Wavy Lays, but at a much better price, and make for a perfect afternoon snack. Definitely repurchasing!
--------------------
For the price alone these are worth 5 stars!
--------------------
Very fresh and tasty. They were simply delicious!￼
--------------------
Crispy and salty. Just as good as Wavy Lays.
--------------------
The chips were mostly broken crumbles, which wouldn't be bad as a crumb coating for fried chicken. However, they're horrible for dipping...
--------------------
Great crunch. Great quantity in the bag. delicious and salty
--------------------
Great taste and value !
--------------------
Flavor just as if not better than name brand
--------------------
First time I tried this brand and liked it!!
--------------------
Delicious chips that rival name brand!!
--------------------
As good as the name brand chips at a much better price!
--------------------
Good potato chips, similar to wise !
--------------------
nothing special, but fine for the price
--------------------
Good chips at a good price
--------------------
Delicious chips and affordable price!
--------------------
When you are on a budget and want a chip that is like classic lays these are it. I honestly am starting to prefer these.
--------------------
GLUTEN FREE!!! the taste is excellent, the chip is sturdy for dipping, a little too salty, but I like that (& it helps me to eat less chips).
--------------------
Way too salty!  I usually don't mind the Market Pantry brand on most of the basic grocery items, but these missed the mark.  The chip itself was good, so I'd be willing to try again with less salt!
--------------------
They were eaten within 24 hours. These are great chips at a reasonable price. The bag is the size of a regular family size bag of chips. The ridges are more gentle sloping than sharp ridges. The texture of the chip is softer not mushy but a soft crunch and not like the hard style of kettle cooked chips. I prefer these over the kettle style as I feel they are gentler on your teeth, gums and there is no risk of damage to your dental work. 

We will be purchasing again and using them for bbqs and other family functions. They are a definite crowd pleaser!
--------------------
Always fresh, thankfully not crushed during shipping. I miss in store shopping!
--------------------
Perfect with some dip!
--------------------
Ruffles are my favorite chips
--------------------
Ruffles Original are an absolute household favorite. You really can't go wrong. They are the perfect crowd pleaser. I've bought them both in store and had them delivered, and have never encountered a problem.
--------------------
Fresh, everyone enjoyed this product.
--------------------
Always fresh and easily available!
--------------------
My daughters favorite chips
--------------------
It came in the same box as heavy things that I had ordered These chips were crushed to dust.
--------------------
I prefer the low fat Ruffles with Sea Salt because they truly taste the same minus the overly greasiness but if that’s not an option, these are pretty tasty as well. It’s a little too oily for me to eat a lot but I still love ruffles. Beats Lays any day! Haha
--------------------
A delicious chip with innovative grooves which enhance the structural integrity of the chip.  This chip is a winner and I would eat as many as I possibly could.
--------------------
Great chip to have in your pantry for any occasion....as a side for sandwiches to holding up for dips. Can't get yummier than Ruffles with ridges.
--------------------
Yummy
Bag had many crumbled chips but the flavor was there
--------------------
Delicious! These are my favorite go-to chips since I love the saltiness and the crispness is so satisfying.
--------------------
They were good as always
--------------------
Chips are delicious.  The problem was in the packaging.  Two of five bags had popped open in the box, likely because heavier objects packed with them put pressure on the bags.
--------------------
I'm not sure what it is about these chips, but they are one of the only things keeping my morning sickness at bay! It doesn't hurt that they're also delicious!
--------------------
Very tasty chips with mild seasoning
--------------------
Honestly really good, only purchased because they were on sale but I loved them! Would purchase again
--------------------
I loved this brand but this bag was stale, the expiration date wasnfor 2021 but they just tasted awful
--------------------
I purchase this brand of chips often. They are GREAT!
--------------------
Crunchy, salty, and a little sweet. My favorite chip!
--------------------
I like...tasted better than other chips
--------------------
LOVE these chips!!! So delicious. Savory with a slight sweetness.
--------------------
This chip is extremely salty compared to the other flavor from this brand.
--------------------
Ordered these twice and both times they were well past the expiration date.
--------------------
I really like the variety of textures and there is a good sea salt flavor.
--------------------
I love these chips...they are delicious.
--------------------
Can’t go wrong with Cape Cod! Love all of their variety of chips but this is the original you can’t go wrong with!
--------------------
These chips are the perfect blend of crispness, salt, tang, and potato yumminess. I’m not sure why I decided to pick up a bag, but I’m delighted. These are now a regular part of my snack pantry.
--------------------
Favorite chip of ALL time. Perfect crunch and low fat and LOW SODIUM. These actually have less sodium than the "low sodium" cape cods.
--------------------
These are seriously THE BEST chips ever! They are so crunchy and the amount of salt is perfect! You don’t have to feel guilty with these either bc they are 40% leas fat than regular potato chips!
--------------------
If you’ve never had cape cod potato chips, you’re missing out! I love these chips. If you’re not a fan of kettle chips, I’d pass on these. My family and I love these and these are typically the only potato chips my family buys.
--------------------
These are by far one of the best kettle chips ever! Just the right amount of salt and crisp plus 50% reduced fat! Yass
--------------------
These are fantastic chips. Chiptastic if you will. Crunchy and delicious and pairs well with some onion dip.
--------------------
I could literally eat these everyday. So delicious. Perfect amount of salt and crunch.
--------------------
I love these chips. They are a very good snack for on the go or just lounging at home. They are salty and crunchy. They are satisfying when you are craving something salty. I also find that in my personal opinion they aren’t completely addictive so I am able to put them down when I am full which is a bonus in a chip!
--------------------
These chips are addictive!  Bite size, lots of crunch, great taste and less fat, too.  I buy them at Costco in the huge bag and limit myself to an ounce a day since they are so easy to just gobble up.
--------------------
unbelievably terrible tasting.  so so so so nasty.  is the salt, the potatoes, or the oil?  has to be the potatoes.  these are not the only "flavor" of these chips that is horrible.  no more.  ever.
--------------------
So delicious. Not too greasy or salty. Amazing price point. And 40% less guilt than the full fat version.
--------------------
I love these chips and their low in fat.. i compared these to veggie sticks and chips and their the same calories... much rather eat these
--------------------
Almost not even discernible from the non reduced fat version. Truly a masterpiece of potato chips
--------------------
Yummy yummy. Not to salty, and have a perfect crunch. Perfect pairing with sandwiches. The price per bag is a little steep but better than regular Lays.
--------------------
Caution. These are as addictive! Very crunchy with just the right amount of salt. Not greasy at all. And the best part is they contain 40 percent less fat!
--------------------
These are the best ever me and my family really enjoy these they taste great and there not heavy in fat love them
--------------------
Good for a reduced fat chip. Chips have a good crisp. I still prefer the normal chips better.
--------------------
If you want crunch without the guilt this is it. Anytime we are hosting a party or just want to snack this is the product we pickup. We enjoy this product and always chose this brand over the others.
--------------------
These are crispy and delicious. I reach for these whenever I need a little crunch. They work for my diet plan and hello me feel satisfied.
--------------------
I can crunch away without the extra guilt knowing these are 40% less fat. I dip and they don’t break.
--------------------
If you’re looking for a healthier alternative to normal potato chips these are for you! I love kettle cooked chips and these are so great. They’re crunchy and have the perfect amount of salt. The bag is pretty durable and they don’t last a long time in my house!! I bring these with me when I’m on the go, a great value for the money too!
--------------------
Cape Cod chips are my go to chips above all others. Love the taste and the crunchiness of these chips and they are better for you. The price is affordable and I buy these chips all the time. My house is never without. I would absolutely recommend these chips to everyone!
--------------------
Lower Fat contact but same great taste as full fat. If u are looking for a crunchy salty snack—try these chips.
--------------------
These are the only chips I will buy! They are so crispy and loving that they are reduced fat (makes me feel a little less guilty when eating them lol)
--------------------
These are my favorite ever! They don't taste reduced fat in the slightest. I made a friend send me some when I lived on the west coast and couldn't get them locally
--------------------
I love potato chips and I wanted to give this brand a try. And to be honest, it’s addicting once you eat it. I just like the reduced fat one more because it makes me feel less guilty when I eat it lol. The only complaint I have is that it’s quite salty, even for a reduced fat one. Like a bit too salty for my tastebuds.
--------------------
This literally is the only chip I will purchase! So crisp and full of flavor, so satisfying without overdoing it on the salt and a bonus 40% reduced fat. Furthermore, this is the ultimate dipping chip. No need to worry about scooping up a dollop of dip and your chip breaking in half! This chip is the "Hefty" of all chips!
--------------------
I'm not too much of a chip person, but there are times when I get a craving. I bought these on a whim at the grocery store - it was on a rack right next to the checkstand. Oh yes, they saw a woman with no will power coming! Anyway, yummy, delicious, right amount of salty, and does not taste like it's lacking anything.
--------------------
I dont eat many chips but when i do this is the brand. The flavor is great and chips are crisp and crunchy. They a little bit lower in sodium then some other brands
--------------------
Taste like regular kettle potato chips but I never looked into why it’s “40% reduced fat”. Still not healthy.
--------------------
Absolutely amazing. They are a perfect crunch and just enough salt. They are absolutely addictive. They are my favorite chips.
--------------------
I love these chips. They taste good and they aren’t a lot of points for my weight Watchers
--------------------
Love cape cod chips and think these are even better than the regular! Crunchy and delicious.
--------------------
I like that these are less fat, but every bit as crunchy and tasty as ordinary potato chips. I feel a little less guilty.
--------------------
These are my favorite chips ever!!! I really love these chips sooo much especially because the sodium levels are so much lower than other brands of chips. I would definitely recommend this brand of chips!!
--------------------
These chips are delicious. They are not as salty as the original variety, but are still very tasty. This brand is better than the competition. Cape Cod chips exceeded my expectations.
--------------------
These chips had all the right amount of folded crunchy chips throughout the bag, didn’t have to “steal” them to get my fill. The price and amount in the bag was a great deal.
--------------------
My favorite kettle chip right now. Not so greasy and hold up extremely well to my other favorite...DIP!
--------------------
I honestly can’t tell the difference between the reduce fat and the original cape cod chips. The reduce fat tastes great. Low in salt which is a plus. Still light and airy with a great crunch. On the pricey side compared to other chip brands.
--------------------
I really love the flavor of these chips! You would never know that they are reduced fat. The crunch is intense. When I buy chips for myself to enjoy, these are the ones I buy. I feel Ike’s they are healthier too because ofmthr reduces fat.
--------------------
Buy the family size of this chip also. Nicely salted with the reduce fat. Taste delicious.
--------------------
These chips are relatively good, the flavor is lacking a bit but for reduced fat chips they’re tasty. They’re super crunchy and I don’t need to eat the entire bag to feel like I got my fill of chips. These are always in the cabinet for when I need a little bit of crunch.
--------------------
These chips are amazing they have the most crunch and the right amount of salt. They are good with any dip and the reduced fat version tastes just as good as the original version. These chips are always stocked at my house and I would recommend them to anyone.
--------------------
The chips are good with any of your favorite chip dips. It has a good flavor. I've gotten this kind of chips a couple of times. I haven't really thought about the health benefits. I recommend other people to try it.
--------------------
I love the freshness and crunch of these chips. You can not tell they are reduced fat. The taste is wonderful and it is worth the price.
--------------------
Love!! So crunchy and live that they are not greasy:) I wish they came in low salt and reduced fat:)
--------------------
The best potato chips! Low fat, not greasy at all! It met all of our expectations and still does. If I can't have them, I don't buy potato chips.
--------------------
Great for the beach or lunch snack!! These are a go to for a fun summer afternoon or a yummy snack for lunch!
--------------------
I love these chips. Lightly salted, light chip. I’m not a fan of kettle chips but these are to die for!
--------------------
As a new englander, cape cod chips are one of the best. We have a few native brands and these are the best.
--------------------
I love these chips. These are my go to for a kettle chip. The ingredients are all natural.
--------------------
These are my second favorite chip in the entire world! I loveeeee the reduced fat more than the original because I feel as if they are more baked, crunchier, and saltier. Great for snacks and with sandwiches!
--------------------
I loveee them! They’re light and super tasty!
--------------------
This is our favorite potato chip brand. It’s just a simple delicious potato chip and I like the natural kettle texture - my husband like ridged chips. These are amazing on they own or with any dip - always a crowd pleaser.
--------------------
I only buy kettle type chips. I like Kettle brand and they are in the top 3 of kettle chips. Excellent to eat with dip or hummus.
--------------------
All the different flavors of this brand are amazing. The original is just my favorite. They have the absolute perfect crunch. I love them more than regular potato chips, bc they're way too soft. I need the crunch of these chips. I recommend then to all!
--------------------
These taste great. Have a great crunch and perfect thickness. If you like a kettled cooked chip this is a must.
--------------------
A classic flavor of chip that is an asset to any party or bbq! You gotta love the amount of options kettle brand has! There’s no crunch quite like the crunch of the kettle chip! They have enough weight to hold a good dip too!
--------------------
I like these potatoes chips. I like kettle chips and these are one of my favorite brands. I love how these chips are Project Non-GMO Verified. In addition to being gluten free. I also love how there are no added ingredients or preservatives in this chips. I recommend this brand of potato chips.
--------------------
Too hard and was not a fan of the aftertaste. My garbage disposal of a husband finished them when even my children wouldn’t.
--------------------
These are so addicting and taste so much better than regular potato chips. More expensive but worth every penny.
--------------------
These a basic potato chips with a lot of crunch and flavor. I love how simple these are and they almost pair with anything you can throw together. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes potato chips.

--------------------
This is easily one of my favorite chips! They are slightly thicker than normal chips and crunchier. I love the texture of these chips!

--------------------
Very yummy chips!! You can get them at most store locations now. I’d definitely recommend!
--------------------
Love these for a classic sandwhich! Nice and crunchy with the perfect amount of salt.
--------------------
I like the more substantial crunch with these chips but eating too many in one sitting can result in a sore jaw. Plain sea salt flavour is great on its own or with some dip. These chips are thicker so they’re great for dipping!
--------------------
This is my favorite brand and I love the way these chips are made. We always keep a stock of these at home and they’re amazing
--------------------
I feel this is a great chip and has great flavor and the crunch is so good. They are a little bit higher then most but they have sells often
--------------------
Delicious chips. I would recommend

They also have a flavor that taste SO good! My entire family loves them! We buy them usually a couple times a month. Kettle Brand Sea Salt Potato Chips 93
--------------------
I love all kettle brand chips. Sea salt are my favorite. Not too salty. They are my go to snack
--------------------
I want to like these but I just don’t. They taste too but I don’t love the crunchy texture. A little too much crunch for me. If you like extra crunchy, kind of hard chips, these are for you. If not try something else.
--------------------
Just simple and delicious! Such a nice clean flavor too then, they go great with everything. Definitely recommend the whole brand as well!
--------------------
Crispy and not too crunchy like other brands of kettle chips with just the right amount of salty goodness I crave in a potato chip.
--------------------
I don’t really like anything about these chips, they taste funny and smell weird there are other brands that taste way better. I wouldn’t recommend.
--------------------
My favorite chips. I happen to prefer the kettle cooked chips because of their special crunchiness. Great for dipping as they’re strong

This is the best chips around. It is perfect crispy and very well salt balanced . I recommend it in any partir.

--------------------
these are my fave kettle chips! i don’t like a ton of crazy flavors, i just stick to my tried and true sea salt. this brand is above and beyond any others i’ve tried before. will continue to purchase always!
--------------------
Crunchy and salty .. could have a little more flavor but not overly greasy like some other chip brands. Easy to find in stores
--------------------
This is the absolute BEST potato chip out there. It has the PERFECT crunch factor. You can have them with or without dip and they are divine either way!!!!
--------------------
Really enjoy eating kettle sea salt chips with my sandwich’s because it gives it a nice salty and crunchy addition! Not as salty as other chips which I like and it’s very tasty
--------------------
FAVORITE! So love these kettle chips. They are so crunchy but they are a little bit on the salty side
--------------------
These are always a winner for your basic potato chip. They are very crunchy and salty. I just wish they came in a bigger bag more readily available. The ingredients are basic which is always a plus.￼
--------------------
These are a good classic chip. They are thick so perfect for dipping. They won’t be the chips that break off in the dip!
--------------------
My favorite chips. I really like the crunchy texture of these chips. I’m these work great as well for dips and on there own.
--------------------
i haven’t tried the brand kettle but if you have never tried kettle corn chips you NEED to pick them up at your local grocery store. i only like the original and maybe salt vinegar is kinda good but none of my family likes salt and vinegar so i think you should try regular ones
--------------------
I love the flavor and crisp of this chip. It is definitely a great chip for dips or just eat with a sandwich!
--------------------
Greatly cooked. Kettle cooked makes them crunchy and very good. All flavors are great. Yummy chips!
--------------------
Great chip. Super crunchy!! Eat on the side of your sandwich or add to your sandwich for an extra crunch!! Very salty, proceed with caution and water. Highly recommend trying!
--------------------
Kettle brand chips are by far the best chip on the market. All of their flavors are true to flavor but the crunch of their chips is superior. Always super crunchy and always just what I need
--------------------
I really like the flavor of these chips. My only complaint is that I feel like they “go bad” after some time in the cupboard. Almost soggy tasting. They are good when first opened and for about a week. But after that I can taste a definite decline
--------------------
Super crunchy with some saltiness to taste! Great with a nice Sprite or tea! Super delicious, never disappointing! I could never try to improve this product! 10/10 will buy again!
--------------------
These are my favorite chips if I want one that I don’t need a dip with! Perfect crunch and great flavor. We do prefer the ones made with avocado oil and wish that they were all made with that instead of others, but none the less, it’s delicious!
--------------------
My aunt would always get these for parties and i realized i would eat so much of them! i’m now hooked on them i always buy them when i go grocery shopping. They taste so good and aren’t as salty as other chips!!
--------------------
Honestly can’t go wrong with this brand of chips. I LOVE chips. I will always bring a bag of chips with me backpacking, even if it extra weight or space. It’s so worth it and they taste that much better after a long hike.
--------------------
When I do eat chips these are my go to! They are light and crunchy and over all good taste.
--------------------
I love that Kettle brand ships are nice and crunchy and dont feel as greasy as regular potato chips. Favorite kettle chip brand by far.
--------------------
These are my go to chips! Love the crunch and flavor ... they’re not super salty either.
--------------------
Love these chips it's my go to brand. They are crispy And salty in the perfect way. I love all the different flavors but regular salted is my favorite. It's a chip so you can't expect a super food but it is an healthier option for a chip.
--------------------
These are so tasty. They are crunchy and salty flavored goodness. They pair perfectly with sandwiches and are great for snacks at a bbq. My kids always ask for these and we have them at almost every grown up party.
--------------------
I love the flavor of these chips and I love the fact that they’re pretty thick so they are very crunchy which is enjoyable.
--------------------
These chips are super delicious! They're kettle cooked so they're completely different than other brands of standard potato chips.
--------------------
These are a great snack and perfect to have out at parties. The price is very good and it’s always a crowd pleaser
--------------------
Kettle brand makes the best Kettle type of chips that I have ever found. Love the natural sea salt flavor not as overwhelming as other salty chips
--------------------
I’m not a huge fan of overly crunchy hard chips and on top of being super crunchy these also felt very greasy compared to Ruffles or other brands. Would not purchase again.
--------------------
These potatoe chips are so thick and crispy. I love them! These chips give me the least acne since they're less oily. They're not too salty. They look like Lays but thicker and tastes better. I like when potatoe chips are thick and crispy rather than light and airy. I recommend you try these!
--------------------
This is probably my favorite brand of potato chips at the store because they aren’t very salty and their food quality. They are very crunchy and their really good. Instead of biting the cheap chips these are a much better quality.
--------------------
My absolute favorite chips definitely crisp crunchy and delicious without overpowering flavors simple but good
--------------------
Kettle chips that have the perfect amount of crunch in every bite! Great size of chips, much larger chip size than Cape Cod brand.
--------------------
My fave potato chip because it has the perfect crisp and perfect thickness. Not too thin not too thick
--------------------
I usually do not eat potato chips due to the ingredients. Did you know that if you check the label of your chips you will see that there is a lot of stuff you can't even pronounce. Also, there is meat in chips. Which is why I don't eat them. But, If i do, I prefer to eat the kettle chips.
--------------------
These are a very crunchy, crisp, and delicious chips! They’re so crunchy that you practically can’t hear anything going on around you haha which I love! Perfect and sturdy for dips. The bag is really nice and thick which is great for keeping humidity out.
--------------------
These are so good. They’re my go to snack in the afternoon or with a sandwich. It’s just a perfect snack and who doesn’t love potato chips. They are so crispy and tasty!
--------------------
Love the texture of these chips, very crunchy! Only problem I could think of for these is that they are on the oily side
--------------------
The best chips for dipping as they don’t snap in half while you dip. Thicker cut and very flavorful. Great alone or with any side.
--------------------
Kettle brand chips are delicious! They are super super crispy, so don't try to eat them while watching TV or trying to have a conversation. It's impossible.
--------------------
Good, solid, stable potato chip. These can get a little greasy, but it’s what keeps it so flavorful.￼ I don’t know if it’s the distribution, but I find this bag of chips pairs so perfectly with a sandwich.￼
--------------------
So these chips are soooo goood!!! Crunchy and flavorful. I would buy these over most other brands
--------------------
These kettle chips add boss and out Cape Cod to shame! I discovered them years ago at a gas station and ever since, I buy them in bulk at times because they are so addicting, ohh the sea salt is to die for and the crispy kettle crunch, YUM!
--------------------
These are a nice thick Kettle chip. I like plain salted Kettle chips. These aren't necessarily my first chip choice, but if they are around and I eat some I enjoy them.
--------------------
I love these! They’re not too salty, just the right amount and perfect for a little snack
--------------------
I buy these chips as a "special treat". They are just as good as some of the more expensive brands and taste just as good. It's very hard to eat only a handful! They are worth the money and I highly recommend them. I have tried other flavors, but the regular sea salt flavor is my favorite.
--------------------
Sea salt is the best chip out there! I love them. It’s the crunchy in the chip plus the taste of sea salt. It’s great.
--------------------
Believe it or not back when I was younger and I used to smoke pot this was my absolute favorite stoners snack. These and a can of coke while I surfed the web lol
--------------------
I love these! They are the ultimate snack food. Kettle chips are our regular Crisps at home. Great with any type of dip and tasty on their own.I do prefer them with my bean dip though. I find them to be quite thicker and also much crispier than a lot of crisps on the market. They have the perfect amount of seasoning and crunch. Kettle Brand Sea Salt Chips are a very flavorful snack and very healthy for a low price.
--------------------
Yummy and fast delivery
--------------------
Flavorless. Bland. Boring. Lay's Kettle are 100% better in every way.
--------------------
These are my favorite plain potato chips! I love them because they are so salty, crispy and delicious. Kettle chips are thicker which gives them the bear crunch! I will usually serve these at parties. So good!
--------------------
Love these! This is a great brand and I will continue to repurchase. Love the variety of flavors.
--------------------
I love the crunchiness and that these chips are not as salty as similar chips from other leading brands. Worth buying!
--------------------
I have been trying to find the perfect potato chips but this are not the ones! Sadly they are too Greasy they are non GMO but the rest is like Humm too greasy for me! Will keep looking.
--------------------
The sea salt flavor is a great subtle flavor that I love! These are great chips to pair with other foods or have at a party because I find they are universal favorites!
--------------------
Delicious. Innutritious. The perfect crunch. Good price. Maybe a little too oily but I’m sure that lends back to the delicious factor.
--------------------
These are my favorite child of all time. They are perfectly crunchy, greasy, salty and delicious. I love to add them to a sandwich for some extra crunch or just snack on them.
--------------------
These chips are great. Relatively thin cut. Perfect amount of salty (great for a salty food craving). Crispy and satisfying. Never super greasy or oily. If I want a potato chip, these are 100% my go to snack! Highly recommend these! Their other flavors are great too.
--------------------
Really good flavor and texture. The perfect crisp and crunch. Kettle Brand is my favorite brand of chips and the sea salt is perfect for when you don’t want an overload of flavor. Definitely would recommend these to anyone who likes crispier/crunchier chips.
--------------------
My only complaint is that these are a little too expensive to justify buying the regularly. But they taste great. They’re also super crunchy, so they’re perfect to sneak into the movie theater so you can be “that guy” if you want.
--------------------
I love kettle chips! I can sit and eat a whole bag at one time. Love the sea salt too
--------------------
These are seriously the best! The chips are so crunchy and have the perfect amount of salt. I always make sure to have a bowl of these out for parties or for picnics! They also go so well with sandwiches- anything, really.
--------------------
The Kettle chips have the perfect salt to chip ratio. While I feel they’re too crunchy, for many people, that’s exactly what they love them.
--------------------
These are the best chips I've ever had in my life.
--------------------
These chips are some of my favorite! I love the thick, salty, greas-ness of it all. They’re perfect the way they are! Easy to find and relatively cheap.
--------------------
I love some plain potato chips. These ones are very good and the salt adds a flavor to the chips.
--------------------
Super crunchy and salty but made with good ingredients and healthier than regular potato chips
--------------------
This chips flavor cannot be beat as it is truly the best tasting one in comparison to its other brands. Just to put things into perspective, which brand of ketchup to restaurants tend to use always :)
--------------------
Good variety to satisfy everyone.
--------------------
Cute packaging. Chips good as usual, and good size bags.
--------------------
My grand daughter loved them

Lots of snacks, great price.

Always a favorite, and great for snack, lunch addition, or for having something to put on your stomach when taking meds. We love the new little notes on the bags recently!
--------------------
Family choices in individual sizes.
--------------------
Chips were all smashed
--------------------
Good variety but it seem like the Fritos is all ways the last to go!!!
--------------------
reasonably priced and good variety
--------------------
Great variety pack for camping.

--------------------
Perfect size for Thanksgiving! Everyone loves Lays!! Easy to eat with multiple types of dips!
--------------------
Love the consistency from this brand!
--------------------
Thanks for carrying this item! My granddaughters favorite item and love it's in a snack bag so it's just enough to have.
--------------------
My favorite chips for salsa dipping
--------------------
Tasted like good old lays
--------------------
Perfect for road trips or hikes, when the kids jut need something to crunch on. The portions are good too, because I never want to give them big amounts of snacks.
--------------------
My favorite plain chip to go with any dip
--------------------
delicious and classic
--------------------
I love Lay's Classic Potatoes Chips. I bought them when there was a really good deal on the amount I was getting (if I chose the Pickup option). I'm very satisfied I got these chips.
--------------------
Seems Lays is getting cheap as less than half of the bag was filled! Paid a heck of a lot for a bag of air. Very disappointing.
--------------------
The chips were opened, am so disappointed.
--------------------
Great potato chips! Our go to for snacking!
--------------------
My favorite 'nuff said.  Best traditional potato chip on the market.
--------------------
Always fresh and usual on sale. Love these chips. Light and crispy
--------------------
You can’t eat just one. Delicious as always.
--------------------
Great product at a low price.  Perfect for sharing, everyone gets their own little bag.
--------------------
These are my all time favorite potato chips! Always great tasting! Great crunch! Great value! Always fresh! I didn't have many potato chips stocked up in my pantry. Why would I? Whenever I ran low of my favorite chips I could always just run up to the grocery store to get more. Then the pandemic hit. I searched online but most stores had run out of Lays classic potato chips. I tried Target online and there they were! I ordered several bags immediately. They arrived at my house just a few days later and with free shipping! These are great chips at a great price! Thank you Target for having our backs during these trying times. While most other stores have run out of the most popular products, Target has plenty and are ready to have them at your doorstep within days AND with free shipping! That can't be beat. Thank you Target! You rock! Great product! Great taste! Perfect crunch!
--------------------
Very poor packaging. All of my item where shipped together with cans. Of course that means the bags were busted and crumbled chips..
--------------------
Lay's has been a household staple ever since I was a kid! I love this 12 count bag so that there is some self-control in my home! The chips are not all crumbled and just enough. It's something about opening a bag of deliciousness and finishing it and that is why I choose the singles versus the big bag. The only complaint I have is that I wish that the Lovely Lay's would not use vegetable oil and switch to expeller-pressed so that us Lay's lovers could indulge more frequently without the sunflower/corn or canola oil.
--------------------
So yum! My fam loves
--------------------
I like this size because they’re so good I’m tempted to eat a whole bag of  the larger sizes!
--------------------
I acquired these in the store. The package had one of the little face things on them so I could take a funny picture for my Facebook account. But I received no face and I am mad. Still tasted good though
--------------------
these are the best chips and they have simple ingredients.
--------------------
chips were smashed into crumbs.
--------------------
Even though we have only 2 in our family, this is the only size we will buy.....and even then they don't last very long! Tired of cheaper brands which are usually stale, greasy and either over or under salted. Lay's always comes through with the perfect chip, and as a topping make my casseroles super crunchy and delicious with my homemade dips! They arrived in perfect condition with plenty of bubble wrap, which I recycle. Thanks Target!!
--------------------
The bag was open with half of the chips in the box.
--------------------
Half of the bag I ordered came opened because they push too hard on the bags when they are packing them.
--------------------
arrived crushed in box, nothing but crumbs.
--------------------
It arrived in a very good item in a well-packaged box, no crushed chips. Target is very professional in shipping.
--------------------
The lays classic chips is the best chips one can ever have...
--------------------
Always consistent with taste.
--------------------
Yummy!!l love the chips and texture
--------------------
Great item great price
--------------------
Best chips with or without dip!
--------------------
It seems like the big is holding less and less chips... I love this for a salty treat!
--------------------
Delicious chips. Our families’ favorite
--------------------
Classic potato chip, only decision is wavy, rippled, flat, toppings, dips, what's the main course, did you pack the napkins? Where is the next gas station for more...
--------------------
Always a great chip! good price.  I did drive-up in the App and the bag wasn't crushed.
--------------------
These chips are as wavy as I expected. The contents did settle, however the packaging did indicate that would happen. I appreciate the honesty and the guaranteed fresh commitment. I do not usually eat potato chips, but they chips did bring me joy. Keep up the good work.
--------------------
These potato chips are great! I ate almost a whole bag in one sitting
--------------------
Not greasy, very tasty, always crispy and not a bad bag yet.
--------------------
Very Tasty chips.........

--------------------
So good, Pringles never disappoints - however, regret not getting the sour cream and onion too!!
--------------------
We bought these a few months ago for a change. Now we can eat the whole can in one setting!
--------------------
pringles is really tasty and great to share with family and friends, the bad thing is there's too much salt
--------------------
I buy pringles every time I go shopping me and my kids love them
--------------------
I hate ordering Pringles from Target because they always come broken, just a can of crumbs. But it saves me going out during this pandemic!!!
--------------------
We buy more cans of pringles than we'd like to admit. But they have such a great taste.
--------------------
I have eaten this since I was a child. Now I shre with my children. Just the right amount of saltiness and crisp. Can't go wrong with an Original.
--------------------
Nice flavor. Not too salty. Good value.
--------------------
It was 1973 in Chicago on a trip when my taste buds started a love affair with Pringles. I had never tasted such a wonderful flavor from a crisped potato and stacked uniformly in a can no less. I live in California and it took over a year for Pringles to arrive. Now I can select from a variety of flavors which I can combine to further excite my taste buds.
--------------------
I simply love these chips. Easy to keep fresh because of the lid
--------------------
Crumbs. Both cans that I ordered were crumbs. I will return to my previous source, at least they arrive intact.
--------------------
I bought them and they were all gone the same day. Wished I had bought two cans.
--------------------
i love pringles .there good and coming in good favors .eazy to caring with you to pack for going out for the day .and ther cheaper than bag chips
--------------------
Great chips tast great easy to eat. Not messy reasable priced.
--------------------
Love the shaped and it crispy. Not too salty just right. It’s a great dehydrated chip. Great for travel.
--------------------
Love my Pringles! They've been imitated by other brands, but the original Pringles is the best. Looking for the right thickness, salt, flavor? Here. Buy other Pringles flavors/styles for variety, but always come back to the Original for true Pringles experience.
--------------------
Perfectly crispy great taste and fun to eat! Holds together with dip
--------------------
Always a vacation trip staple. Great for the road and the mini cans allow everyone their own.
--------------------
I bought them for a snack as I sat and watched TV with my mom. We ended up eating them all.
--------------------
I’ve been eating about one can of Pringles a week for the last year
--------------------
Light potato crisp, not oily, easy to eat, tasty with just amount of salt.
--------------------
My Husband is Happy Verry Muach to snack \^_^/ I am happy to enjoy this food, until we enjoy it with my wife.
--------------------
I got an email asking me to review my latest purchase. Specifically the pringles. I don’t know why Pringles need to be reviewed. They’ve been the same for the 30+ years I’ve eaten them. Pros: Uniformity of chip is a thing of beauty, tubes are superior to bags, mustaches in 2020 are a brave choice, too salty. Cons: Uniformity of chips is fascist, tubes are too small for my huge gross mitt hands, mustaches are creepy in 2020, too salty. Verdict: Yo, this stuff is like 2 bucks a tube. Just try it for yourself. I hope this review has helped you in your quest for the perfect chip.
--------------------
I love Pringle’s. They taste so delicious and crisp. I love how thin and salted they taste. I usually get the original kind. Pringle lover.
--------------------
love the taste and the crunch. Tried the waveys and prefer the originals.
--------------------
These tasted delicious!
--------------------
Pringles Grab & Go's are the perfect size for travel, snacking, and a quick treat. We love all the Pringles flavors; Grab & Go gives everyone the opportunity to have the variety they want at the same time when we're traveling or engaging in outdoor activities (hiking, picnicking, etc.)/taking a break on a day trip/visit. They're compact and easy to carry. It's the same great taste in a convenient package size!
--------------------
Pringles are a favorite in our house. We love the taste and crunch. They are great for on the go, as a busy mom that is a plus in my book. Pringles never disappoints.
--------------------
we fight over who gets to pop the new can! No matter what state you live in; Pringles never disappoints
--------------------
My daughter and I buy this product at least 4 times a month in doubles. Nothing beats the original taste of Original Pringles. Sure fancy flavors and bold tastes are good. But once you poo open the freshness seal and get the aroma of the original chips( trust us,there is one.lol) you can't help but to share the salty goodness of Original Pringles. 4 thumbs way up.
--------------------
Pringle’s are the best!
--------------------
I buy the original flavor because it goes with any sandwich.
--------------------
I Buy Because ,They Are Always Whole Chips.Easy To Take In Lunch Box.
--------------------
Love Pringles. So tasty and crunchy and delicious.
--------------------
My family loves Pringles and you can never go wrong with the original flavor!
--------------------
I bought this a year ago and I loved all features of these Pringles. So crispy and crunchy.
--------------------
I bought one tube and enjoyed them so I went back and bought another
--------------------
This is always our go to chip. I'm not a chip person, but when I get that salty craving this is the only way to go.
--------------------
I just opened my package of Pringles,,,it was only a little over half-full and the chips have No Salt!! It says Original on the tube.Unless they have changed their recipe,I think I got 'shystered'. ""C'mon Pringles!!""
--------------------
We love to sit around eat Pringles while watching movie. We love game night and family and friends sharing these
--------------------
Love the crispiness of each bite! Always look forward to having Pringles!
--------------------
My 8YO is really picky. He tried pringles because of what ever was on the can. He was impressed! He even shares them with his sister who does not eat chips or snacks like that. Whatever it is about Pringles they like them. I like that there are not a thousand chips per container so we can easily limit their intake. I remember having pringles as a go to snack for hiking and camping and now my kids can enjoy the same convenience!
--------------------
Love these Pringle’s variety pack they are so handy and great
--------------------
Pringles are our favorite snack! We love the pizza flavor.
--------------------
I love how oringles can their chips....rarly broken
--------------------
I prefer the plain. You can't stop eating them. Too good to eat only a few.
--------------------
Our hole family loves Pringles we all eat them and even love the less salt
--------------------
The original ones are always fresh and tasty. Great product
--------------------
I bought original because the market was out of lightly salted. I find the original too salty.
--------------------
I’m a fan. Have been since I was a kid. Pringles help keep my hands clean and are usually mostly intact.
--------------------
I enjoy the Pringles® The Original Love the Great Taste .It's hard just to eat just one!
--------------------
Pringle’s you cant go wrong and I got them on sale which was a great deal!
--------------------
I bought a original pringles and tried it but it has zero salt? i´ve always had the red one and no problems but i´ve never had the red one with no salt.. it tastes like nothing :/
--------------------
Easy to store for long car trips! My toddlers go to
--------------------
I lime the other flavors, but they are no match for the original
--------------------
Whatever it is that you're eating, the Original flavor of the product is usually the best tasting. Pringles Original flavor is no exception! I also buy several of the other flavors, because my family enjoys eating those, as well. Yet still, Pringles Original are the most difficult for me to keep stocked up on in our snack cabinet. Those are the favorite that always seems to disappear the quickest! That's why I always buy extra Pringles Original flavor! Nothing beats the Original! Although, some of the other flavors come close! ❤
--------------------
After not having Pringles in a while, I am sooooo glad I came back to YOU!
--------------------
You have done something to The recipe it doesn’t Taste the same or look the same. Bring back the original pringles
--------------------
Not much to say about these, other than they taste very flavorless and plain. I get it, they are Pringles, but these Original ones are not on the top of my list for go-to Pringles flavors. They are not horrible, but they are not that great either. Overall, I would not recommend these.
--------------------
crispy and not too salty. Nice container. chips stay in 1 piece.
--------------------
We are loyal customer of Pringles, they go great with sandwiches or alone as a snack with or without a dip!! We love the Original, Sour Cream & Chive, Cheee flavors the most but am certain the other flavors are great as well!!
--------------------
My husband goes thru these like candy and he loves candy
--------------------
I love pringles. they are so light that if I am not careful I can eat the entire can in one sitting. I take out a stack of 10 and they satisfy my cravings for salty and crispy.
--------------------
We enjoyed eating our Pringles. We finished the whole can in one sitting! We forgot how much fun it was.
--------------------
Always love Pringles for snack. I'd love a T-shirt from your store, although I've never seen one.
--------------------
Me and my family have always enjoyed snacking on Pringles Potato chips, they are quite crunchy and tasty.
--------------------
Tossed it in my cart, squished it into the bag and still had great whole chips to serve the family.
--------------------
Pringles are an easy snack to take along with me. My kids love them
--------------------
Ive been buying and eating pringles for several years-absolutely love them!!! Keep a canister handy to eat with my choclates!!!
--------------------
This none greasy teats keeps you heathy and satify any craving
--------------------
I have always enjoy Pringle’s. You can’t eat just one
--------------------
Pringles have become a staple in our house and they are usually yummy. However, the last cans I bought had no salt. Didn?t taste good at all and was very disappointing.
--------------------
I love Pringles Original. They have just the right amount of salt. I tried the lightly salted ones and was disappointed. I will be sticking to Pringles Original
--------------------
We really love the fact that all chips are whole and there are very few broken pieces and crumbs in the can.
--------------------
We have 7 children and one of our favorites is original pringles with chocolate pudding using the chip to scoop the pudding. so good
--------------------
The chips themselves seem to have gotten much thinner and fragile as there is much more breakage in the canisters.
--------------------
I brought these last month and they are good to eat anytime & anywhere
--------------------
One of the go to snacks around this house due to the great flavor.
--------------------
I'm a Potato Chip lover and I must say that I love Pringles the best because they're always nice and crunchy and have a consistent flavor
--------------------
BOUGHT ABOUT A MONTH AGO. BUY THEM ALOT. NOT AS GREASY AS THE BAG CHIPS.
--------------------
I love the slightly salty potato flavor. neutral goes with everything. I remember when they came out when I was a kid. Who would've guessed so many flavors were in the works...
--------------------
I bought these and I bought different flavored ones. My son loves the pizza flavored one and I always make sure I get the original ones for myself
--------------------
Love undamaged chips! Salty and crunchy is the perfect snack for me.
--------------------
I have tasted this item & they are plain & boring. I may as well have been eating cardboard.
--------------------
It has been awhile since I had Pringles, but I bought the Originals last week and loved them. They were crispy and tasty right down to the last one.
--------------------
Can't beat the original flavor pringles. Still our favorite after all these years
--------------------
my family has always loved Pringles. The thing I like about them is they are so lunch box friendly. I have several " pringles shaped" containers the company put out a few years ago and these are at great space saving. The pringles stay intact, there's no pile of chip crumbs by lunchtime like the bags of other chips. Each pringle packs in great flavor, great crunch, and one chip is the perfect mouthful!
--------------------
I like snacking on pringles original chips sometimes
--------------------
I love Pringles they are the best ! I enjoy any flavor of them.
--------------------
What a great snack! Pringles have be a favorite in our household for many years - crunchy and delicious! The only problem is eating the whole can at once!
--------------------
Crunchy, salty, delicious goodness that never goes out of style.
--------------------
Pringles add just the right amount of crunch to a meal. I eat them when I have hot dogs, sandwiches, hamburgers etc.
--------------------
I bought Pringles Original expecting great flavor and fresh crispness and was not disappointed on either account.
--------------------
great texture and flavor; consistently delicious!!
--------------------
I love to take pringles on a road trip, don't have to worry about spills and crushed chips.
--------------------
My family loves pringles! They?re easy to pack in lunches and not messy or greasy like other chips!
--------------------
I enjoy pringles as a snack any day any time. My go to is original or low sodium
--------------------
So Great! Love this and my kids absolutely love them too.
--------------------
I buy these chips frequently. I like the taste. They are crunchy and salty-the perfect combination. I can manage how many I take. They are perfect for lunches or snacks at home.
--------------------
Easy picnic food, easy to carry chips don't get crushed and the lid keeps pests out. The chips still have the great flavor from when I was a child.
--------------------
These chips are full of cheesy yumminess!
--------------------
Delicious what else can I say!
--------------------
Love these when you a tsty treat
--------------------
Neato... very much neato.
--------------------
I love these chips! The cheddar taste and sour cream combined so yummy. I have been craving this constantly throughout my pregnancy and it was one of the only things I was able to stomach while having morning sickness. It will continue to be one of my favorite snacks.
--------------------
One of my favorite chips.
--------------------
I thought these would taste great, and I do love ruffles chips, but I really did not like these at all. I gave the bag to my mom and she thought they were great, so at least they didn't go to waste. I really like the plain ruffles for sour cream and onion dip, or the ruffles sour cream and onion flavor, but this flavor just wasnt for me at all.
--------------------
Cheddar and sour cream is my favorite chip flavor. Lay's also has the same flavor and it is delicious also. But Ruffles is amazing and gives a good satisfying crunch
--------------------
These chips are so delicious, I paired them with spinach dip while my kids ate straight from the bag! Put some in a Tupperware and It was even a perfect snack for on the go. Crunchy and tasty ruffles cheddar and sour cream chips is a definitely a must have!
--------------------
Yummy snack!!  The chips were crisp and the taste was great!
--------------------
So far this is the best potato chips ever, perfect cheddar and sour cream flavor, so crispy.
--------------------
we all love it and good value
--------------------
It is what it looks like: a large bag of several smaller bags. Chips and similar.
--------------------
My kids love this variety pack!
--------------------
Nice variety. Good price.
--------------------
Good snack for kids.
--------------------
Bought these for family to eat ended up eating all of them haha. Great variety the only one I didn’t like was the Fritos I could have done without those
--------------------
Perfect for individual snacks in kid’s Lunches or at a covid responsible get together !
--------------------
Perfect for my son's lunches.
--------------------
Nice variety for Halloween treats, and the leftovers for lunches! Perfect for portion control too!
--------------------
Exactly what I expected
--------------------
Perfect for kids that are always needing a snack. Easy
--------------------
Easy and convenient packaging for my little ones!
--------------------
Good for after school snack
--------------------
Perfect for on the go snacks
--------------------
I am glad Target has this variety bag of chips for purchase.
--------------------
It expired. How are these bags still
On the shelf. I’m upset because I do appreciate the convenience of Target. I never thought to check the expiration date until I got home.
--------------------
I wish that I could give a "0" rating.  I usually purchase my bulk chips from another vendor, but I gave Target a chance this time..... Why would you send an online customer a STALE package full of snacks?  Even though the expiration date is 9 weeks away, anyone who purchases and eats chips KNOWS that they will be STALE by the expiration date.  I read reviews that stated the same thing but I didn't heed their advice, what a mistake!!!
--------------------
Love the Flavor Mix! It has a great selection of individual bags, perfect for lunches and snacks.
--------------------
This variety pack does not contain spicy nacho doritos as advertised, it contains the regular nacho cheese doritos. I placed an online order and my items were already bagged up when I got there. I didn't notice until I made it home and unpacked my bags.
--------------------
These are much better than Lays and other name brands!
--------------------
Lacks flavor and taste
--------------------
These are so good! Not greasy but very crunchy.
--------------------
These chips are kettle cooked. They are very crunchy and lots of folded chips. Not for dipping. Just a great crispy, crunchy chip for snacking or a party.
--------------------
very good price and chip
--------------------
So so good! That have a great crunch, delicious flavor, and are so addicting. Good price too.
--------------------
Absolutely delicious kettle chips and you can’t beat the price! Love to find a Target brand product that’s amazing!
--------------------
It's so good and cheap! Would definitely choose this over the branded ones. It's just as good but half the price.
--------------------
I was pleasantly surprised! I got these for my husband and he loved them.
--------------------
I was looking for something similar to the chips Panera makes, and I found them! They’re soooooo good!
--------------------
Delicious potato chips. This is a reorder because we like them so much!
--------------------
Delicious! Reminds me of those other pricier Kettle chips i love.  Perfectly seasoned.
--------------------
These are quite tasty and cheap too!
--------------------
Love the taste and thickness of these chips, also the fact they’re gluten free. Use to like Lay’s chips, but these are so much better.  Good price too.
--------------------
These chips are great! Really crunchy, good flavor, not too salty or greasy.
--------------------
Wow! These chips are delicious. Waiting for new flavors.
--------------------
Good crunchy. Good flavor. Just as good as premium kettle chips. Brilliant re-closing zipper, so don’t tear the packet open in the normal way, or you won’t be able to use it.
--------------------
Decided to give these a try and am very pleased. Fresh, flavorful and crunchy with not too much salt.
--------------------
they taste like most other potato chips, never had a problem. Definitely a healthier option than most other chips out there.

also the bag is resealable on its own... take notes, frito lay.
--------------------
The store was handing out samples with coupon and they tasted good so be bought a bag. When we tried the chips at home they tasted like plastic or maybe like the bag it came in? Expiration wasn’t for another month, so no sure why they were so disgusting.
--------------------
Less salt, same great taste
--------------------
best. light salt chip!
--------------------
They taste great! I didn't even noticed that they were low sodium.
--------------------
Has enough salt but not overly salty.
--------------------
Lays make the best potato chips
--------------------
These are great! Only potato chip we buy!
--------------------
This is the best tasting chip, we all should be watching our sodium intake. This is the answer. Thank you Lays
--------------------
Much better than original, but would be even better with even less salt.
--------------------
THE BOMB! I love these chips! They taste light? Lol idk if that makes sense but they’re just really good
--------------------
BEST CHIPS EVER! I don’t know how I enjoyed any regular chips before! Lightly salted is the way to go! If you’re like me and like to eat half a bag while questioning your life late at night, then these are for you! Try them, you won’t regret it!
--------------------
Actually we like them much better than the regular Lays. They have more of a potato flavor.
--------------------
The perfect amount of salt and still so tasty!
--------------------
I love these chips! They are crispy and light, salted enough for flavor but without extreme saltiness. Not greasy. Just perfect.
--------------------
These low sodium chips are really good, the regular Lays chips are very salty, so these are a good alternative when to much salt is a no, no.
--------------------
I love getting these as oppose to the regular lays because they are less salty and taste just as good as the original ones.
--------------------
THE BEST PART OF BUYING LAYS, THEY ARE NEVER CRUMBLED. THEY COME FRESH AND IN THE ORIGINAL FORM IT WAS MEANT TO BE. (COMPETITIVE WITH OTHERS!!)
I AM GOING TO TRY GROCERIES AND HOPE  THE EXPERIENCE IS SIMILAR, OR BETTER!!  THANK YOU TARGET, FOR HELPING THE

--------------------
Cheaper than lays and a better taste in my opinion
--------------------
Taste great not salty has crunch
--------------------
They taste as good as the lays. They’re not greasy at all. Good snack alone or with some deep sauce.
--------------------
Was kinda worried about getting a bag a crumbs having chips shipped but the chips arrived in beautiful shape. As good as Lays for sure.
--------------------
2 of my potato chips bag were smash
--------------------
The chips are large, and the taste is good, but the "Classic" chips are sprinkled with too much salt. This is my only complaint about these.
--------------------
BUY THESE CHIPS!  i was worried they wouldn't taste the same as lays but honestly they taste amazing, theres a big price difference and since we're quarantined ill be doing a lot of bbq's so very great taste for the price super excited!
--------------------
Love these chips!  They aren't over salty and they are crisp and cheap!!  Keep  up the good work Target!!!
--------------------
The chips are the perfect thickness and crispness, but they could use a little more salt. Other than that, they're still good.
--------------------
There's not much to say about these. They taste just like the name brand. You're definitely not losing out on flavor choosing this store brand. Recommend especially because you can get more and spend less without less taste. Since I throw a lot of parties that's a win win.
--------------------
I normally don’t purchase the store brand food products, but these potato chips are incredible. Just the right saltiness for my liking. I’ll definitely purchase these when I go to Target next time.
--------------------
These chips are fresh, crunchy and tasty. Would definitely recommend.
--------------------
I am a potato chip fanatic and these chips are so good. They were not overly salty, but just right. They are affordable and make me feel good about my purchase for me and my family. You will not be disappointed!
--------------------
I really like this chips, I usually eat it with a Turkey sandwich on my break and is really delicious .they break easily and the chips are a little bit oily but that is not a problem Also good with sour cream dip.i highly recommend it
--------------------
The chips are too oily. Most of the chips inside are small pieces.
--------------------
So yummy chips. Gone in 10minutes! These were crispy and crunchy. The salt content was optimum and there was no oily smell. The bag was full with chips and not just air. These were so tasty, we finished these in just few minutes. Great for snacking alone or with any dip.
--------------------
I served these chips at a party, and no one could tell they were an off brand. They aren't too salty, very crisp, good quality.
--------------------
I tried these chips and they are pretty good compared to the name brand. They didn't have as much salt as I think they should have. I would buy them again since I am on a budget.
--------------------
Love these , very tasty and not salty
--------------------
chips where all broken was basically crumbs
--------------------
love it my favorite so good
--------------------
Chips! These were as expected.
--------------------
You can't go wrong with these chips. They are delicious!
--------------------
These are the best sour cream and onion potato chips.
--------------------
These are my favorite flavored Lays chips. I can eat the whole bag in one sitting (which I probably shouldn't do).
--------------------
Classic combo. Freshly delivered right to you. Will be ordering again.
--------------------
LOVE ALL LAYS CHIPS PRODUCTS
--------------------
These are the best chips I have ever tasted. I ate the entire bag and was so ashamed of myself I bought another bag via in-store pickup in order to get them quick enough to stow them in my pantry before my roommate could get home and see the evidence of my gluttony.
--------------------
I love Lays no matter the kind of flavor.
--------------------
Best BBQ chips ever!!!
--------------------
My favorite chips , always fresh and hard to eat just a handful
--------------------
The bag wasn’t crushed
--------------------
Great tasting....light snack
--------------------
Taste, freshness, packaging!!
--------------------
i love Lays BBQ chips, but they don't seem ti have as much bbq on them these days. Still like them but wish they had more like before.
--------------------
I got a email saying this item was recalled and to discard it and did not get a refund
--------------------
Chips were all crumbs
--------------------
Number 1 best bbq chip
--------------------
I Just love the way they taste
--------------------
loved the flavor...one of my fav!!
--------------------
Tasted just like what a barbecue chip should taste like.
--------------------
I had this shipped and it was placed in a box with some heavy items. It arrived flat as a pancake. I know chips are hard to ship....maybe they should be made "not ship-able."
--------------------
Shipped well.  The food is great and this flavor is one of the best there is.
--------------------
TRY DIPPING IN MUSTARD! Your welcome!
--------------------
The package was damaged on the corner and the chips was out into the box.
--------------------
Lay's Barbecue potato chips are very flavorful. Thank goodness they have very small amount of heat. The chips are crispy and taste fresh for days. I have picked them up at least three times. I am trying the other 12 flavors soon.
--------------------
I think what I like best about these is that they keep them light and if anything, a little under coated which makes them all the more delicious. They are seasoned to perfection....not too hot or sweet, and just the right amount of smoke. Great with sandwiches!
--------------------
My favorite! Delicious!
--------------------
I continue to be a big fan of these chips, as do others that I share them with.
--------------------
I love chips, and bbq flavor is beyond tasty, and fulfilling you can't eat just one.
--------------------
Nice & crunchy! A chip lovers delight!
--------------------
Best chip ever! Best chip ever! Best chip ever!
--------------------
Great taste and texture!!
--------------------
FINALLY CAME 'NOT" CRUSHED....;}
--------------------
So good!  Our favorite chips.
--------------------
I love chips. these are consistent.
--------------------
Beware: Very addictive because extremely delicious!! Major crunch, lots of flavor and not oversalted so if you want more you can add it. More addictive than Pringles!!
--------------------
These are the only potato chips I buy. If the store doesn't have them or they're out of stock, I do without.
Great flavor, kettle made.
--------------------
Chips are the snack that everyone loves. Chips are a light snack that can be eaten at any time. While chips have always been a top-notch snack, there is one uncertainty about chips: What is the best brand of chips? After my years of extensive research, I can confirm that the Lays Original Kettle Chips are the perfect chip brand. These kettle chips are the Dark Souls of chips, and they make you really feel like your eating an after school snack again.
     Lays chips have always had the perfect dimension of a chip. These chips have near perfect curvature, and their size is just the right range. According to the Chip Licking International Team, these chips have a length of 1 inch to 3 inches, which is the perfect length. This size fits perfectly inside one's mouth, and is big enough to feel like a full bite. Any chip fanatic can confirm that these sizes are the best size for a snack.
     Lays Original Kettle Chips also have a perfect taste. By using the highly acclaimed kettle technology, Lays has perfected the chip. By using exactly 90 milligrams of salt to help create a perfect ratio for the chip, lays has created a taste that can recreate the nostalgic feeling of an after school snack. The taste is perfect not only for the men, but the women and children too. 
     Lays production quality is unmatched to any other brand in the chip industry. According to the Great Association of Meal Evaluating Reviewers (GAMER), these chips have a .2% mistake factor. This shows how consistent Lays are when producing this quality snack. 
     Overall, these chips are a mastapeece. These chips are perfect for anyone wanting the greatest snack that they can obtain.
--------------------
Delicious chips! Great texture, crunchy, just the right amount of salt and very addictive.
--------------------
great gluten free snack
--------------------
wish they were organic.
--------------------
Perfect size for Thanksgiving! Everyone loves Lays!! Easy to eat with multiple types of dips!
--------------------
Love the consistency from this brand!
--------------------
Thanks for carrying this item! My granddaughters favorite item and love it's in a snack bag so it's just enough to have.
--------------------
My favorite chips for salsa dipping
--------------------
Tasted like good old lays
--------------------
Perfect for road trips or hikes, when the kids jut need something to crunch on. The portions are good too, because I never want to give them big amounts of snacks.
--------------------
My favorite plain chip to go with any dip
--------------------
delicious and classic
--------------------
I love Lay's Classic Potatoes Chips. I bought them when there was a really good deal on the amount I was getting (if I chose the Pickup option). I'm very satisfied I got these chips.
--------------------
Seems Lays is getting cheap as less than half of the bag was filled! Paid a heck of a lot for a bag of air. Very disappointing.
--------------------
The chips were opened, am so disappointed.
--------------------
Great potato chips! Our go to for snacking!
--------------------
My favorite 'nuff said.  Best traditional potato chip on the market.
--------------------
Always fresh and usual on sale. Love these chips. Light and crispy
--------------------
You can’t eat just one. Delicious as always.
--------------------
Great product at a low price.  Perfect for sharing, everyone gets their own little bag.
--------------------
These are my all time favorite potato chips! Always great tasting! Great crunch! Great value! Always fresh! I didn't have many potato chips stocked up in my pantry. Why would I? Whenever I ran low of my favorite chips I could always just run up to the grocery store to get more. Then the pandemic hit. I searched online but most stores had run out of Lays classic potato chips. I tried Target online and there they were! I ordered several bags immediately. They arrived at my house just a few days later and with free shipping! These are great chips at a great price! Thank you Target for having our backs during these trying times. While most other stores have run out of the most popular products, Target has plenty and are ready to have them at your doorstep within days AND with free shipping! That can't be beat. Thank you Target! You rock! Great product! Great taste! Perfect crunch!
--------------------
Very poor packaging. All of my item where shipped together with cans. Of course that means the bags were busted and crumbled chips..
--------------------
Lay's has been a household staple ever since I was a kid! I love this 12 count bag so that there is some self-control in my home! The chips are not all crumbled and just enough. It's something about opening a bag of deliciousness and finishing it and that is why I choose the singles versus the big bag. The only complaint I have is that I wish that the Lovely Lay's would not use vegetable oil and switch to expeller-pressed so that us Lay's lovers could indulge more frequently without the sunflower/corn or canola oil.
--------------------
So yum! My fam loves
--------------------
I like this size because they’re so good I’m tempted to eat a whole bag of  the larger sizes!
--------------------
I acquired these in the store. The package had one of the little face things on them so I could take a funny picture for my Facebook account. But I received no face and I am mad. Still tasted good though
--------------------
these are the best chips and they have simple ingredients.
--------------------
chips were smashed into crumbs.
--------------------
Even though we have only 2 in our family, this is the only size we will buy.....and even then they don't last very long! Tired of cheaper brands which are usually stale, greasy and either over or under salted. Lay's always comes through with the perfect chip, and as a topping make my casseroles super crunchy and delicious with my homemade dips! They arrived in perfect condition with plenty of bubble wrap, which I recycle. Thanks Target!!
--------------------
The bag was open with half of the chips in the box.
--------------------
Half of the bag I ordered came opened because they push too hard on the bags when they are packing them.
--------------------
arrived crushed in box, nothing but crumbs.
--------------------
It arrived in a very good item in a well-packaged box, no crushed chips. Target is very professional in shipping.
--------------------
The lays classic chips is the best chips one can ever have...
--------------------
I received these today, Nov 24, I ordered them online. I had ordered several boxes so we could put them on the porch for our delivery drivers as a treat. There are only like 6 weeks left until they expire! With chips and snacks like these, you should at least have a few months. Very disappointing.
--------------------
Great pack of chips!
--------------------
nice variety and good price
--------------------
Some of the bags of chips expire soon
--------------------
great mixture of snacks in one box
--------------------
I have a husband in construction and a growing boy. Someone is always snacking. This is a must have in our house
--------------------
Shipped this as part of a care package to a family member. I love how easy it is to have target do the heavy lifting for me!
--------------------
Good variety of chips.  My kids enjoy them
--------------------
it has the variety my family likes
--------------------
Old and stale. May just be a bad batch for me, but not enjoyable. Had to toss.
--------------------
Exactly what you want for snack time! Great selection and price wasn't hateful. My 4 yr old loves to pick out his snack! Would definitely buy again!
--------------------
Very tasty chips with mild seasoning
--------------------
Honestly really good, only purchased because they were on sale but I loved them! Would purchase again
--------------------
I loved this brand but this bag was stale, the expiration date wasnfor 2021 but they just tasted awful
--------------------
I purchase this brand of chips often. They are GREAT!
--------------------
Crunchy, salty, and a little sweet. My favorite chip!
--------------------
I like...tasted better than other chips
--------------------
LOVE these chips!!! So delicious. Savory with a slight sweetness.
--------------------
This chip is extremely salty compared to the other flavor from this brand.
--------------------
Ordered these twice and both times they were well past the expiration date.
--------------------
I really like the variety of textures and there is a good sea salt flavor.
--------------------
Very good, perfect size for road trips or any quick occasion.
--------------------
My son really love this. It's tiny and easy for him to carry around. Nice quick grab and go snack for any trip.
--------------------
Good vending item could have been packed better
--------------------
LOVE PRINGLES VERY TASTY AND FRESH..
--------------------
Flavor is perfect! Great texture and stacked to prevent breakage!
--------------------
Tasty, more like actual potato chips than Pringles. Cheaper, too.
--------------------
SOOOOOOO GOOOOD!!!!!! They taste better than Pringles! Crunchy and tasty! And thicc but still REAALLLYY good!! Tastes more like potato than Pringles, and actually have a lot for the container! Would totally recommend.
--------------------
Made the switch from Pringles, never looked back. These chips are generously salted on the correct side, too.
--------------------
I like these much better than pringles. They're a little thicker which gives a better crunch and taste more like regular bagged potato chips. These taste similar to regular lays but not as greasy.
--------------------
Do we have negative stars :-) ,Lays has made very - very bad copy of pringles.
--------------------
i love the lays chips in any packaging.
--------------------
these are delicious. i love them. wish they made lightly salted or unsalted.
--------------------
they are my most favorite chip taste and price are great
--------------------
I bought these for a quick, on the go snack!! They are great tasting chips!!
--------------------
These are our faves!
--------------------
I loved the flavor and packaging. Also items stayed fresh even after a few days
--------------------
These chips are absolutely amazing, My kids and I love these
--------------------
Great flavor. Not too strong. Cheap.
--------------------
I really like Pringles. They are good. I would recommend them.
--------------------
I buy them all the time me and my granddaughter can eat them just eat them just like that but nothing else
--------------------
I buy some at least 2x a month . My family and I love them
--------------------
I bought 2 cans because I like them with meals. The taste good. Go good with Hot Dogs.
--------------------
I loved the taste of the sour cream potato chips. I loved the crunch of the bite. I would buy again for sure.
--------------------
The Sour Cream and Onion Pringles were good and satisfying. They are not my favorite of all the flavors but they are still tasty and what you would expect a Pringle chip to taste like.
--------------------
My son has me get these Pringles Sour Cream and Onion just about every week. He loves the taste and texture!
--------------------
they taste a not at all sour but like super artificial and have slight union powder taste although its not the most pleasant flavor to ever exist they are super salty like my ex boyfriend overall this is overpriced for how long the stack lasts because i eat a lot of food and these are very addicting.
--------------------
A nice side to eat with a sandwich and a dill pickle.
--------------------
I bought Pringles this month, they are the best. Sour cream and onion are my favorite.
--------------------
These are an all time favorite. Must buy on every trip to store. Crisp, just right amount of flavor and salt. Only wish can was larger.
--------------------
I dont normally write reviews but I am today. I typically buy 6-8 cans of pringles a week because my entire family loved them. But either their is a change in the recipe or a quality control issue. Every can I bought tastes like original recipe pringles. It tastes nothing like sour cream and onion. I don't know why the recipe has changed but, I will be buying the Lays Stackable Sour Cream and Onion chips and will tell everyone else to do so.
--------------------
Crispy and tasty! They are my fav! I usually buy them every time.
--------------------
We buy them every time we go to the store. And me and my son just loves that flavor alot.
--------------------
I let each kids pick a flavor to share. They enjoyed this flavor the most. Me? I like original.
--------------------
Really good and smooth taste, not overpowering....
--------------------
My kids LOVE Pringles !!!!! I love the Sour Cream and Onion flavor the best ! There is a flavor for everyone !
--------------------
My three years old enjoys the sour cream and onion,she will eat them throughout the day
--------------------
My husband loves snacking on pringles. Great flavor.
--------------------
Just had a craving and needed these! Taste like they always have
--------------------
I was surprised at the amount of flavor that these chips had.They were great and loaded with sour cream and onion.
--------------------
My grandkids love them. They like to make duck bills in their mouth before eating them.
--------------------
My daughter actually ate these and she loved it. She recommends these!
--------------------
Not too overpowering but a solid flavor you’ll enjoy.
--------------------
Fresh & good quality.
--------------------
I bring at work everyday afternoon time and good eat with pop
--------------------
I buy a sour cream and onion and cheddar cheese can every week !!! I lo e pringles and am one of the biggest fans thank yall for everything you guys and girls do!!!
--------------------
These are our absolute favorite flavor. They never disappoint.
--------------------
Sour Cream & Onion Pringles are my favorite flavor. I will continue to purchase them.
--------------------
My daughter loves these! Favorite snack!
--------------------
Just discovered the MEGA STACK. It's the happiest I've been all pandemic. Great mouth feel.
--------------------
I enjoy putting Pringles on my sandwich. It adds a new flavor. Sour Cream & Onion is my favorite but I also like barbeque, salt & vinegar and original
--------------------
These are my daughter's and husband's favorite snack.
--------------------
I bought the pringles because they are a good flavor to eat.
--------------------
Never disappointed in Pringle’s They are always on the lisr
--------------------
I love Pringles, many flavors of them; however, my most recent purchase of SC&O flavor has no flavoring.... just plain chips in my green can. What happened Mr. Pringle?
--------------------
Pringle’s you cant go wrong as they taste great and I got them on sale which was a great deal!
--------------------
Pringle’s has definitely changed the sour cream flavor. It’s no longer nearly as good as it used to be and we’ve both it a couple times hoping maybe it was just a bad batch to no avail. These are no longer good.
--------------------
I love these pringles, but recently have bought a can that smell and taste very off and weird, defo not the normal taste?
--------------------
Yummy! My sons favorite!
--------------------
I purchased a can of sour cream and onion chips and they tasted like regular potato chips. There’s was zero flavor whatsoever. I thought I just got a bad can, but I purchase another can the other day and it was the same issue! Not sure if you have changed the seasoning or what but these chips don’t taste the same :(
--------------------
I love these, but I stopped buying and eating them because I became a vegan. I would really like to be able to experience and enjoy these again.
--------------------
I decided to try this flavour and I’m so glad I did!!
--------------------
I got this for my birthday and the are amaze balls!!!!
--------------------
i regularly buy this product. Im happy with its unique taste
--------------------
Would buy this product again has great taste all the qualifications.
--------------------
The Sour Cream and Onion Pringles are so super good. When you take that first bite, you are hit with a super delicious sour cream and onion flavor that stays on your tongue for a little while. The flavor is nor too strong or to mild. It is perfect, just right. Definitely recommend!
--------------------
I love Pringles Sour cream and onion crisps...there just that good.
--------------------
I have always loved these chips they are fantastic definitely recommend
--------------------
Uh there’s not really besides the fact that they taste exquisite.
--------------------
I truly enjoy the great tangy taste and sharing is with my family.
--------------------
This is my go to flavor for Pringles.....I love them. I try all the flavors but always come back to Sour cream and onion!
--------------------
Me and my kids love this flavor of Pringles! Quick snack that we can get to watch TV or play games.
--------------------
EXCELLENT flavor … LOVE the crispness of the chips
--------------------
What isn't a good flavor of Pringles!? I rank these as one of my top 3 favorites, along with Original and Barbecue.
--------------------
I eat them all the time. Please do not get rid of them
--------------------
I liked that now pringles are thin and crunchy and light and the flavor not too strong
--------------------
I buy all the time. That's my favorite flavor that every one like in my house
--------------------
I'm pretty sure you won't enjoy the crisp, salty, oniony, and still smooth sour creamy deliciousness inside every can of Pringles Sour Cream & Onion chips... I'll take this one for the Human Race and eat them all!! I'm a great human like that - your welcome....
--------------------
Love this flavor, and the Pringles chip makes it even better. A great combination of flavor and chip!
--------------------
I'm glad Pringles has sour cream and onion potato chips because it's been one of my staple flavors for chips since I was a child.
--------------------
My kids love this flavor! We have to buy several cans to make them all happy!
--------------------
my daughter (collage age) can eat 4 cans a week if ill buy them
--------------------
I bought this last week. it was delicious. MY FAMILY LOVE IT.
--------------------
Sour Cream and Onion is my favorite! I dig the flavor!
--------------------
I've been buying Pringle's Sour Cream and Onion for years and it is my favorite flavor. I actually prefer the Low Fat version over the regular as it has the same taste/flavor but with less calories and I would give the low fat version 5 stars
--------------------
I usually buy the Cheddar for me and the BBQ for my husband, but the store was out of the Cheddar and had Sour Cream and Onion so I bought them instead. I loved them they were absolutely delicious. Great taste and great value.
--------------------
My children like sour cream and onion chips. They say these are good but the flavor could be stronger.
--------------------
The right amount of sour cream, onion and salt. Perfect chip!
--------------------
I love Pringles of any flavor. Always fresh and crunchy and not all broken into pieces. The Sour Cream and Onion is my new favorite!
--------------------
i love these chips Have always been one to try new products and love the different flavor offered in this chip
--------------------
It?s one of my top comfort food and love mixing it with other product flavors
--------------------
Pringles sour cream and onions has the best flavor and is my favorite chip to eat with snacks or alone!
--------------------
I've long enjoyed Pringles Sour Cream & Onion, especially the short-lived low sodium version, and I'm still trying to find the Pringles Reduced Fat Sour Cream & Onion. This is my snack of choice. Thank you.
--------------------
While origianl Pringles are my favorite, Sour Cream and Onion are a close second. Sometimes I just want that extra kick and these are my go too snack. Always fresh and tasty.
--------------------
I love the taste and it goes great with french onion dip
--------------------
Love Pringles sour cream and chives they always taste great.
--------------------
Always loved pringles. Sour cream and onion are the best
--------------------
I bought this about a week ago and it was perfect exactly what I needed.
--------------------
No hassle, no fuss. The taste you crave from a brand you trust.
--------------------
I LOVE THE SOUR CREAM AND ONION PRINGLES. CLASSIC TASTE, NO ONE COMPARES.
--------------------
These Pringles Sour Cream and Onion flavor is my top favorite kind. It just has the right amount of seasoning. I love to also dip them in chip dip like sour cream and onion or ranch.
--------------------
i do not know what to put here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
--------------------
I love these chips. I could eat a whole thing by myself.
--------------------
I have always loved Pringle?s. Thin chip with loads of flavor. It seems that the recipe has changed. The chips are thicker and harder and not as much flavor. I would rather pay more to have the original recipe back than to buy the ones that are being produced today. Everything was better back in the day!!
--------------------
Bought just to try something new, and pick it now and always.
--------------------
They are right, Once you pop you really can?t stop!!
--------------------
It was what I wanted and tasted so freaking great!
--------------------
Enjoyable flavor, and nice churned, curved shape indeed.
--------------------
I love Pringle?s but this one is my favorite flavor!
--------------------
I always by this flavor. I have even gotten my grandchildren loving them.We can eat a can in one day.
--------------------
OMG!!!!!!!!!!! These chips are so full on with flavor, your mouth is gonna high-five your tongue!!!!!! They are so light, airy, and yet crunchy!!! The flavor is perfect and not so overpowering. It's an all or nothing snack for me. Once I open the can, it's guaranteed to be gone within a half hour or less!!!!
--------------------
Always good and nice and crisp and a lovely snack to eat.
--------------------
I bought these for my son and he loves them.The chips stay whole and are crunchy!
--------------------
We love BBQ Pringles at our house, they are a family favorite.
--------------------
It got this today and tried it.It was so good five stars
--------------------
Could have more flavor seasonings on the chips.
--------------------
Most of the chips were broken into small pieces.
--------------------
Great flavorful snack to share with others, never lasts long so get a couple of canisters to share lol
--------------------
my go to chip when i need to add flavor to my meals
--------------------
These have a smoky bbq flavor and the fun of eating a fun shaped Pringle chip!
--------------------
I love pringles BBQ more than anything in this world every can I get is full of epic flavor and delicious crunchy goodness
--------------------
My husband and I love this tangy BBQ flavor. I always pick some up when I go out by the store!
--------------------
sweet and tangy flavor reminds me of BBQ ribs and potato salad
--------------------
I hadn't bought these for awhile and forgot what i was missing!
--------------------
The size and shape of a Pringle Chip enhances the BQ favor!
--------------------
I love the BBQ flavor! The crunch of Pringle’s can’t be beat. Can’t eat just one!
--------------------
If you see this add my insta @sam_is_green that would be funny
--------------------
Does not hardly taste like BBQ. Not enough flavor added.
--------------------
My kids love Pringles so I bought regular and wanted to try the BBQ and they are good tasting chips!
--------------------
I've been eating these a long time and last couple months they have had no taste at all. I just throw the entire can in the garbage. I keep purchasing them hoping for a better taste but not. I only like the barbecue ones.
--------------------
They love the sour cream, I enjoy it too. Great for game night.
--------------------
Grandchildren enjoy them so I buy them. They are easy to pack when we road trip.
--------------------
I bought the BBQ flavor Pringles for the first time last week. I like most of Pringles flavor chips and this was no exception. It was perfectly seasoned with the BBQ flavor and not too overbearing. It is my new favorite flavor.
--------------------
I always buy Pringles Barbecue because they are light, not heavy like other barbecue chips. They also don't leave a barbecue taste in your mouth like the other brands.
--------------------
I buy these all the time. only problem is I'm not the only one that eats them
--------------------
I like to grab a handful when I need a little snack. But, I always go back for another handful : )
--------------------
They’re the best. I like all Pringle’s flavors, but bbq has always stood out. Not sure what it is.
--------------------
bought for a picnic love them. its my kids favorite chip.
--------------------
I love all pringles. When I buy chips Pringles is all I buy. My Grandson also loves pringles. His favorite is ranch.
--------------------
More than half the chips in three separate containers broken. One container actually broken open and spilled out into the box.
--------------------
Not very barbecuey at all! Not bad, but try something else if you want BBQ flavor.
--------------------
BBQ beats plain and all the other varieties, except... Honey Mustard soundly thrashes BBQ, if you can find it. Unfortunately, we’re not fans of the only local store to carry them and Honey Mustard is by far our favorite. So we don’t buy Pringles as often as we otherwise would.

Always crisp get taste. Our family love them along with Cheddar chips also.
--------------------
Really like them. Not so heavy on the seasoning so doesn’t get all over the place.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite chips. My grandkids like to eat them too.
--------------------
Buy them all the time. Can’t get enough of them. Love the fullness of the can.
--------------------
Tasty and so delightful a good snack between catching criminals after the chase; light and tasty.
--------------------
This is my favorite Pringles flavor, they're sooooo good. It's an explosion of BBQ in your mouth. If you like BBQ, I recommend these chips for you.
--------------------
Why add dairy to a BBQ flavor? There was no whey in this product for years. Now I can no longer eat this product.
--------------------
Still my favorite go-to chip.
--------------------
It is yummy. *****When asked if anything else he said no.
--------------------
bough this the other day and it fixed my cravings.
--------------------
Very nice and crispy taste completely excellent.....
--------------------
This is probably my top favorite flavor of pringles along with the vinegar and salt flavor. I reccommend trying these if you haven't because hey, why not?! its only $1.69
--------------------
These are my absolute favorite flavor of Pringles by far! They are so delicious, they have a wonderful BBQ flavor, you can really taste the smoky seasoning on them, to. Definitely recommend these!
--------------------
I’ve been a fan of Pringle’s since I was about 10 or 11, and I’m now in my mid 40s. The original ones were my favorite until Pringle’s introduced the Sweet & Spicy BBQ flavor. My children loves them as well. With so many varieties, there’s one for everyone. I would like for the limited edition Cinnamon Pringle’s to make a comeback for Christmas.
--------------------
I love Pringle’s and I love to stack different flavors
--------------------
the tast was bold and made you keep on snaken it was a splash on tast
--------------------
I have always loved Pringle’s, once I eat one I cannot stop!! I discovered this chip awhile ago and it’s by far my favorite Pringle flavor and not only just my favorite Pringle flavor but my favorite bbq style of chip. It truly captivates the taste of real bbq sauce with its sweet and tangy seasoning.
--------------------
Pringles are yummy they is very good I like de bbq ones
--------------------
If there's one must have, go-to snack that's in our house @ all times, it's always BBQ flavored Pringles. We only buy & eat chips (Pringles) that don't look & feel super greasy that comes in a bag filled with more air than chips.
--------------------
BBQ Pringles is the only flavor of Pringles that I buy. They are a delicious snack that pairs well with my lunch.
--------------------
with so much time at home nice to have an easy snack
--------------------
Still brown bag my lunch @ work. Usually a sandwich that is always better with Pringles BBQ Chips.

When I buy Pringles BBQ is my first choice! Love the flavor!

The chips have a good flavor and the Pringle's ?crunch? I?ve come to expect
--------------------
I have been buying these for quite some time and they are one of my favorite flavors.
--------------------
Purchased them on accident. They were good, just flavored weird.
--------------------
My 18 and 21 year old boys love these. Nice addition.

Great Flavor! Other Chips Flavoring is OVER Powering!
--------------------
I brought this flavor to my son every time that i go grocery shopping near my home because is his favorite. And now it's my favorite too.
--------------------
I love the flavor of BBQ & Pringle?s BBQ has a real mesquite flavor that?s out of this world.
--------------------
Love them , taste great not to salty.................
--------------------
I go camping, a lot, and I always buy at least 3 canisters of Pringles, especially the BBQ flavor. I have a can going, one at the campsite, and one to go home with. Now, I don't just get the BBQ flavor, I get regular and...maybe 2 of the BBQ flavor. (gotta stop though, can't live on chips alone)
--------------------
I love Pringles and I am a BIG BBQ fan so together it is my Favorite.
--------------------
The kids get so excited when I bring these home from the store
--------------------
I eat BbQ pringles with slices of Colby cheese or bowl of Cottage Cheese for a quick high protein middle of day or evening snack. Great with Sandwiches of All kinds.
--------------------
I bought Pringles BBQ flavor and love them for snacking.
--------------------
Delicious. I enjoyed these better than the regular BBQ potato chips. And really great with some Ranch dressing.
--------------------
Pringles = yum Pringles BBQ = YUMMMMMM! Sorry I decided to share. Should have kept them all to myself.
--------------------
My family and I really enjoy the taste,so good I actually have to hide some for myself
--------------------
I always buy Pringles when I buy chips....especially like the barbeque and sour cream as well as the original!
--------------------
Fresh and crisp as well as tasty!! Kids are them all up!!
--------------------
I was looking for a snack that was crispy, crunchy and flavorful. The BBQ Pringles were just right. They have a great flavor, but aren't too spicy. My grandson loves them too.
--------------------
I like the taste of the BBQ pringles. These are what I normally choose to eat.
--------------------
I tried this flavor an now the only one I buy. I have changed people's mind too.
--------------------
These BBQ chips are great. Not too spicy or salty. Pringles has another hit.
--------------------
We can't keep a FULL can in our house!! Our young daughters LOVE these, so flavorful
--------------------
Bought this for my 8 year old daughter and she absolutely loved them. Buying more this weekend.
--------------------
This is my favorite kind of Pringles! I love the barbq taste and the freshness of the chip. There is just something about the smoky taste of the barbq. Love!
--------------------
It is the perfect mix of BBQ flavors! The texture is really great too!
--------------------
Buy occasionally and enjoy them. Good flavor, great price.
--------------------
This is the flavor that everyone in our house love.
--------------------
I brought these spicy/sweet Bbq rippled chips and now my family is addicted.
--------------------
These chips will be a staple in my pantry. I relike the flavor ally
--------------------
Love the stack can , perfect for travel , no smashed or broken chips
--------------------
I’m so happy that me and peepa get to eat these yummy Pringle’s together
--------------------
These Pringle’s are very good, however, I would recommend added more barbecue seasoning. I’ve had some cans where the flavor is just out of this world, but I’ve had others that taste so boring and have no flavor. Overall I like them, just cross your fingers you got a good can.
--------------------
well, i had this when i was small, and it was amazing! i still have it now and its delicious! the only problem would be that its quite expensive, so... >_< but i love it!
--------------------
Everyone in my family love it
