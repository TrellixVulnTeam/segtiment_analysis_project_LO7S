I use this soup all the time in a variety of recipes, typically I buy the generic brand but not anymore. This soup is very thick, and flavorful compared to the generic brands, and considerably less salty. It’s thick, and thins out as you cook, or add milk or water to make a “cream based” sauce or soup. I even use it in pot pies, and casseroles. I highly recommend this soup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Campbell's has another delicious soup in their Cream of Chicken. It's a great low-fat, low calorie soup that you can heat and serve straight from the can, mix with milk to make it even creamier or use recipes to make a delicious sauce or gravy. My favorite mixed with milk and served with saltines. It's super easy and delicious and warms you from the inside out on a cold winter day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Campbell's is the only brand I buy, trust, for the highest quality of ingredients and wonderful taste. Their condensed is the only way to go for awesome taste and versatile uses, Love this by itself & add it to many dishes to add that perfect blend for my meals. Their cream of chicken is a very needed household item & works amazingly in cold/flu season as a power punch to get rid of them while enjoying this wonderful soup. I have tried other brands & end up throwing them out because of their taste. Love this soup

Campbell quality is outstanding

On somethings, I can buy generic and can’t tell a differences.  Campbell’s is the only tomato soup my family will eat.

I have never found a substitute for this great soup. So flavorful, tangy, rich and creamy. I find it very restorative for me, and also really helps me sleep better if I have it with evening meal or before turning in. Also use it in my spice cake for a fabulous twist!! (Recipe can be found on Campbell's website). I do add a good dash of cayenne for more snappiness and health benefits. Great way to stave off winter chills!
--------------------
Very tasty and worked well in the green bean casserole recipe.

Absolutely amazing on smothered pork chops

comes out in one big chunk and has a chemical off taste to it. wouldn't recommend.

I love French onion soup but rarely have the time to make it from scratch. Campbell's French onion soup is a delicious, quick alternative to making it from scratch.

I used the Campbell’s French Onion soup while I was sick over the holidays. The broth had a deep beef flavor, and the bit and pieces of the onion gave the soup a nice consistency. I added some croutons and cheese to the top and enjoyed a good warm meal. It has the cooked all day flavor you get from home-cooked French onion soup, but in the convenience of a can.

I incorporated the Campbell’s Condensed French Onion Soup into one of my family’s favorite recipes, French Onion burgers. We have enjoyed this recipe for many years, with a powder French onion mix. But, when we tried Campbell’s Condensed French onion soup our minds were blown (and taste buds screamed for joy)! What a huge difference this soup made when mixing it with some ground beef and adding a slice of cheese on top! Just by using Campbell’s soup, it created so much juicy flavor to each bite!! And, the flavor was so much better than what we had been “enjoying” all of these years! Since changing out the powder French onion mix to the soup, everything has been so much more enjoyable than before! Now, I use Campbell’s for my meatloaf, my French onion soup, dips and so much more! This can has a tasty blend of beef stock and onions. Campbell’s Condensed French Onion Soup is now my go-to staple for all of my favorite recipes! Great flavor in every bite and definitely adds a burst of flavor into any dish or great by itself! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really like the Campbell's French Onion Soup. The soup is very easy to prepare by adding one soup can full of water. You can prepare the soup on the stove top, or in the microwave. The soup can be heated and eaten as is, or can be used in recipes. On the back of the French Onion Soup can label there is a recipe for Dripping Roast Beef Sandwiches with Provolone Cheese, so I used the can of soup to make that recipe. The end results were tasty! The French Onion Soup really added flavor to the roast beef, and made the sandwiches taste great. It was a winner with the entire family. The soup had an over all great beef taste, with the perfect amount of onions. I can see this soup becoming a staple in my pantry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am glad lots of other folks gave this high praise; however, I not only did not like the flavor; and also found it much too runny. I usually use Cream of Mushroom or Chicken soup as a base for my casseroles as opposed to making a roux.   My cheese and mac which I make from scratch 2 x a week, came out with not near as much flavor, and quite dry.  To me it has a strange taste, even a bit bitter.  Donated all to my local food bank!!

This campbells cream of chicken healthy request was really good in the casserole I made, really easy to use and liked that you don't have to use a can opener. The reason i gave it 4 stars is because it does not give enough flavor to the food, and I think that is because it is suppossed to be healthy, which is a good thing. I like that campbells makes healthy stuff for recipes and something that is good for everybody. I also think it wasn't as thick as the original, it is a little bit thinner consistency but overall it still leaves my recipes really good. Will definitely recommend especially to anybody that is trying to live a healthier lifestyle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I don't 100% love this. the taste is a little cheap-y. with the right ingredients and spices this can make an acceptable dinner addition or lunch soup . so 4 out of 5 seems fair.
--------------------
It’s a very tasty soup I loved it it was very refreshing even my kid who is a very picky eater loved it. Campbell’s soups are tasty but this one in particular was very creamy. I would definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I LOVE this soup. When I am sick I only eat this soup. My wife always wants to bring in the chicken noodle but I am a potato soup man through and through. Campbell’s only!! I also love it when it’s freezing outside and the fire place is going. I feel like a frontier man! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This potato soup tastes pretty good. I liked that there were chunks of potatoes in it, and it tastes like it's made with real milk. The texture is nice and creamy. It's a good, hearty soup. It's convenient and easy to make right from the can. On its own with no added seasoning, I'd consider it to be a little bland, but it makes a great base to add to. It's a great staple to have in the kitchen. I'd recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Campbell's has been apart of my family for generations. We've used it for general eating as well as making creamy broths or gravies. My entire family loves adding it in to other meals to make for an appealing dinner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

One of my favorite things about cream of soups, is that they are good for solo enjoyment or for adding to your favorite recipe. I decided that I wanted to keep things simple, and used this as my main dish. I added some garlic powder, (because I like mine garlicy) some freshly chopped bacon, a little bit of cheddar cheese, and some chives. Delicious! Creamy but not gritty. Tasty and robust! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really enjoyed this potato soup. The only thing I didn’t like was the super thick texture and lack of more seasoning to potatoes. The color is bland and not to appealing but it doesn’t doesn’t half bad. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Since childhood this has always been my favorite Campbell soup product. Thick and creamy soup with just enough potatoes so that you can get them in every bite. The taste has not changes one bit. It has a great flavor to it one that you can enjoy any time of the day. My daughter and boys loved it and now wants it all the time. It was a win in my household.

I recently purchased a can of Campbell's Condensed Cream of Potato Soup. Campbell's have been around for years and they always have good tasting products. This soup is very tasty and is condensed, so milk or water can be added to extend the serving. It is also very healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love using Campbell’s condensed soups to cook with or on their own. I came across this Campbell’s Condensed Cream of Potato Soup and had to give it a try. I had never used this particular one but now it’s a staple in my kitchen! It’s great as a soup when you simply follow directions on the can but I also love to use it when I’m cooking too. I’ve always been a good ole country cook and am able to cook just about everything and not have a recipe. I decided to skip a few steps in my potato soup the other day and add this can to it to make up for it. It tasted so good! The pot was gone that night and I usually have left overs! So this condensed soup is a winner for me! It doesn’t disappoint and speaks for itself with the wonderful flavors. I’ll continue to recommend Campbell’s and their cream of potato soup! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Easy to make, directions are very clear. I was able to have a hot lunch in a matter of minutes. It's a quality soup that was rich and creamy and full of flavor. I'll be buying Campbell's from now on and recommending it to my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I tried the Campbell's cream of potato soup and it so good. It was very easy to make and easy to clean up. It was very tasty , not bland or overly seasoned. It had nice chunks of potatoes and a decent amount of them. It is one of my favorites. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I used this soup as a base for another soup I love to prepare, New England Clam Chowder. It was fantastic! I sauteed 1 small onion, 2 cloves of garlic,and 1 teaspoon of thyme in 2 tablespoons of butter and let it simmer for a few minutes. Then I add 2 (6.5-ounce) cans of chopped clams including the juices,and an entire can of Cream of Potato soup and let it cook until it just started to boil. Finally, just before serving, I added 4 strips of cooked chopped bacon and topped each bowl with a sprinkle of minced parsley. My family loved it! This soup has a wonderful flavor that makes every dish you use it in a masterpiece. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I would rate Campbell's cream of potato soup as an average tasting soup, nothing special. I think it lacked some flavor. While I could taste the potato, there was not much other flavor to it. I like more flavor to my soup than this. However, it would be good if you needed a bland diet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My mom is in the cold weather and shipping her 15 of these is so helpful. She says they are her little bowls of heaven. Great nutrition for her and easy for her to make.
--------------------
This is my favorite cream soup from Campbell's! I always like to make sure I have a stock pile so I never run out. After I heat it up I throw in some shredded cheese and let it melt...makes it extra thick and adds a little flavor. Then I top it off with some black peppercorn. Mmmmm...I'm getting hungry.

This delicious Cream of Celery soup was thicker and creamier than I expected. I guess the celery aspect made me think it would be more "brothy", but I was pleasantly surprised and found it to be a delicious addition to a chicken and rice dish. I love that it has zero trans fats too. The celery flavor is not over-powering, but definitely can be tasted. I like the taste of celery salt on my hot dogs, so I'm sure this Cream of Celery soup would work great with a lot of different food creations. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have used Campbell’s soups in the past in casserole recipes but never tried the Healthy Requests.

I love how creamy and tasty this soup is. The celery is definitely there but not over powering. I like to add a can to my homemade stuffing (dressing if you are from the south).

A new year calls for a more healthy way of eating. This is not the kind of soup I would usually eat, but I decided to try it out. I had a bowl for lunch and it was very tasty. I could taste celery courtesy of the moderately sized chunks and I felt quite full after eating it. I mixed the soup with one can of water as opposed to milk and it was perfectly adequate. It still tasted rich and flavorful. The soup wasn't over the top in terms of calories and contains zero trans fat thus making it heart healthy. These are the main reasons I wanted to try it. I liked it very much and will definitely be purchasing it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I used the cream of celery soup to make a "sauce" for baked chicken. Served it over white rice with some steamed veggies on the side. It was quick and easy to make and most of my children loved it. My youngest two (5 and 6) don't really eat much they are extremely picky but I bribed them to taste it. No complaints but they still opted to eat peanut butter sandwiches instead.

I'm not sure why I had never tried Campbell's tomato bisque soup before now because one of my favorite meals is grilled cheese and Campbell's tomato soup.I have been eating this since I was a child. I am so glad I gave this a try because it is now my favorite. It's so easy to make and I love the diced tomatoes, adding some extra texture and flavor. I like to add half water and half milk to make it a little creamy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I'm a big fan of tomato soup so I thought I'd for sure love this! However, it was much to sweet. The more of it I ate the less i enjoyed the taste. I couldnt finish my bowl.

The Campbell Tomato Bisque Soup is delicious any time of year, but especially right now it is one of my favorite Campbell soups to sit back, enjoy and warm up with during the cold winter months. Every spoonful is hearty with soft tomato pieces and creamy, flavorful tomato soup that is indulging and brings back many childhood memories. This soup comes in an easy to open can with pull tab, and easy to follow instructions. Just mix with a cup of water and heat up either on the stovetop or in the microwave and you will have a tasty, heartwarming soup in no time! I highly recommend Campbell soups. They always taste fresh, made with only excellent quality ingredients, and they make a great staple in every home! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My latest product to review is Campbell's Condensed Tomato Bisque, 10.75 oz. Can. This is really good soup! Campbell's has always made good soup and tomato soup has always been my favorite.

This great tasting soup can be used in casseroles for additional flavor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

When i got this soup i was very happy to try it out. It has a very smooth and creamy constancy. I have looked for this soup in my local store but o had no luck finding it. My only con about this soup would be the amount of tomatos in the soup. It could definaly use a few more in my opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

A classic and very delicious soup. It was easy to prepare as well. Just added a can of water into a pot on the stove and it was done in minutes. I could see the tomato pieces as I stirred.

Who doesn't love a warm bowl of tomato bisque on a cold rainy day? Unbelievable taste. The flavors pop and compliment each other amazingly.

I like Campbell soups in general, and this new flavor did not disappoint. It is very nice and creamy, and I felt like it didn’t need any improvement as far as taste goes. All I had to do is heat and enjoy. I like that the soup was in condensed form, so I added as much milk as I wanted, to my personal taste. I prefer my soup thicker, and it was easy to do with this condense tomato bisque. I think I can also use it to make tomato sauce for the meatballs. I will definitely buy it again and try it in my own recipe. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It tasted like a creamy tomato soup. Definitely good with grilled cheese sandwiches on a cold night! It was quick and easy to make, I enjoyed the small tomato pieces. I would of loved more spices and cheese added to it, just to give it more than if I went and got a regular can of tomato soup and made it with milk.

This is not your average tomato soup. It is creamy and smooth, with small pieces of tomato. I made it with milk instead of water and it was so good. It is very easy and quick to make. Perfect for a cold winter day. This will be our go-to soup from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I prefer to add 1/2 can water and 1/2 can half and half to mrake the soup creamier. I also like to add a Tbsp. or two of a Medium-Heat Chunky Style Salsa and crush up some White Corn Tortilla Chips and toss in some diced avocado to the prepared Tomato Bisque for a southwestern flair. So yummy, one of my fav soups to make all year round. Serve w/any flavor quesadilla ( 4-cheese blend Mexican Blend Shredded Cheese and some mild green chilis is also a fav) and you have an easy quick inexpensive meal for anytime, night or day! Enjoy!!!
--------------------
Love chicken & rice soup & Campbell’s who can beat it
--------------------
Exactly like I remember it from when I was little.  There's nothing better on a cold day after playing out in the snow, or when you have a cold.  Just add a can of water and heat!
--------------------
The only store that had cream of celery! So easy to click and pick it up- so grateful for target! Saved the shoepeg corn casserole!
--------------------
A must for my scalloped potato recipe. Adds great consistency and flavor to the dish.
--------------------
is a good addition to stews or meat meals. has an acceptable flavor.
--------------------
Great soup. Great to use in recipes
--------------------
This soup was our favorite for years, but it disappeared from the shelves and has changed in the last year or so. It used to have actual filled wonton dumplings inside and a chicken type broth, but now it has dense, uniform triangular “dumplings” like you’d find in chicken and dumplings with no filling. They are NOT wontons. The meat is in the broth and is little chunks of chicken like the chicken noodle soup. So disappointing that they took these shortcuts because it doesn’t taste the same at all. Will not buy anymore.
--------------------
Very similar to Campbell’s condensed chicken noodle but with a yummy twist!
--------------------
Probably my favorite Campbell Soup and cheapest I can find as well. Just have to use them quickly because poor packaging has them arriving like they've been in a train wreck.
--------------------
I decided to give the Campbell’s Golden Mushroom a try and it’s delicious- I have used it multiple times in multiple dishes and it adds such a great flavor. Turned the flavor of roast and dirty rice up a few flavor notches- will definitely continue buying this flavor!

I used this golden mushroom soup in with my roast and it turned out amazing. The mushroom soup was savory and kinda formed a gravy base for the roast. I'm not sure if I'd eat it plain tho even tho it tastes good I'll stick to using it for cooking [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love Campbell's soups, I just tried the Golden mushroom and it was delicious! My one and only con is that NO ONE, Not Campbell's or any other soup maker puts enough mushrooms in there! lol. But Campbell's is indeed the best. Condensed so you put as much water as you like. Me, I use a bit less than half a can. Grab some crackers or bread and sit down to a nice , hot, tasty bowl of Golden Mushroom soup. Oh, and what could be better and healthier than Campbell's? They have been at this a long time. I'm 56 and have been devouring many of their soups since I was a kid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really enjoyed this Campbell's Condensed Golden Mushroom Soup. I used it to cook some pork chops in the oven. I seared the pork chops and then covered them with this soup. They were so delicious.

I will definitely be stocking up on this soup for all of my cooking needs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This soup has great mushroom flavor! There are pieces of mushrooms in it that you can see which is great! I poured it in my crock pot with a roast I was cooking and the roast was delicious!

I will definitely be using this again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Golden mushroom soup is the bomb! Great for adding to my pork chops for a tasty sauce.

I used this to make sauces. I use it on beef and chicken mainly. It’s a nice base and you can add spices or wine more mushroom...whatever you like and have a nice sauce. Of course my husband just adds milk and other things and it’s it like soup [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Love the Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup. It is versatile and can be used so many ways. My favor is using for mushroom swiss burgers. Mix the soup, a pound of ground meat and bread crumbs. Fry them, add swiss and you have an out of this world burger. Mix in ground meat for moist and flavor meatloaf. I have used the soup for gravy over steaks. The options are endless, definitely a winner in my book. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

They tasted soo good i have bought and used this soup on many more recipes since then...my new go to soup [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love mushrooms and most mushroom soups, but this variety is disgusting. VERY salty in a very heavy, mushy broth. No added seasonings or additional water would save it. Golden Mushroom Soup (not to be confused with that other great cooking shortcut, Cream of Mushroom Soup) makes the easiest and cheapest crock pot chicken ever. Just put your chicken in the pot and turn it on low, then dump the soup on top of it. Spoon it around a little if you like, but you don't have to. Then walk away for six hours. When you get back, the chicken is tender and well-flavored and the soup has combined with the chicken's juices and reduced to a gravy that you can spoon over a side of mashed potatoes or rice. Now, I am not a fan of mushrooms. I hated them as a kid, but I've recently been trying to incorporate them into my diet in an attempt to gain a liking for them. Plus, the picture on the can made it look quite savory and appealing. So I bought it, and I tried it, with the addition of a little plain rice for texture. I was sadly disappointed to find that the soup tasted like a weak imitation of tomato soup - not horrible, but nearly tasteless. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
When I got golden mushroom I wasn’t sure what to expect. It has a tomato soup flavor with mushrooms added but you really don’t taste any mushroom. I wouldn’t get it just to eat by itself only because I’m not a big tomato soup fan, unless my grilled cheese is dunked. I would use it in recipes though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I use the golden mushroom soup to make a mushroom gravy for a roast and it was delicious. The whole family loved it and the color was beautiful. A great addition to any meal. I will definitely keep this in my pantry stock. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I got this prduct to make a new recipe that I found. I used it to make a wonderful new stew recipe and it made it taste great. I would definitely buy this again for many other recipes that I plan to make. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I used the mushrooms when making pork chops. I combined it with cream of mushroom soup. It was delicious! Not too salty. I love the flavor of the soup. It went well with the cream of mushroom soup. I will definitely use this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

hard to find sometime, lots of people use for cooking.

Great for our chuckwagon recipe!

I made the Campbell's Cheddar Cheese Soup tonight as a standalone. My original intention was to combine it with broccoli as I'm a huge broccoli-cheddar soup fan. But my local NYC/Manhattan grocery store was out of broccoli (we are sheltering in place due to the coronavirus pandemic and food shortages are common). So I added milk to the can of Campbell's Condensed Cheddar Cheese Soup and heated it up per instructions.  My high expectations based on the above reviews (which admittedly were garnered as part of a promotion) quickly dissolved. There was nothing "cheddar cheesy" about the soup's taste. It was simply awful and artificial tasting.  This review was NOT part of a promotion and I paid for the can of soup.
--------------------
I absolutely love this cheese soup because the flavor is so good. I made cheeseburger macaroni dip and this was a perfect ingredient to that recipe. I received a free sample courtesy of Bazaarvoice Try It Sampling for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love Campbell's but I REALLY love the Cheddar Cheese Soup. Since I was a kid, this was the best topper for hot dogs I've ever found. I used it this time to whip up a quick broccoli cheddar soup. It is extremely versatile! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love this campbells soup cheddar cheese. I love to use it as an addition to my macaroni and cheese. It keeps me from using too much milk to make my cheese sauce creamy rather then lumpy and grity. My husband also loves to eat this soup with a broccoli addition and crackers for cold nights before he goes to work. My kids love this cheese on burgers and fries. It is an all around family favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have always loved Campbell's soup. I don't know why I have never tried the condensed cheddar cheese variety. It looked interesting so I picked up a can. I decided to try the baked macaroni and cheese recipe on the can. It was easy to make and I had all the ingredients in hand. It was wonderful! It is now on the weekly rotation. I highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love to add this soup mix to my homemade macaroni and cheese. It adds such a wonderful smoothness and velvet texture. The flavor on its own it delicious too but I prefer it in macaroni and cheese. I can’t wait to try it in other things as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this to make a chicken dish that I found online. Campbells has always had the best flavor and still does. Never a let down. Great product. I wish I could find this in a larger sized can. Maybe in a different location? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I'm a big fan of this cheddar cheese soup, it's very versatile. You can make it the regular way on the can or you can use it for nachos, or I like to use it in rice or basically it can be added to any dish you want for a cheesy kick. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I never knew that Campbell's made cheddar cheese in a can, but now that I do, I am a huge fan. I have made cheese dip with tortilla chips and it was a hit on new years. I will say that my favorite to use this product for is goo-lash. This really adds a little boost of flavor to it and it was a nice addition to add as an ingredient. I highly recommend this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This cheese soup is the easiest to use for any meal. I use it to put in mashed potatoes to give them an even cheesier taste. I've used it to put over steaks, giving them and extra flavor and I've also added to my queso dip for the extra flavoring. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

--------------------
I absolutely love this cheddar cheese soup. It is great for cooking. I used it to mix in with a tator tot casserole instead of using the block cheese and it was so much better. I will continue to use this instead of block cheese from now on in my casseroles. Highly recommend to those who use cheese in their cooking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love this soup. I use it in casseroles for great cheesey flavor. I also like in scalloped potatoes. Instead of making a flour mixture for thickening, just use this soup with equal parts milk. Wonderful flavor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This cheddar soup tastes so good i really love the flavor. I have been raised on Campbells soups and thins one is my favorite. I made it with a tuna sandwich and they just went together. It was very warming and fulfilling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I did a search on target app as forced to for curbside for cream of mushroom. App auto-suggested pacific cream of mushroom, and this CHICKEN is the result #1, even though #2, #3, ans #4 are correctly cream of mushroom.  The image of box on a tiny phone size screen looks nearly identical except the word chicken vs mushroom to the pacific cream of mushroom.  I don't know why Pacific Cream of Mushroom would get auto-suggested if Target doesn't sell it.  Desperate, I put it in a chicken pot pie and it was so strongly flavored of rosemary and fat it greatly overpowered the one pacific cream of mushroom from another grocer I also added.  My potpie was very disappointing.  Great quality if you are actually looking for chicken fat and rosemary.
--------------------
Best cream of chicken soup. Always use this for cooking.
--------------------
Love this product! No yeast or gluten
--------------------
I finally found an organic cream of chicken soup that doesn’t taste like bullion cubes. It tastes homemade like I would make from scratch. It’s also gluten free.. After I finish pan frying chicken breasts I add this with some water or chicken stock. Stirring a few minutes it turns into the best pan gravy.
--------------------
Love that this soup is free ofdyes and chemicals and when you pour it out it is not all sticky and overly processed in appearance like other soups. It tastes great and love that it is gluten free.
--------------------
I was happy to find this Gluten Free soup at target, I miss having cream of chicken soup and this is a good replacement for those with celiac and have to be gluten free.
--------------------
Excellent product. Only suggestion I have is to please carry the item in the Stevens Point, WI, Target store rather than having to order it online.
--------------------
Great set, same as individual cans and same price!
--------------------
It's Campbell soup.  You've been eating this since you were a kid.  It doesn't change.   It's quick and easy.  It's Campbell soup.

I have been eating Campbell's chicken noodle soup my whole life. This was a staple in my home when we were little.

I'm a bit confused with Campbell lately. How do yo market this soup as good for you and created with "love" when you now use GMO and MSG in your products. Not all their soupls are created eqaully it seems. I did not even bother trying this Campbells Chicken Noodle soup. Campbells used to be a good for you brand, what's going on? I hope Campbells really changes this recipe for the better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I enjoyed the soup because it was fast to prepare, just a few minutes in the microwave. Add a bunch of crackers and some pepper and it was a simple meal that filled me up.. The taste is a little bland until you doctor it up a little but good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have grown up with this soup! I’m in my 40’s and this soup was around was i was growing up! As a child my mom fed me this when she needed me to eat something quick and easy to fix if she was tired or sick. There were theee other children besides myself makes four children. Plus mama. Parents were divorced. I remember when I became a teenager I went through my only eating this soup!!! It’s condensed so I would add some water let it come to a boil then munch out. I remember my mom allowed me to only eat the soup for like six months! I don’t know if that was good for my body but nothing bad ever happened. Now as I’m older, I’ve raised my kids and grandchildren with this soup. It’s so delicious and it’s a soup to be trusted! Know that with this can you will always get a can of awesomeness and amazing flavor to hit your tastebuds!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My son recently developed a soy allergy and after searching high and low for a cream soup replacement, or any soup for that matter, that was safe for him, we finally found this.  We like it.  The cream of chicken soup is good too.  Not the same taste as the canned kinds, but good in it's own right.
--------------------
not worth it, poor taste
--------------------
Have been using Pacific Organic soups for a few years and absolutely love them. I use in place of the non-organic traditional soups grandma used to use in casseroles, roasts, etc., and they're delicious!
--------------------
Best way to get gluten free condensed cream of mushroom soup. I have been using this in holiday recipes for years and have been very satisfied. Everyone who has eaten the dishes I've made with is has raved about how good they taste! Thanks Pacific Foods!
--------------------
I was looking for a mushroom soup with no MSG and found this one.  Was very excited...until I tried to eat this "stuff".  WAY too much flour and salt.  Like trying to eat wallpaper paste (even with milk/water added) and the mushrooms smelled like old shoe leather.  The cream of chicken is just as bad, heavy floury taste.  Will NOT buy these again.  You should just stick to the creamy tomato, that's good.
--------------------
I used this in my cheesy scalloped potatoes and it turned out great. Will continue to use this product.
--------------------
I recently developed a soy intolerance. You wouldn't believe how much food has soy added to it! Since I've been paying more attention to labels, I've gotten more concerned about the amount of ingredients in prepared foods that I can't pronounce. I love that everything in this soup recognizable and not a bunch of fillers.
--------------------
This is the best chicken noodle soup you’ll find at the grocery store. There are no artificial ingredients, artificial flavors, unnecessary additives or GMO‘s. It has the best ingredient list for a store-bought chicken noodle soup I have ever seen. It tastes good but it’s a little pricey.
--------------------
This order is not a 32oz as stated online. It arrived as a 12 oz tiny container. They charged $6 for basically one can of soup! I'll be returning!
--------------------
Pacific gluten-free, condensed cream of mushroom soup was a great and tasty substitute for the regular version. I used it for Thanksgiving in my broccoli casserole recipe. Tasted great! Plus, Target shipped it for free, and it arrived in time for my Thanksgiving preparation the day before. Thanks, Target!
--------------------
PN Mushroom soup in my opinion, is the only alternative out there in GF. Far superior to Progresso GF & others. Works great for a quick casserole mixing with milk or cream , sourcream, has a better outcome than water. I did much prefer the flavor of the original non GF version however. Wish they woukd bring back the cream of celery !
--------------------
I USED for cream stew (good with chicken) bread soufflé sauce with cheese and sausages, cream sauce for your pasta, many ways to use it.
--------------------
Hard to find these shaped soups in person. Wish there was more variety, kids love this.
--------------------
A favorite for our little guy! He loves to “eat up the pups!”
--------------------
My kids loved the paw patrol noodles! Huge hit in my house and I have some very picky eaters!
--------------------
Quick easy lunch for the kids! They eat it up quick since the characters are the noodles
