It is very good product.
--------------------
Perfect at home coffee! I first lit my milk and syrup in my cup, frothed, then poured my coffee. It looks wonderful and the texture is delicious!
--------------------
I cannot insert batteries, it clearly says AA, the slots are too small, impossible to push the batteries in, I tried and the battery got stuck half way, I had to scrape it out with a knife. Returning it before I could run it.
--------------------
I was so excited for this milk frother and it worked great the first few times I used it. I always hung it up on the stand it came with. It barely works and becomes wobbly super fast. Love the idea of this handheld milk frother, just bummed that it quit working so soon.
--------------------
I was looking for a reasonable almond milk frother and I now found it!!
--------------------
ABSOULUTELY love this it works great on all types of milk froths very quickly ...a breeze to clean
--------------------
Works great! It makes super frothy milk in seconds. Easy to use and easy to clean. So happy with this purchase. And they even sent a little note with it :)
--------------------
It’s a great little gadget that gets the job done. I use it with oat milk. Works great.
--------------------
Works great with oat milk and love the color! After multiple broken frothers I am happy to have one that is good quality!
--------------------
Love the color, price and that you have a small business as a supplier!
--------------------
This is the first frother I have tried, but I am loving it! Been using it for about a week now and its great! The stand is perfect for storing on my counter without taking up much space.
--------------------
I love this frother! It’s really cute and has a little stand so I can leave it on the counter. It’s perfectly powerful for my daily coffee and it’s sturdy. Have been using it for almost two weeks and it’s great. Highly recommend!
--------------------
My husband and I are obsessed. We use this daily to froth our creamer and mix our powdered collagen into our coffee!
--------------------
A coffee game changer! Where has this been all my life?!
--------------------
I really liked this frother when it arrived it looks nice & works well but I had to return it due to the cover for the batteries not staying on.
--------------------
Works great and I love that it has a stand. Froths milk very quickly!
--------------------
Powerful little tool! I am so impressed how well it mixed my matcha lattes in so little time!
--------------------
It goes way to fast and can easily splash everywhere
--------------------
Works as it says it does. Fun to make coffee drinks at home!!
--------------------
Works great and looks pretty on my counter!
--------------------
We’ve been using this for over a week and have had no issues. Don’t think I’ll ever drink coffee without frothing the milk ever again!
--------------------
Love it! Great for making lattes, especially pumpkin spice lattes in the fall!
--------------------
Does a good job frothing
--------------------
This is the 3rd frother I’ve owned. I first bought a big coffee maker with a frother which was really messy and took up a lot of space. I then bought a smaller hand held one, and the batteries kept dying. Ow this one is just right! The it’s a convenient size, comes with its own stand froths quickly and easily. I highly recommend this frother.
--------------------
Great frother - easy to store on countertop- great space saver
--------------------
Works wonders! Made the perfect latte this morning. Feels like excellent quality and has a nice weight to it. The stand is a great touch and looks nice on the counter. Plus you get to support a family business! 10/10 all around
--------------------
Love this! I've had one in the past but wow this one is powerful! Makes a perfect latte everytime.
--------------------
This product is amazing!! I bought it because I put bone broth collagen in my coffee. It was taking me a minimum of five minutes to stir it up with a spoon, which would make my coffee cold. This hand held frothier stirred up and dissolved the collagen in less that 15 seconds. It is amazing!! ￼￼￼
--------------------
Saw every coffee lover I follow on Instagram use it and I had to get my own! It’s a staple at our house because we love coffee so much and I plan on using it to make an iced matcha latte soon with some almond milk!
--------------------
Bought this to make my cold brew concoctions extra fancy :) Made pumpkin spice cream & was not disappointed!!! Had to have one after I saw the gremlin make cold-brew on TikTok. No shame in my Basic game!!!
--------------------
As a basic frothed i would say that it completes its function. It is what I imagined it would do and does the job competently! I would say it’s no frills and if you heat your milk right you can get a decent froth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love it! it works excellent I use it daily two or three times a day I really recommend it
--------------------
Love this product! Makes stirring my morning coffee a breeze. Easy to make lattes and matcha :) Would definitely recommend to those looking to elevate their morning cup of joe at home or to those who do not want to spend a fortune on purchasing coffee. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I bought this after my coffee bar coffee pot stopped working. I got so used to my built in frother I didn't think I could have coffee without the froth. This tool is compact and does the job. I highly recommend to any coffee lovers that enjoy the extra goodness of froth from home. This product is easy to use and quiet! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Very easy to use right out of the box after adding batteries. I love the color and design. I use it all the time for my evening drinks. It even comes with a cute stand so I can display it with the rest of my coffee accessories.
--------------------
Makes great foam! I like the stand.
--------------------
Love this!!! Came super quick and came with the nicest note as they're a small business that's partnered with Target. I can't wait to use it and from the other reviews it seems like it's going to work great. Just unboxed it yesterday and already love it. And it's so affordable too!
--------------------
This is v nice, portable and easy to use milk frother. I love having having frothy milk with my coffee every day. It comes along with a stands So it looks more attractive n elegant. Its easy to use and saves time. All i can say is its lite in weight n pretty. I recommend this to all coffee fans. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have so enjoyed using the Zulay Frother! The ability to froth milk so easily for my morning coffee makes me happy and elevates my coffee drinking experience. The frother is so easy to use and clean. I like the stand it comes with so it can look good in my coffee station too! The only thing not included is batteries. You'll need 2 AA! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is a powerful, awesome little frother! It works really well, easy to clean, and the stand makes it take up little room on the countertop. It could also be used to make whipped cream, meringue, etc. the handwritten thank you note is a very Nice touch.
--------------------
I love this little hand held milk frother. I even use it for mixing other things up while cooking. Super easy to clean! I take a cup with soapy water and let it run for a few minutes. It comes with a stand so it sits nicely on the counter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Absolutely wonderful! So easy to use. The company is a family owned company and send a thank you note which is so lovely. I added a picture. I heated up a little half and half cream, and then used the Zulay.
--------------------
This is a wonderful product!! I used it for the 1st time with hot milk for my coffee and instantly fell in love with it. The frothy milk was absolutely perfect!!! I frothed the milk for like 2 mins amd it was so light and fluffy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who drinks coffee. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This works so wonderfully! I have taken my morning coffee to a whole new level. You have to be careful that you do not have much in your cup because this is so strong you will have a mess on your hands. I love whipping my creamer up into a froth and then add in my coffee. So yummy and so cheap compared to going out for coffee. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have mixed feelings about this product. On one hand, the product works well to mix your drinks and create a frothy top layer. But on the other hand I feel like the quality of the product is lacking. It feels like it is not made with quality materials. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This product is great! This product is battery operated only. It does not come with the double A batteries. I had a hard time putting my first battery in because it was new. I had to use a good amount of pressure on the first battery insert. After that it was smooth usage. I used this milk frother to frother my creamer for my ice coffee. It's not just for frothing milk. I used it to mix eggs for scrabbling and to mix pancake mix. It is worth the money. Easy to use and clean. You just put the small whisk end under hot water, turn on and it's clean. Has a lifetime warranty as well if you take the small amount of time to register your product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this milk frother to have at work to froth my heavy cream and mix my coffee. This milk frother works great and is easy to transport and take along throughout my day. This milk frother is super easy to use as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Works great! Also love the stand it comes with.
--------------------
This frother works great!  I love that this comes from a small mom and pop company.  They enclose a handwritten note.  Great customer service.  Highly recommend.
--------------------
Works perfectly and like the color options! tucks in the corner nicely by my coffee machine. easily mixes powder additions into my coffee-- there is literally no other way to do it well. ALSO- this is a family owned small biz, and totally where you should be putting your money if you are in need of a frother!
--------------------
I ordered this to make lattes at home.  It works well.  It fronts really fast.  The owners send a handwritten note in your package too. It was a nice touch.  I recommend this product.   I really like it
--------------------
I’m not sure how I lived so much of my life without this. Perfect milk foam every am for coffee!
--------------------
Small and very light weight. Very easy to use. Perfect for the job!
--------------------
Just what we were looking for
--------------------
The smell reminds me of a magnolia tree in bloom. It’s sweet and romantic. The smell is long lasting likes days. All love beauty and plant products are great to be honest
--------------------
This is a great product at a fantastic price point. It’s very hydrating without weighing down my type 2B/2C low porosity waves. It also works great on my daughters’ type 2A hair. We use it with the coordinating shampoo and have been very happy with them. The (lovely) scent is strong and does linger, so keep that in mind if you’re a perfume wearer. I typically don’t wear perfume, so it works double duty as a light fragrance as well. I’m planning to try the body wash from this line next for even more scent layering.
--------------------
This is the first time I write a review. So I hope you take mine into consideration. I have 2A to 2B hair type. My hair is really bipolar and finding a product that won’t make me lose my curls after a day is hard to find. I’ve heard a lot of good things about it so I decided to try this all clean product. After the first use I noticed that my hair was softer and less frizzy. My hair has always been frizzy. It noticeably saw a change on how vibrant and shiny my hair looked!!! Most of all, it defined my curls and waves which lasted for a couple of days until I showered again. I would definitely recommend this product. I absolutely love it and I LOVE the smell!!! It still lingers in my hair and doesn’t fade unlike other products. You also have to get the complimentary conditioner for full affect. I would recommend you apply the OGX Argan and Morocco oil to your hair while it’s still wet after showering. 10/10!!
--------------------
I adore this jasmine scent. It smells just like the flowers. It also reminds me of Chanel Gardenia perfume (first spritz not after notes) and Nest Bamboo Jasmine (Nest is a touch lighter.) It is not as heavy as my old favorite, Lush Flying Fox, but if you miss Flying Fox, you should try this. The shampoo and conditioner are great on my hair and it gives off a light jasmine scent all day. I’m hoping that they will make a body wash, bath bombs, and pump lotion too. Love.
--------------------
I really wanted to love this at first I thought I would it smells really good first con I noticed was that after use my hair still looked greasy, dirty and felt crunchy no matter how much I made sure to rinse out. I figured I'd at least finish the bottle and just wouldn't repurchase but then after a few weeks of use I noticed my scalp was growing increasingly itchy so I immediately discontinued use. there's something in this product that I must be allergic to.. overall very unimpressed for multiple reasons.
--------------------
I honestly only used this conditioner a few times. It seemed like the scent lingered in my hair a little longer than maybe other conditioners. And the scent smells lovely, very floral and perfume like, but it is WAY TOO STRONG for me personally. I am not super sensitive to scents, but there seem to be a handful like this one that just give me a headache. I may consider trying other shampoos or conditioners from the line. I may just need to buy from somewhere I can return the product in the event I can't actually use it.
--------------------
I have used this product once.  It is difficult to review how it works on my hair because I cannot get past the scent.  It I so strong I cannot stand it.
--------------------
I really love this conditioner. I been using Cantu line (all of its stuff) for about a year and it dried out of my hair. I used this conditioner and I love it. It gave me moisture and I was able to de-tangle my hair FLAWLESSLY. It smells wonderful. I use this as a leave in conditioner and it was able to rinse off nicely. I will always be using this product <3 I wished they had more for curly hair girls though!
--------------------
I love the smell of jasmine. So, I was excited when I did a search and came across Love Beauty and Planet coconut milk and white jasmine shampoo & conditioner. However, I was so disappointed when I smelled the shampoo & conditioner because it did not smell like jasmine as I was looking forward to. I looked at the ingredients and saw that jasmine is the 5th ingredient listed, but there is also "fragrance (parfum)" listed as the 9th ingrdient in the shampoo & 7th ingredient in conditioner. 

This "fragrance (parfum)" is obviously unnecessarily overpowering the smell of the shampoo & conditioner which is unfortunate because just the natural smell of jasmine and coconut would be preferable. I highly encourage Unilever & Love Beauty and Planet to remove this unnecessary ingredient. Removing the "fragrance (parfum)" ingredient will greatly enhance the shampoo and conditioner by allowing for the desired natural fragrance of jasmine and coconut and it will make the product even more environmentally friendly and naturally sourced. It will also decrease the products' EWG score (environmental working group - lower scores indicate healthier products), which serves as a guide for those interested in sustainable & healthy products. 

I really do hope Unilever & Love Beauty and Planet seriously consider this feedback. In the mean time, I will not be using or purchasing your products unless this is addressed. Thank you for your time and consideration.
--------------------
After years of searching for the perfect hair product for my daughters’ curly hair, I have finally found a product that I know I am sticking to. Every product we have tried has left their hair brittle and dry and worse off than before. We have tried so many products made especially for curly hair. We’ve tried some of the most expensive to some mid range products as well. 

This product not only smells beautiful, but also left their hair feeling so soft and smooth. 

I did also find that the product not only leaves their hair feeling soft and truly conditioned, but also does not leave it feeling weighed down. I find that many times their is a trade off, but that is not the case with this conditioner/shampoo combination.

I will update my review after a few weeks of use, but so far I am very impressed.
--------------------
This conditioner and shampoo are Great for curly hair doesnt , it doesn't weigh it down and helps with definition. Also, it smells amazing.
--------------------
This conditioner smells AMAZING! Sometimes I get a whiff of it and wonder where that amazing smell is coming from. Its from the conditioner! It is so moisturizing and texturizing. As the packaging says, it rinses quickly and is a clean brand!
--------------------
This smells great, and does really make my hair soooo soft, but its too heavy for my type of curls, its the type for curly hair but Im one of the cult girls that doesnt have super dry hair. This can make my hair limp and my curls super saggy.
--------------------
I really like the smell of this whole line of products. It doesnt leave any sort of film or residue on my hair after washing. It didnt seem to help with frizz or my curls/waves but my hair was soft.
--------------------
My favorite brand and one of my top scents! This brand is cruelty free and plant based with no nasty chemicals or hormone disrupters! LOVE!
--------------------
I received samples of The Love, Beauty & Planet Shampoo & Conditioner and I actually really like it. I have very thick, dry, wavy hair that sucks up any moisture and gets very tangled. Most drug store shampoos and conditioners normally do bot help my dehydrated locks but this one works great! My hair is smooth and hydrated and the price point is great. I will definitely be purchasing some soon.
--------------------
Complimentary from Love, Beauty & Planet, I received a FULL SIZE Coconut milk and White Jasmine Divine Definition Conditioner; For the purpose of this review, I chose to use this hair care system, daily and religiously. No other products were used on my hair during the testing process. I also wanted to wait until all products received were empty until completing this review, but despite usage frequency, the length and texture of my hair; the amount provided just seems to last forever. Definitely enough bang for your buck. Usually my conditioner runs out faster than my shampoo as I tend to use more often; However, not a lot of product was needed to saturate my thick locks from roots to ends so both the shampoo and conditioner stayed equal throughout the testing process. Very silky end result. The packaging is eye-catching and chic. The scent is very enjoyable but not overpowering. Very soft and subtle. Left my WAVY hair feeling weightless and manageable. Have repurchased this product, I'm in love!
--------------------
I love this smell so so much. It smells like something from my childhood, and I get compliments on the scent of my hair often now. Makes my hair so soft, nourishes my wavy hair, and is so affordable.
--------------------
Smells great but left my hair feeling more dry and brittle than ever. Even tried using it as a leave in conditioner also and still did nothing for me. One of the worst conditioners Ive ever tried.
--------------------
Love the conditioner just as much as the shampoo, this conditioner doesn't make my hair feel oily after using it and doesn't weigh my hair down
--------------------
smells super good and leaves my hair very smooth really plumps up my curls !!!!!!!!!
--------------------
I recently discovered Love Beauty and Planet products and I absolutely love them! I have been using the coconut shampoo and conditioner for a couple months and it leaves my hair so clean and soft. It has a very light and pleasant scent and lathers easily which I love because I don't have to use very much at a time. Highly recommend
--------------------
The Coconut Milk and White Jasmine shampoo and conditioner are divine! I love the scent combination and it leaves my hair soft and shiny every time I use it. I have color treated, medium length, wavy/curly hair. Due to an autoimmune disease called sarcoidosis, my hair is turning gray and falling out. So I need a shampoo and conditioner that give me volume, definition, moisturize, and won’t wash out all of my hair color. These products have been working quite well on my hair for the past few months. I will continue to use these products and recommend them to my friends and family.
--------------------
I like its i smeel so good and i like the texture of the peoduct its as a nice scent that last a long time and that what i love the must in this product,i like the body wash too but i prefer to us this product in my shower,i love alll the product that the brand offer
--------------------
This is a lovely conditioner! I have curly hair so I use this with shampoo once a week and then co-wash with it again later in the week and it works quite well for both days! The smell is a lovely light and fresh scent that isn't overbearing at all. Overall a great budget and vegan-friendly option.
--------------------
We just started using this recently and I love it! It smells amazing and it leaves your hair super soft. I have really curly hair and it helps control the frizz a little.
--------------------
This is one of my favourite brands and products. I use it every day that I wash my hair and it really helps with my curls and keeping my hair fresh looking (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
Love this brand it really helps my hair a lot would use it again. Not too pricey either
--------------------
I use this product on my daughters hair. She has beautiful bouncy curls, and this doesnt weigh then down at all. Its also natural ingredients so thats also a huge plus! It has a great fragrance and her hair is left tangle free.
--------------------
I love the long lasting scent of this conditioner and that it leaves my hair super soft.
--------------------
This is without a doubt my favorite scent for a hair care product, are use it with the conditioner and my hair still smells great even two days after! My hair is never frizzy or weighed down when I use this product. I was a very committed OGX consumer but I decided to give this a try and it now Im hooked, I also love the fact that it doesnt contain any yucky stuff for your hair
--------------------
Same as the shampoo,the smell of this is incredible. Though sometimes it feels like o dont get enough product in my hair but thats just because I cant get enough out of the bottle. I wish the packaging was a little higher but other than that its a great shampoo and conditioner.
--------------------
I have received this in a ripple street chatterbox campaign before our memorial day vacation. I have 3 kids that take forever to shower yet they come out still feeling like theres conditioner in their hair! Love beauty is a Godsend! Conditioner rinsed off easily but it didn't compromise the volume and cleanliness of our hair.
--------------------
This conditioner made my hair very oily, and I felt it weighed my hair down. The only upside is how good it smells, its not very strong but is pleasant. Overall, I was disappointed, because I love this brand, but this particular product was not for me.

--------------------
This is very moisturizing and I love how good the fragrance it left in my hair. Really made the hair soft and shiny also great detangler too, made it really easy to brush my frizzy/curly hair.
--------------------
I use this for my hair kind of expensive but love the way my hair feels after using it. My hair use to feel so dry and get tangled easily but with this its nice and soft
--------------------
Very nice I have extremely long thick hair and it dries my hair in half the time and leaves it smooth and soft and shiny. My 9 yr old loves it also not loud it's built to last unlike many rivals I'd give it a 10 out of 10
--------------------
Best conditioner out there! For the past recent month I had several of issues with my hair tried everything out there with dryness and flakes! This worked miracles!
--------------------
Love it love it love it. It leaves my hair so soft and so shiney I feel like I just went to the salon. The scent is not over powering which is great. Very light and subtle. I love how my hair feels and the fact there is no residue on my hair from the conditioner.
--------------------
I really like this conditioner. I love that the brand is a brand that aims to be ethnically responsible. They use ethnically sourced ingredients and use package that is 100% recyclable. I always feel like my hair is throughly nourished when I use this conditioner. The price is very affordable for the size of the bottle and you can find this on sale frequently.
--------------------
I absolutely love this conditioner. It smells heavenly and makes my hair so smooth and knot free. The fact its paraben and sulfate free make it the perfect product! I used to use just store brand junk but my hair was always "gummy" after and this conditioner is weightless and feels so clean still after using it.
--------------------
I like how this makes my hair look and smell. My hair is noticeably softer since Ive been using Love Beauty And Planet conditioner. This is the third scent Ive tried, and so far Ive loved all of them.
--------------------
I received a bottle of this and the shampoo complimentary from Influenster. I really enjoyed the shampoo, but I wasn't really very impressed with this.. Similar to the Rose I purchased I few months ago, this conditioner doesn't really penetrate and soften my hair like I'd like it to... It sort of has a waxy consistency which tends to just sit on top of the hair without really doing much... It does smell nice, but I just don't see myself repurchasing this one; although, I DO recommend the shampoo. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is a really great product! I absolutely love this brand especially their hair products. This conditioner smells so nice, but its also not one of those overwhelming smells either so if you like a light scent this is a good choice! My hair always feels so smooth and clean after using this conditioner!
--------------------
This conditioner does a great job detangling and moisturizing my hair without feeling too heavy. It also smells amazing! My only complaint is that I wish it came in a bigger bottle, because I have a lot of hair and go through shampoo/conditioner pretty quick. I've found bigger sizes of other products in stores, but not from this collection.
--------------------
Very calming conditioner. Conditioner calmed down my frizzy hair. I have natural curly hair and I usually have a lot of washing/styling issues with it. It also dried up the oil that was in my hair as well while making it softer/more manageable. It also smells great and just lightly tropical floral. I received this complementary for my honest review.
--------------------
This conditioner is amazing, it smells great and adds so much moisture to your hair, especially if it's coloured and lacking tlc! This is the best brand for beauty it's so gentle on your hair and I couldn't recommend it higher! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I received this product for free from ChickAdvisor. The first thing I noticed about the conditioner was the great, natural fragrance that was light enough without being overpowering. I found that after using the conditioner my hair felt smooth, silky, and soft. I will definitely use again in the future and would recommend! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I think that this was a great product, although I am not so sure that it is all natural and organic. I still smelt the chemicals in in. I think that the scent was lovely though. The combination was a great uplifting scent that I did enjoy. It was really smoothing for my hair and I would probably use it again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
This conditioner does wonders for your curls. Leaves them bouncy and doesnt weigh them down. Amazing scent and great price. You only need a little product.
--------------------
This conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft, shiny, and my curly waves are more manageable. The coconut milk is also hydrating. I also love that it is plant based and ethically sourced, making it less harsh on our environment. Being free of harsh chemicals is a big plus. Even the bottles are made from recyclable materials that can be recycled as well. I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. #lovebeautyandplanet Love Beauty And Planet Coconut Milk & White Jasmine Conditioner [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Really liked using this conditioner! I use it after the shampoo from the same line and my hair feels so soft afterwards, it's amazing. It also detangles better than any other product I've tried, I couldn't stop running my hands through my hair. Really love the smell of it too, perfect for days when I just shower and leave my curls natural/unstyled because the smell just makes it feel so fresh and effortless. It also helps with curl definition when I use it and let my hair dry naturally, or after I use it and comb my hair when dry, I get perfect Beach Waves. Can't recommend it enough!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I loved the smell of this product and really enjoy that its a more natural product than a lot on the market. I love that this product line is also available at the shoppers drug mart close to my house, so I dont have to go actively searching for it somewhere. I definitely think I would use this product again, and am really grateful that I recieved it for free so that I could try it first from Chickadvisor. Definitely worth buying!

When I received this conditioner I had some doubts, Vegan usually doesn't seem to work well with my hair leaving it hard to work with and feeling hard. I have to say that this conditioner actually worked and my hair looks and feels amazing. I didn't have to use a lot like I thought I would either. It smells a little strong when you first open the bottle but when you are finished and your hair is dry it has a nice mellow aroma. I would happily recommend this product to a friend or family member. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

I got this free sample from ChickAdvisor. I like the jasmine smell and it makes my hair smells good. Also it makes my hair feels silky after using. I will buy this product again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

Love beauty and planet never disappoints! This conditioner smells great and goes really well with the shampoo. It makes my hair really soft and the smell lasts for a long time after as well. Would recommend. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

I am loving this line it leaves my hair feeling soft and full of volume and smells amazing! I have very damaged hair from over colouring and this conditioner gives my hair some much needed nourishment! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

I loved the creamy texture but especially the unique scent. I was pleased with the way it left the feeling of my hair. Not heavy at all. I would definitely recommend. Thank you for letting my try this for free! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
This product is amazing. It does a great job at conditioning my long hair and it smells unreal. The smell also lingers for a few days! The texture is a thick consistency as well. Value wise; its great! Normal pricing; although, I do feel I use more than normal. I do recommend! #FreeProduct (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I really loved the Love Beauty & Planet Coconut Milk & White Jasmine Divine Definition Conditioner! It smells wonderful, very fresh and floral. It is not too thick like some conditioners can be. I feel like this gets my hair feeling very clean without stripped of moisture. I have very long and tangle-prone hair, and this conditioner makes my hair so much easier to brush after I get out of the shower! It leaves my hair very smooth and less frizzy, which in turn leaves less tangles. Love that it is cruelty-free and vegan and uses organic and ethically-sourced ingredients. The only downside, in my opinion, is cost. The bottle is pretty small and it is pretty pricey. I have long hair down to the small of my back so I would go through a bottle like this in less than a month. That said, it has many benefits over most conditioners on the market and to me is worth the extra money. I received this product free from Chick Advisor in exchange for my honest review. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

#gotitfree from chickadvisor Love the smell of the jasmine and coconut together Very light weight conditioner and I love the fact that it’s eco friendly and organic! The bottle is a good size , I look forward to purchasing different scents ! Thank you for the free sample! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
Loved it so much! This conditioner did not weigh my hair down at all! It kept my wavy curls bouncy and light. It rinsed our so quickly and without effort. Smells fantastic and left my hsif feeling soft and silky! AND it’s vegan! I’m very happy this line is a great valued line of options. I got this free from chick advisor in exchange for my honest review. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

This conditioner is absolutely fantastic!! Using it after the shampoo is absolutely great! My hair felt nice, silky,soft. But the smell is what made me a fan!! Unbelievable how fantastic this/these products smell!! Definitely buying the duo!! Highly recommend it!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
Just like the shampoo I tested, this conditioner also has an awesome scent that lasts for quite a while! My hair felt light as no residue was left in it at all and omg the softness!! It was like I had perfect baby hair all over again! I have naturally curly hair so frizz is something I'm very familiar with :( after using this conditioner for a few days I noticed a very noticeable reduction of the frizz and a remarkable change in my hairs over all appearance, It was super soft, lightweight, and shiny! I had no idea how much my other products weighed my hair down until I stopped using them... a total eye opener for sure! It is a little pricier then other conditioners on the market but it's a great product and worth every penny, I would definitely use this conditioner again and again! ** I received this product for free for the purpose of testing it. While I was testing this product I did not use any other products so I would be able to give an honest review so the only products used on my hair during the testing period was the Love Beauty and Planet hair care products I was testing :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

This conditioner smells so lovely and really leaves your hair nice and soft. A little goes a long way! The bottles are a little difficult to dispense product though! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
This conditioner didn't do much for my hair other than smell nice. My hair is naturally dry and this conditioner didn't make my hair feel nourished and I noticed it lacked that aspect I look for in a good conditioner which is helping to make my hair feel soft. It might of helped to give it some shine and maybe make it a little less knotty but that's about it. Unfortunately, I won't be reaching for this because my hair needs something more moisturizing. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
My hair goes half way down my back and it's wavy/curly so conditioner is important for me. This did not disappoint! Went on easily and helped detangle my hair. While drying my hair was noticibly softer with a nice scent! I really can't get over how fabulous this line smells! This is going to be a regular in my shower. *I received this product for free to give my honest review of it* (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
This conditioner was a life saver for my dry frizzy hair! My hair felt so soft as I was rinsing it out of my hair and it was so easy to comb my hair after. The biggest difference I've noticed is that my hair is no longer frizzy since I've switched my conditioner. I am very impressed with the quality of this conditioner and the ingredients in it. I think that it is suitable for all hair types and I am lucky to have received it free for testing or I'd be missing out. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I love this conditioner from Love Planet & Beauty. I dye my hair and I find it gets easily dried out but with this condioner it feels so silky smooth and I find it gives my hair added volume. I would definatley recommend this product to friends and family. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I love the scent of this conditioner ! it has a refreshing scent. It makes my hair super smooth and soft with a hint of a suttle glow. It makes my hair look super healthy again even though its really damaged by all heat! ive recieved this from chickadvisor for free and i will definetly purchase again! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
There's something refreshingly nostalgic about this conditioner, from the way it dispenses in a creamy ribbon to the mild weight of it in your hair. It's not mega-rich and heavy, but a lovely product to use on curls between shampoos. Simple, clean, and effective. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I received this product from ChickAdvisor to try & review! I love this conditioner! It leaves my hair mega soft, and smells so good! It pairs so well with the shampoo of the same brand. :) Would recommend! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
This is a reliable, basic conditioner, comparable to any drugstore product. The biggest benefit is the lack of negative ingredients, and that it does a fine job at reducing frizz and helping define waves or curls. The biggest downfalls for me are the scent (nice enough but not something I would choose myself) and that as you use more of the product, it becomes difficult to dispense (pressure builds up and you really need to squeeze it/shake it). It makes the label look wrinkled and worn and sometimes causes the bottle to dent, making it harder to use (and taking away from a spa-like shower experience!). You won't be disappointed but you won't be blown away, so if the price is right for you, go for it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I am in love with this hair conditioner once it’s paired with the shampoo. This conditioner leaves my hair so smooth and I don’t even need to use another serum or a detangler for my hair. My hair usually is very dry and I always need to add hair serum for more hydration but not anymore with this awesome duo. The price point and the Ingrediants are also a plus point of this product. I will be trying other products from this line for sure. Thank you Chickadvisor for letting me trying this product for free. #gotitfree (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
Similar to my review with the shampoo I was hesitant, I actually brought my regular conditioner into the shower with me in case I needed it. When you have super thick, heavy and wavy hair like mine, conditioner can be your best friend or in some cases your enemy. I made sure to follow instructions and apply it from mid hair down to the ends, gently massaging it into the hair. As I was rinsing my hair felt silky smooth and soft. My hair felt nourished as it was air drying and was easier to comb through than other times before I stared using this product. I have now used them together a few times and I have noticed a change in how my hair feels, handles and holds up. I love it and will be continuing to use this as my main go-to. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I tried this conditioner 4 times and I hated the way it made my hair feel. It did not enhance my curls whatsoever and left a film on my got no matter how much I washed it. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product. The only good thing about it was the smell as it does smell amazing. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
My new favorite conditioner hands down! I couldn't believe how soft and smooth my hair felt after rinsing. I loved the silky texture and amazing definition my curls had after using this product. Thank you to Chick Advisor & Love Beauty Planet for sending me a complementary bottle, I will definitely be purchasing this product when it runs out! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
First what really comes into the view, - ingredients it's made with. They are way ahead and healthier than in most similar products of the other brands around. And it is nicely enchants and defines my hair. Which I very liked about. Very nice texture and a pleasant - pleasant scent of Jasmine...mmmm-hmmm . The "ECO" touch to the product is just another bonus to combine - pleasant with needed. Great product. A YES from me (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I do not use many conditioners very often however out this on my end and it made my hair so soft and is perfect for when curling hair leaves it smooth and looking fresh really enjoy this and the bottle giant so that a perk to (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
This conditioner like the rest of this product line, I am in love with! The scent is so nice and natural. I also really love how this conditioner works on my daughters curly hair, I find it so much easier to manage after we condition with this. For me this product is great because not only is it great for me, it is great for my daughter as well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
Really love this conditioner as it contains no sulfates, smells great and leaves my hair moisturized. Would recommend buying if you want a natural option for your hair + it goes on sale in Walmart! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I found this conditioner I do a nice job of light conditioning. It did not weigh my hair down and had a nice pleasing scent. If you’d hsir is dry you might need a stronger conditioning product. I don’t like the bottle design as I find it hard to dispense. Other than that I have no complaints! This is a nice product for curly hair. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
This conditioner smells amazing! The best part for me is this conditioner is Curly Girl Methid approved! It leaves my hair feeling and smelling so nice and I have had some if the best curls ever while using it. My only issue is the bottle itself. It is tricky to squeeze the conditioner out after only a few uses as the bottle kind of crunches in on itself. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
Used in combination with the shampoo, there was a noticeable difference in the texture and feeling of my hair: my hair felt and looked thicker and was less frizzy. With the use of this conditioner my hair also felt a bit less dry and was easy to brush through. The scent of this conditioner is rather enjoyable, however if you are someone who is sensitive to scents or does not like floral scents, then I would steer away from this product as it is a bit on the stronger side. I do appreciate the fact that plant based ingredients and recycled bottles for their packaging are used! I typically buy my hair products from a salon but I would consider buying this in the future. Note: I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes. All opinions are my own. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I received this product complimentary from Chick Advisor and I'm so thankful I did! This is the perfect pairing to go with the coconut milk & white jasmine shampoo. It gives my curly hair beautiful softness and manageability, and I'm able to run my fingers through my hair without getting them all tangled. I have less frizz and dryness too which I love. My hair hasn't looked this good in months! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
The smell is really great but I felt my hair a bit dry after the first use. Maybe in the long run will have a different effect. Loved all the naturals ingredients in it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I was excited to have the chance to try the Love Beauty & Planet Coconut Milk & White Jasmine Divine Definition Conditioner thanks to the Chick Advisor Review club. I immediately loved the packaging as it is fresh, clean and chic looking. The conditioner has a great scent and it made my hair feel so nourished. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
The way these products leave your hair smelling and feeling is amazing. Clean, light and managable! You don’t need a ton of product either like some conditioners. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I'm really thankful Chickadvisor gave me a chance to try Love and Beauty Planet Coconut Milk and White Jasmine condition because I wouldn't have otherwise known about its effectiveness and quality. My hair is a bit wavy and this conditioner did not weigh down my hair at all, leaving it really soft. I liked the scent, however I thought the Jasmine scent was a bit too strong and overpowering the coconut scent rendering the latter to be not noticeable to the nose at all. But overall, I really liked the effectiveness of this hair conditioner and I really love the natural aspect of it. This is a great product for every hair type in my opinion, not just curly hair. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
This conditioner smells so nice. It’s so refreshing and the smell lasts in your hair long after the shower. It really smooths out my hair and doesn’t make it frizzy. It lathers nicely and I really liked the texture. Very nice overall (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
#tryitforfree My pom boy Tijuan(and I) gives his approval vote! #tryitforfree The jasmine smell is strong and would like to smell more coconut(as coconut is more friendly and easier going smell for others im around at work as not everyone wants to smell flowers especially those who have sensitive noses) but the overall smell is lovely. The conditioner, since being 90%+natural serves as a body moisturizer while in the shower. It did not leave my hair limp. I have wavy, straight and curly hair(around the frame of my face). The product nutures my hair and gives my waves and curls a soft definition. I color my hair so, it did not appear to affect the color, tone, or longevity of brightness. I LOVE that it is cruelty free A little goes a long way! I even shared it with my boyfriend who enjoyed the fact how its made with natural ingredients, cruelty free and environmentally loving! I look forward to checking out their other products and will spread the love to family and friends Thanks for allowing me to try for free! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

Love love love this conditioner! Usually conditioner makes my hair greasy because I have very fine hair, but this one works wonders! Only need a little bit to make hair shiny and beautiful, therefore it will last a long time. AMAZING SCENT (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

I love this conditioner. Light weight and doesn't leave my hair greasy. Helps with Friz and shine. It has a beautiful scent to it and isn't overpowering (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I got to test this From ChickAdvisor and I’m so grateful. It smells so good. It’s so soft. I’m so shocked that it makes my hair so soft and most importantly tangle free. My hair is always tangled but not since I’ve been using Love Beauty And Planet Conditioner. #FreeProduct #tryLoveBeautyPlanet (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
Love this Conditioner. The smell is unbelievable. It smells incredible. I use it with the shampoo and It leaves my hair soft with an incredible shine. I will be purchasing this product again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I would definitely buy this product again I was so happy with it. I have very long coloured hair so finding a good conditioner is essential. The smell is really nice it’s not overwhelming it was pleasant. The conditioner is nice and thick so you don’t end up having it run out your hand before you reach your head so major bonus there. Also left my hair with a nice shine and really soft. I did have only one negative it was the bottle I found it to be a little tough to squeeze as it was getting low. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
LOVE BEAUTY & PLANET COCONUT MILK & WHITE JASMINE DIVINE DEFINITION CONDITIONER was a new product for me and I was fascinated with their claim “fast-rinse technology” - so I put that to the test! My old conditioner did need quite a bit of rinsing, to ensure it was not leaving a greasy oily scalp or film. This conditioner rinsed much faster and my hair felt very nourished, sleek and not a bit greasy. I really liked the subtle White Jasmine fragrance, very exotic. My hair did appear to have more shine and the company claims this is from 100% Organic Coconut Oil which also gives definition and curl to my normally frizzy wavy hair. The bottle was easy to open, although I prefer rectangle shaped containers for my narrow shower shelves, this one did fit. I appreciated reading about this company and why they are called Love Beauty and Planet - they are seriously committed to “small acts of love for the planet” and this is evident by their 100% recycled packaging, which I found to be very attractive. So many good things about this company, I hope they are a big success. I will buy their products again and highly recommend LOVE BEAUTY & PLANET COCONUT MILK & WHITE JASMINE DIVINE DEFINITION CONDITIONER after trying it for two weeks. #trylovebeautyplanet #gotitfree @chickadvisor (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
When I was assigned this product, I was SO excited. I love anything with coconut milk and jasmine. I was slightly less enthused when I tried the product. I found the smell was a bit overwhelming. I could smell it on me all day, anyone who works in a scentfree environment could not get away with using this. That being said, the product was good. My hair felt soft, and didn't need much conditioner to make it feel that way. It is a good value for sure! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
Literally does not clean your hair. Left way greasier after washing
--------------------
This shampoo does not clean your hair. I wanted so badly to like this but I have to shampoo my hair significantly more than any shampoo I've ever used to get it clean. I've never used a shampoo that doesn't clean hair and I've used so many brands.
--------------------
Great smell, terrible product..leaves my hair feeling greasy
--------------------
I wanted to love this so much, but unfortunately it did nothing great for me. I got one of the tester-sized bottles and I'm glad I did because I will not be buying the full product. This shampoo made my hair so dry and itchy--which never happens to me from shampoo! I thought it could have been lice it was getting so dry and itchy. I'm glad others have had good luck but it's not made for my hair. 2b, medium porosity, low density.
--------------------
Never had a shampoo & conditioner that leaves my hair greasier than not washing my hair. Even with the smallest amount of product and thorough washing, hair is greasier than before washing. Based on other reviews, seems to work for some but definitely not all. Wish I saved my receipt to return.
--------------------
I love the message of this brand and I love buying from a brand that cares for the planet. However, this shampoo and the matching conditioner don’t work for me. I have a dry scalp, and naturally (a little oily) curly hair. Every time I use it my scalp is super dry but my hair is SUPER oily. I would love for this to work but my hair feels worse after using this product.
--------------------
Soo wanted to love this shampoo. It smells great and lathers well. But it stripped my hair and left it bone dry. Had to deep condition then re-wash with (another) moisturizing shampoo. Not for me.
--------------------
I really wanted to like this product. I tend to go for environmentally friendly, natural products for curly hair. My hair is also dyed so the “sulfate free” title on the front was what sold it for me. I have used this three times, and each time had the same results. It left behind a greasy, oily residue that felt so heavy and gross, I had to spray dry shampoo in my hair after it dried. My hair was dull, not shiny and flat. It looked as though I never washed it. It feels heavy when I put it on, like no matter what it won’t spread around in my hair. It also felt like it wouldn’t wash out, even though I rinsed for at least 5 minutes. The pros are the smell, and the packaging is cute. I’m not sure how anybody can stand this heavy feeling in their hair but it’s definitely not for me. Gave it two stars because I like the idea of having environmentally friendly hair products.
--------------------
I've been using LBP for a while now, nd I ABSOLUTELY ADORE IT! But every time it gets harder and harder to find the Coconut Milk & White Jasmine collection plus there are very a few items... Need tu push this collection to the same level as the Lavender or Rose collections, smells 1000000000 times better!! Also, why is this particular collection more expensive than the others?
--------------------
Love that it suds up, makes my scalp feel so clean!
--------------------
Okay so I have 2B hair. It borders between wavy and curly and recently I cut it short to try and get some health back in it. Well. This product seemed perfect, it seems so clean! But with my fine hair? Dear lord it’s so heavy! I think it’d be great for other hair textures but for my finer hair I look like I need an oil change as soon as I’m out of the shower. I hate it, because the price can’t be beat and the scent is incredible, this product just doesn’t work for me :/
--------------------
I’m always hunting for shampoos/conditioners that will define my curls/waves. Depending on what I use to wash and style, sometimes some waves/curls end up straighter and look weird with the parts on my hair that went full curly. 

I used this shampoo/conditioner and nothing for styling, and my hair came out with my curls defined. Exactly what I wanted. 

The only downside is the scent is super faint. I hope they come out with shampoo for curly hair that has a stronger scent.

Love that the brand is eco friendly.
--------------------
My hair has never been more dry than after using this shampoo. It made my hair feel absolutely disgusting the next day
--------------------
Smells great and makes my hair very soft and look very healthy
--------------------
This is helping me get back to my curls! Love the scent too
--------------------
Great smell but leaves my hair looking and feeling greasy. My hair will not cooperate at all after using this shampoo and conditioner. I purchased based off of it having good reviews but I’m not sure how people are saying it’s a good product . I kept giving it chance after chance thinking maybe it was just my hair being weird but after reading the low star reviews I see it’s a common thing and I do not have oily hair normally. My hair is actually pretty dry. I will not be purchasing again and will be testing products for myself from now on and not just relying on reviews since obviously the reviews aren’t accurate.
--------------------
I love the smell of jasmine. So, I was excited when I did a search and came across Love Beauty and Planet coconut milk and white jasmine shampoo & conditioner. However, I was so disappointed when I smelled the shampoo & conditioner because it did not smell like jasmine as I was looking forward to. I looked at the ingredients and saw that jasmine is the 5th ingredient listed, but there is also "fragrance (parfum)" listed as the 9th ingrdient in the shampoo & 7th ingredient in conditioner. 

This "fragrance (parfum)" is obviously unnecessarily overpowering the smell of the shampoo & conditioner which is unfortunate because just the natural smell of jasmine and coconut would be preferable. I highly encourage Unilever & Love Beauty and Planet to remove this unnecessary ingredient. Removing the "fragrance (parfum)" ingredient will greatly enhance the shampoo and conditioner by allowing for the desired natural fragrance of jasmine and coconut and it will make the product even more environmentally friendly and naturally sourced. It will also decrease the products' EWG score (environmental working group - lower scores indicate healthier products), which serves as a guide for those interested in sustainable & healthy products. 

I really do hope Unilever & Love Beauty and Planet seriously consider this feedback. In the mean time, I will not be using or purchasing your products unless this is addressed. Thank you for your time and consideration.
--------------------
Before I tried this product I had been using Aussie Miracle Curls Shampoo and OCG Coconut Conditioner but I noticed my hair had become weighed down, frizzy and oily after a day. My curls wouldn't curl on their own, they ended up looking dog ears, super sad. The thing I LOVE about using the LOVE Beauty and Planet Coconut and Jasmine shampoo + conditioner is that there are no sulfates, and the product doesn't overly lather when washing up. There are some suds but not overwhelming!!! The smell is fantastic... and get this........ MY HAIR IS WEIGHTLESS AND MY CURLS ARE EFFORTLESS. I'm not kidding you guys.... I don't touch my hair a single time and it curls so beautifully. I feel so confident. Can't beat the price of this product either!!
--------------------
With Coconut Milk and White Jasmine , this Shampoo helps define and enhance my hair with a lightweight formula. This luxurious shampoo is made with a plant-based cleanser and infused with Organic Coconut Oil. I eat a plant based diet so i diffenitly would choose the same for my hair
--------------------
The smell of this shampoo make you feel like you are on a tropical island. Your hair will also feel amazing afterwards as well. Worth every penny for the experience.
--------------------
I tried the rose scented shampoo while crashing at a friend's and loved it! When shopping for new shampoo I decided to go with this scent. It smells very lovely and the smell lasts in your hair. However after at the end of a long day I find that my hair does get weighed down and oily. If your hair tends to be on the oilier side as mine does, I would advise against this specific shampoo.
--------------------
I love this shampoo. It smells great and lathers up very nicely. Leaves my hair feeling soft.
--------------------
Smells amazing. I use the conditioner as a leave in when I want to curl my hair. Love this line.
--------------------
The entire Love Beauty & Planet range of shampoos is absolutely incredible - there are no harsh chemicals that are normally involved when buying store bought shampoos so this shampoo leaves your hair feeling smooth, silky and nourished. It really gives you that bouncy hair feeling you get walking out of a salon! The scent is absolutely incredible and lasts on your hair, it is strong enough to notice but not too overpowering.
--------------------
My all time favorite shampoo!! Hair is left feeling soft and manageable, yet voluminous and light. I wish they offered this in the bigger sized bottles. The scent is glorious and long lasting. Get your hands on this!
--------------------
Absolutely love this shampoo! Leaves my hair moisturized and with a nice shine! I have curly, frizzy hair and this shampoo helps with the frizz!
--------------------
I LOVE this shampoo. Its vegan, and works so well with my hair. I love how pure the company is, and its love for our planet. The bottle is recycled and the nutrients are all plant based. This is my go-to shampoo.
--------------------
It smells so good great product I highly recommend it! Love its eco friendly! Smells very good and pretty bottle!!!!! No improvement needed! Keep new products coming Ill definitely buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
--------------------
I love this brand of body wash so I decided to try the shampoo. I purchased the shampoo and conditioner together. Although the creamy body wash is still my favorite, I love the packaging style and smell of this product.
--------------------
I use this brand regular.I love their ethos and fact no nasty additives.I use their shower gel and have used shampoo and conditioner before.One of things I love about this brand is their products smell lush and that was first thing I noticed about this there was no or very little scent but I forged ahead.I was so disappointed as this as a shampoo didn’t feel rich and creamy and didn’t lather well but worse than that once my hair was dried it still felt greasy.I was so disappointed especially as is a brand I love.Im afraid to say used rest of bottle as shampoo for dogs
--------------------
I would not buy this product again simply because it doesnt work as advertised and quite frankly is overpriced for the quality that it comes in. This product does not work at all and had to throw it out because it gave me dandruff.
--------------------
LOVE the smell of this- I get tons of compliments! Scent lasts a long time as well! I would suggest selling in a larger bottle. Great for dry scalp, I do find I need to use more than I would other products. Cant wait to buy again!
--------------------
Absolutely love this shampoo, it is sulfate free. It has a great smell and leaves hair shiny and soft. It is alittle expensive but well worth the extra couple of bucks! I am overall satisfied with this product!
--------------------
Just tried this for the first time and I liked it, my hair feels nice ish but I think it made it kinda dry? And my roots oily...I think it's compensating for the dryness because that happened before with a different brand!
--------------------
Complimentary from Love, Beauty & Planet, I received a FULL SIZE Coconut milk and White Jasmine Divine Definition Shampoo; For the purpose of this review I chose to use this hair care system, daily and religiously. No other products were used on my hair during the testing process. I also wanted to wait until all products received were empty until completing this review, but despite usage frequency and the length of my hair; the amount provided just seems to last forever. Definitely enough bang for your buck. The packaging is eye-catching and chic. The scent is very enjoyable. It made my bathroom smell like paradise. Just a small amount provides a thick, foamy lather. After just one wash I could notice the difference. My untamable hair was much easier to style. My friends three year old daughter told me my hair looked and smelled beautiful the first day I used it, and we all know kids don't lie. After finishing the bottle, my wavy hair was much more defined and less frizzy. I am absolutely in love with this shampoo! Have repurchased following receiving complimentary set!
--------------------
this product is perfect and cheap too it is very good quality.And smells good while keeping your hair very clean.If your are looking for a cheap product that is better for the planet i would definitely recommend it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I absolutely love this shampoo! A little goes along way and leaves your hair feeling silky soft and smelling so fragrant. This has become my new go to shampoo. It is super affordable and readily available. Pair it with the conditioner for even better results. Love Beauty And Planet
--------------------
This shampoo is nicely cleansing, with a subtle scent. As I do CGM, I only use it when I need to clarify with a chelating shampoo, because I need the sulfate to clear out polyquat and hard water build-up, and it works well for this. I love that it's cruelty free, non-gmo, and the company has good practices!
--------------------
Love Beauty and Planet is a great brand. The shampoo is amazing. It leaves tour hair feeling soft and refreshing. It works about the same as other brands, even expensive ones. I would definitely buy this again!
--------------------
Honestly this stuff is pretty great, I use it on both my wigs and normal hair, I have curl to my hair and the Jasmine scent helps that curl show, the smell infests the house and stays in my hair for says, the boyfriend approves and always compliments it so thats a bonus
--------------------
Cleaned very well and smells amazing. But did not feel nourishing whatsoever. Would not recommend.
--------------------
Refreshing wash for my hair. It gave my hair life and it smellls soooooooo goooodddd. The smell is long last throughout the whole day. Your hair feels like silk and its so refreshing to my curls.
--------------------
Love the smell, doesn't weight my hair down at all, really good for dry scall in my opinion, probably my favorite shampoo lately cant wait to try all the other scents they have
--------------------
I wanted to love this so much. The smell is so nice and I am a sucker for good smelling shampoo. But every time I use this shampoo and conditioner, I lose more hair than normal. I feel like it kind of dries it out and makes it more brittle. I am giving it 3 stars for the scent alone but I wont be buying again
--------------------
This shampoo and conditioner smelled really good but it was highly potent. The smell didnt bother me but it lasted in my hair which I liked. It didnt really make a difference for my hair.
--------------------
I had been using Suave for a long time and was seeing that my curls were not as defined as they typically are. I decided to switch things up since Ive been transitioning toward clean products so I tried this one. I love it. My curls are more defined and my hair feels much softer and smoother.
--------------------
Does a good job. The smell first and foremost is amazing. It lathers well and helps to get rid of dirt and product gunk. I have others that I have used in the past that I liked more but tried it to see what I liked. I love the smell first but would love something that didnt leave my hair as frizzy.
--------------------
I'm new to naturally curly hair. After recovering from an illness, my hair turned curly. Crazy, right?! I'm still learning how to deal with it. I have tried dozens of shampoos/conditioners but none have given me the weightless softening moisture I need. After two uses of both this shampoo and the coordinating conditioner, my hair is not frizzy, not dry, not dull, not limp, not any of the things that had me contemplating a pixie cut. I only need a quick spritz hair spray (from the same line) and my curls hold, shine, and bounce!
--------------------
Not only does this smell great, but it leaves my hair super soft, shiny, and makes my waves bouncy and vibrant. I love these products!
--------------------
love this product makes me hair feel so good and bouncy afterwards so happy to have it in my shower routine!
--------------------
This conditioner is very hydrating and defines my low porosity hair really well! I would defiantly buy this again!
--------------------
I have straight hair and got this specifically for the scent...I didnt care it, doesnt matter! Smelled that good...however its heavy on my hair makes my hair not feel clean...
--------------------
Im loving this shampoo!! After trying a bunch of sulfate free shampoos I decided to give these a try after seeing them come out. Its my favorite one so far and it has a pretty good price. Its smells delicious and leaves my hair clean and helps form my curls. I also use their conditioner. Ive only tried this one from their line but its working for me. I have very thin 2c hair and tends to get greasy, so with this one I can at least wash it every other day. These are the second bottles I get and I would buy again!
--------------------
Im obsessed with this shampoo! My husband and I just started using it a few months ago and we are totally hooked! We both have curly hair and this is amazing. It doesnt dry our hair out and it makes our hair so soft, without getting oily. The smell is ridiculously yummy and the price is well worth the quality of the product!
--------------------
This is one of my favourite brands and products. I use it every day that I wash my hair and it really helps with my curls and keeping my hair fresh looking (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
Love that I get to help the earth and my hair! I love it and the jasmine coconut milk smells amazing!! Worth the bucks for this!
--------------------
My daughter purchased and I decided to try as I'm pretty picky with shampoo and just love it and would also buy my own .It has a great smell and organic so even better. I love the feel of my hair and softness after just one use .I think its my new go to shampoo for sure (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
This shampoo has the best scent and its long lasting. It also has a great lather. A little goes a long way which is great for my thick wavy hair.Love Beauty and Planet Coconut Milk & White Jasmine Shampoo
--------------------
I absolutely love this shampoo! Doesn’t dry it out like others do. A little goes a long way and lathers very well. Only downside, price is a little high for a small bottle.
--------------------
This shampoo is 100% my current obsession, I cannot get enough of the fresh scent and my hair has never felt softer. I use it with the conditioner and it is definitely a winning combination, moisturized but not weighted down and no frizz
--------------------
I love the smell of this product! The packaging also is adorable and I love that theres no bad ingredients in these products either! It seems to do wonders for my very curly hair! :) Im definitely going to buy more!
--------------------
Started using this after I finished the rose one. It lathers real nice, and a little goes a long way. I would put this in a pump bottle. Love the smell, can be a little strong. Really satisfied, this is for curly hair and helping frizz.
--------------------
I got a lot of samples at BeautyconNYC and this shampoo was one of them. It smells amazing. I tried once and seems to work great. I just wanted to finish my other product first. I am really liking all there products.
--------------------
Was a great product for a reasonable price and the best it left my hair feeling clean and hydrated after the shower.
--------------------
This shampoo smells absolutely lovely! This brand is a little pricey for me, but seems to live up to the cost in quality. I tend to have a dry scalp, and I found that this shampoo doesnt help with that - certainly doesnt make it worse though. The paired conditioner does wonders for dry hair though!
--------------------
This shampoo smells so good. But between this, and the conditioner it weighed my hair down, and I noticed my hair had gotten very oily. I love this brand, but this shampoo was a no go for me.
--------------------
Love that there are no parabens dyes or sulfates in this incredible product. Leaves my hair so smooth after every wash, never heavy, and I can go longer between washes too@
--------------------
I really like this product. It's good for the environment and it smells very good. It does what a shampoo is supposed to do, clean the hair. It isnt the best that I used of this brand, it creates a lot of frizzy hair compared to the others. I would probably buy it again.
--------------------
Complimentary from Love, Beauty & Planet, I received a FULL SIZE Coconut milk and White Jasmine Divine Definition Shampoo; For the purpose of this review I chose to use this product daily and religiously. No other products were used on my hair during the testing process. I also wanted to wait until all products received were empty until completing this review, but despite usage frequency and the length of my hair; the amount provided just seems to last forever. Definitely enough bang for your buck. The packaging is eye-catching and chic. The scent is very enjoyable. It made my bathroom smell like paradise. Just a small amount provides a thick, foamy lather. After just one wash I could notice the difference. My untamable hair was much easier to style. My friends three year old daughter told me my hair looked beautiful the first day I used it, and we all know kids don't lie. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I purchased this as I was in need of a new shampoo and heard great things about this company. I was pleasantly surprised! My hair felt so clean and love the smell! I felt my hair seemed to have more body too which is hard to come by for my hair. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone! You won't be disappointed! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I bought this product to try something new since my regular shampoo had gone up in cost and didnt have a sale going on. It was a great price for how much you get. I love the smell of it and so far it seems to be working well in my hair. I also love how they care about the environment and are making sure to not leave much waste in production. I'm proud to support any brand that takes the time to care about their environmental impact.
--------------------
This has a super fresh smell and leaves my hair feeling soft and I love that it's all natural! I dye my hair so I need paraben free products so that I dont wash out my color in a week. Overall I would definitely recommend this to a friend! Very nice! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
received this for free through the chick advisor product review club. The scent is refreshing and pleasant. The shampoo lathers up nicely and washes out easily with no flakes or residue. The fact its environmentally friendly is a fantastic bonus as I prefer natural products. Widely available at grocery stores everywhere. I definitely will be out to get more once its out. She loves it!
--------------------
My hair is shining and bouncy and. Looks so healthy and the smell, so good. I smell like a candle lol
--------------------
LOVE this shampoo! I am absolutely in love with this shampoo because it makes me feel like I just got shampooed at a salon. My hair feels so soft and looks shiney with no residue left on my hair. The scent is very light so I don't feel like it would clash with purfumes or what ever you may wear in addition to using the shampoo. Love it, recommend for sure.
--------------------
I really like this shampoo. It smells very nice. Also it made my hair feel healthy and shiny. I love that this product is all natural and their packaging is really nice. However the price is a little high for the amount you get. I find that I go through a bottle faster then my old shampoo. Overall I am very satisfied with the product and would definitely recommend. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
In love with this product, its organic and smells amazing! My hair feels so smooth and silky. I wouldnt improve anything on this product it smells wonderful and can totally smell it on your hair. I will buy again.
--------------------
I don't know if Influenster was trolling me or what, but I left a scathing review for some other products I purchased from Beauty and Planet and they ended up sending me a complimentary bottle of this and the conditioner. So this shampoo does appear to be a little bit better than the other stuff I purchased (I think it was Rose?).. It smells really lovely and holy volume! This shampoo gave my hair GREAT body and volume which is awesome since my hair tends to be very straight and flat.. It lathers well, doesn't seem to leave any residue, and the scent is very soft.. If you like floral scents you will probably enjoy this.. Now as far as this being natural or green in any way, I would say it's definitely not; however, it does appear to work very well for what it's meant to do while smelling nice. If you're not concerned about green ingredients and want a shampoo that gives good body give this one a shot. I may even purchase another bottle of this stuff myself.. Thanks Influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
When will companies learn that sulfates are not good for our hair, especially curly hair. A reformulation is needed to remove sulfates and I would love to try this shampoo again.
--------------------
I love this brand and have many of their products so I wanted to try out the shampoo and conditioner for curly hair. Right away I felt my hair being smoother, softer and less frizz! But I immediately noticed many hair was falling out!! Usually when I would shower I’d get like 10 hair strands max that would fall from my head. Although with this shampoo and conditioner I was loosing triple that in only a week of using the products. My last shampoo and conditioner set was sulfate free and it could be that this shampoo and conditioner isn’t. So unfortunately I will not be using this product anymore. But will continue to use my other love beauty and planet products that work for me
--------------------
I tried Love Beauty & Planet Coconut Milk & White Jasmine Divine as I received a sample of it. It left a nice smell in my hair and treated it with care. I found that the colour and design of the package are very pretties and transmit a sensation of fresh as did the shampoo. Good design and good shampoo in my opinion. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
This scent is divine! Smells a lot like my Bond No 9 lotion. Like that my hair scent and body lotion scent aren’t competing. Leaves hair soft and tangle free. Love it!!!
--------------------
In short, I'd recommend the Love Beauty and Planet Coconut Milk & White Jasmine Shampoo . The texture isn't heavy and lathers enough without needing too much. If I really rub, I feel like I can get buildup about 90% out of my hair. If I am too heavy handed with the amount I use, it unfortunately emphasizes the parts of my hair that aren't soft. The fragrance is MUCH more subtle than most (such as bath and body works or not your mother's hair products) and I personally love jasmine. The major con is the packaging. You have to squeeze the bottle for the product to come out of the cap. The bottle is very round and its material isn't well suited for squeezing the product out. It's also tricky to control the amount that comes out because the cap opening is a little wide and you end up squeezing the bottle so hard. It's possible you will waste product and money from pouring too much out or from giving up when it starts to run low. For context, I have thin, fine, limp, mostly straight, damaged, and color treated hair. I'm also 3 months postpartum, use hair products about half the time, and wash my hair around twice a week.

--------------------
Great smelling shampoo. Very soothing scent and generally seemed like a higher end product. I enjoy buying items that are all the same scent so as not to have to work out blending scents. The shampoo, conditioner and hair spray were all coconut and jasmine scented. I also enjoyed that they all worked together to defrizz and give me defined curls.
--------------------
You can’t deny their care for animals definitely shines through their statement. I personally loved the rose scented shampoo and conditioner. Now if only they’d ditch the plastic. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
Love this line. The products are good for you and for the environment. Even their packaging (bottle) is made to be eco friendly by being 100% recyclable. Love that the ingredients are vegan and sourced responsibly.
--------------------
I love that this company only uses real ingredients and actually cares about the environment. Product works and smells great. I totally recommend this to all of my friends. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
Usually shampoo makes my hair feel really dry, before applying conditioner. Not this shampoo! Not only is the scent delightful, (most items with coconut, the coconut is overpowering. At least for me.) my hair felt so nice with only using the shampoo. My hair feels clean and hydrated! Would definitely recommend to everyone! And its affordable, what else could anyone want!?
--------------------
I received this product from ChickAdvisor for free. I really loved this shampoo. First, the smell was great without being overpowering and unnatural. Second, this shampoo left my hair feeling super clean. My hair felt soft after using this shampoo and I will definitely continue using it in the future! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
With fine hair I’m never sure what kind of shampoo to use. This brand has made it an easy choice for me! No matter which one I’m using, my hair comes out fantastic! Love the scent of white jasmine and how you get hints if it throughout the day (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
Is this product all natural? I doubt it. I still smelt chemicals. But does it work, yes. I feel that my hair was clean and there wasnt a build up from the shampoo. I might use this again (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I love this brand. Smells so good! Leaves hair feeling soft and manageable. I recommend to everyone. There's different ones so there's something for everyone. I like to keep extra at hand. It is affordable. Give it a try you will love it too
--------------------
At first I was hesitant to use this brand, but my curls needed love. This shampoo is free of all the harsh chemicals so it feels different when using it at first. The bottle is made of complete recyclable material. Great strong scent.
--------------------
I got this product for free from Chick Advisor to try it and gives my honest opinion , I like the Love beauty and planet hair care shampoo , It works well with my hair , It's 100 % contains the natural ingredients witch it keeps the hair healthy and safe , smells amazing scent , left my hair silky bright and not greasy , Even my daughter love it and use it , I recommend this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I love the smell of this shampoo. It leaves my hair feeling soft, shiny, and my curly waves are more manageable. I also love that it is plant based and ethically sourced, making it less harsh on our environment. Being free of harsh chemicals is a big plus. Even the bottles are made from recyclable materials that can be recycled as well. I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. #lovebeautyandplanetLove Beauty and Planet Coconut Milk & White Jasmine Shampoo [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Great shampoo, such good quality, smells soo good and really made a difference with my curly hair. Curl definition was a lot more noticeable, it detangles like a dream (use with the conditioner) and made my hair soooo soft I couldn't stop touching it. The only thing I'm not crazy about it the packaging, the bottles look like they're collapsing on themselves after just a couple uses. But the product is so good it still doesn't take away from it and i would definitely recommend it!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I received this product to try for free. I was very pleased with this shampoo!! I found it was very helpful in moisturizing my curls. The scent is just the cherry on top! I would buy this again for sure (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
What a delightful shampoo, not only is it vegan but it actually works. It has such wonderful lather unlike other vegan shampoos I have used in the past. I have long hair and it was like magic when I was working it through my lovely locks. The smell seemed strong when opening the bottle and I was concerned I would be knocking people out when I entered a room. This was not the case at all. I received compliments! The price is right as well and can be purchased in most stores. I would and have recommended to friends and family. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
I absolutely love this line of products! They smell so good and leave my hair feeling great. It doesnt dry out my hair but my hair stays clean longer. I can always smell the scent on my hair until I wash it next.
--------------------
I got this free sample from ChickAdvisor. I like the jasmine and coconut smell and it makes my hair smells good. Also it makes my hair feels clean and fresh after using it. I will buy this product again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
--------------------
The book is beautiful from front to back and is one of my favorites!
--------------------
Tastes like fruit punch to me. We mix these with water for our daughter so she can get some flavor in her drinks since we stay away from all those sugary juices.
--------------------
Works wonderfully and tastes great! Make sure to get it nice and cold for the best taste. Up & up provides a great price on this compared to the name brand price.
--------------------
Helped with my morning sickness and keep my self hydrated. Also, made them into popsicles which helped a lot.
--------------------
This is a high quality product to build back the electrolytes when the kids are sick. I always have a bottle on hand for cold and flu season to keep my kids hydrated. They enjoy the flavor so I have no trouble getting them to drink it.
--------------------
My kids did not like this as it was way too sweet for them. They don't normally drink juice or other sweet drinks, so this was overwhelming. I would recommend mixing with water to cut the sweetness. I really wish they sold this product in smaller bottles since you have to use it within 7 days of opening and we never go through that much during an illness.
--------------------
This is good to have and drink when you are dehydrated. Its a good option for when kids are sick and might be vomiting, or simply to replenish your body. The taste isn’t bad, and of course there’s different flavors. It’s a good balance of sweet with the salt. Price wise I think its a good deal for what you are getting.
--------------------
This product is very tasty, and good for children when they are dehydrated and can be picky on what they drink. I tasted this myself before giving it to my son and it tastes almost like juice. I like how Target has their own brand and you can easily buy it online or in the store. Highly recommend for young children who are sick!
--------------------
I got this just in time my daughter ended up sick and I needed to give her some fluids but she hates water and I didnt want to give her just surgery things so I gave her this she liked the flavor she hasnt liked others in the past due to flavor but she liked the flavor of tis brand. And it defanantly kept herhydrated while sick I definantly recomend this to others with little ones.
--------------------
I really, really love this stuff soo much! Its so nice to give my son when he doesn't want to drink water. Especially when he's sick, I love knowing he's getting the hydration he needs. Sometimes I even like to drink it when I work out. Really yummy!
--------------------
I've given this to my 9 year old son and he loves the taste. He said he hasn't tasted an electrolyte drink that tastes like this one before. It hydrates him very quickly after drinking it. The container is a good size so I dont have to run out quickly to get more. It is a Target brand which I trust a lot too and have never had any issues with.
--------------------
I get dehydrated easily and I drink this and water constantly. This stuff works great. In my opinion, the actual Pedialyte brand is too expensive. I've tried similar off-brand Pedialyte from other mass retailers and some are either too salty or too sweet but I think the Up & Up brand has the best balance. I wish there was more variety in the flavors but what they do have tastes great. Admittedly, this one is the weakest in terms of flavor but it's still tasty.
--------------------
could only give average review.Never tried this brand so not sure on anything.I put it in my cart to complete my $100 purchase with $25 gift card.Babies need at least 1 bottle.Price was good.
--------------------
I bought this for my husband and myself because we were concerned about hydration when suffering from Covid. Well the taste reminds me of salty Koolaid. That’s saying a lot for someone that lost their sense of taste. I’ll save the rest for my son.
--------------------
Works just as well as the name brand
--------------------
I buy this often for my grandkids. They love it!
--------------------
Awful taste. Last thing you want to drink when you feel sick. Was hoping it’d be better but I don’t blame my 3 yr old for refusing to drink it.
--------------------
Taste and price compared to name brand is amazing!
--------------------
Not the best , is sweeter than the pedialyte brand . It haves to be really cold in order for you to drink it cause at room temp is not so good .
--------------------
Bad ofter taste. I would rather get a different flavor or non generic brand and pay a bit more. Just don’t recommend this flavor
--------------------
I am always for generic brand items to save money. I bought this when my son had diarrhea and it helped keep him hydrated.
--------------------
Started my newborn on similac because of the hospital. Noticed she was very gassy. Constantly crying. Tried everything you could think of. Finally put her on the gerber soy and major difference in my baby. She is sleeping more. Not as gassy and overall happy baby!!! Definitely recommend
--------------------
Great product, just the flavor is not the best out of the line
--------------------
I had to water this bottle down anytime I poured a glass because if I hadn’t the taste was SO salty and in general has a weird flavor.
--------------------
I bought two bottles of this when I caught a stomach bug and I think it worked pretty well as I didn't seem to get dehydrated. I wouldn't ever drink it *unless* you're dehydrated though because of the sodium content (I don't know why you would but people are weird). I also thought the grape flavor was less likely to cause nausea as some of the other flavors I've had in the past.
--------------------
Best Pedialyte drink with the least amount of added dyes. Also a good taste that is not too strong!
--------------------
Good taste , I wish it did not had artificial, but it keeps me up when I’m sick .
--------------------
Great for adults and kids also great taste and affordable price
--------------------
Great taste for adults and affordable price
--------------------
I think this is one of the best flavors
--------------------
Best way to rehydrate.  Keep some on hand for emergencies
--------------------
Best flavor. This is our to go one whenever we don’t feel good or had some drinks the night before. Best is to drink it cold so we keep two inside the refrigerator just in case.
--------------------
Taste is awful, I always try stuff before giving it to my daughter.  This flavor tastes like cough syrup.
--------------------
I really love how well this worked to restore electrolytes and keep my son hydrated.
--------------------
This is a great product with amazing taste of berry flavors that helps you with dehydration.My husband is a truck driver and that pediolate helps him and gives more energy.We always have this product i the house juts in case if kids will get sick or even for hangover.Also i have leg cramps very often and since i started drinking that pediolate just one glass it really helped me and i am getting less and less leg cramps,great product for many uses.
--------------------
My daughter and myself have been drinking Pedialyte AdvancedCare Plus Electrolyte Solution here lately because our immune systems have been low and we've had colds and infections. Luckily this pedialyte has really helped us out. Its helped us stay hydrated when we didnt really want to drink or eat anything. It has a good berry taste so it wasn't hard to get my daughter to drink it. With the extra electrolytes, we've had that extra little boost of energy that helped us get by.
--------------------
Works great for my kids (and for hungover adults)! They also don’t mind the flavor so it’s not a fight to get them to drink it when they already feel under the weather.
--------------------
I decided to try this out for my children with the cold season approaching. Hydration is so important and Pedialyte has about 33% more electrolytes than others which is phenomenal. My son was the first in need of this and I tried it out as well to get a feel for the flavor. It’s a very well balanced berry flavor and extremely refreshing. The value is the greatest part as it is a one liter bottle at an impressive price. We have already ended up purchasing more of this Pedialyte Berry Frost for the season as the flavor is wonderful and the benefits are even better! I definitely recommend this if some electrolytes and extra hydration with great flavor is what you’re looking for. My son thought it was just a regular juice he loved the taste so much.
--------------------
Whenever my toddler or I get sick, I like to get an electrolyte solution to ensure we stay hydrated. This item is great for hydration. My three year old loves the flavor and I love that it works effectively. This item is great for adults and children.
--------------------
I got this recently and it has a good taste and helps with dehydration! Very good to have in the house .
--------------------
Seems to be great flavor daughter took it without fight.
--------------------
My kids can normally detect that I'm giving them pedialyte before they take a drink. This pedialyte was different. They loved this flavor. It really helped when they were sick to make them feel better.
--------------------
This is a very important item to have when a baby or young one is ill and unwilling to eat or drink. This helps ensure the LO stays hydrated. This brand has many other options to include popsicles or travel powders to mix up on the go. The taste of this is bland with slight salt water to it - which is how it is supposed to be unless you are expecting artificially sweetened to the max like gatorade. I would recommend it for parents of young ones who are ill and needing some help with hydration.
--------------------
Great tasting and effective. My child is super picky and actually enjoyed and like this. Packed with electrolytes.
--------------------
The flavor isn’t great for my little who is not typically exposed to juice but it’s not bad for what it is.
--------------------
This wasn’t the worst thing I’ve tasted, but it wasn’t the best either. The initial berry taste was actually pretty good, but there was a weird aftertaste in my mouth. It worked really well, and if I had to buy it again, I would, but if there were other flavors available, I might be inclined to try those first.
--------------------
Great flavor. No funky after taste. Good quality. Even makes good pops and ice cubes. Will be a staple in this house moving forward
--------------------
This Pedialyte tasted great! The size is perfect to keep on you in your work cooler. Perfect for sick people but also great for people that work in house conditions such as factory’s, warehouses, hot and draining environments. Would recommend to everyone!
--------------------
The Bsrry Ffost flavor is very nice. I like this drink for keeping hydrated, it's better than the sports versions. Keeps me hydrated while exercising. Would recommend!
--------------------
Love using this in place of sports drinks. Good for kids and adults.
--------------------
This product is great for a lot of reasons. I use this for the whole family, especially my significant other for when he's working long days. It really helps to keep healthy levels of fluids as well as potassium and sodium levels at a normal place, more so on days he works long hours and can't always hydrate. It has a great flavor too! He always says that he can't believe how good it tastes in comparison to the other flavors of this brand. The Advanced Care works a lot better than the other brands as well. My toddler really likes this flavor as well; I give to him when he has off days of not wanting to drink a lot of water, or we're having a busy on-the-go day just to make sure he doesn't miss out on anything that he needs. For my family, it has a variety of uses and I can think of a number of other situations where this drink would be very helpful in making one feel better. I really like what this product has to offer and I would certainly recommend.
--------------------
I was expecting so sort of berry taste mixed with the usual Pedialyte taste but it was thick and salty. It has a lot of benefits so I can ignore the taste and dilute It if necessary. It reminded me of the diabetes glucose drink test.
--------------------
Tastes great, kids and adults love it!
--------------------
I love this stuff, both of my kids really enjoy the taste and I know they are getting help when they’re feeling down. I know this is a trusted product to do the job. I received this items free in exchange for my opinion
--------------------
So thankfully none of my kids have been sick since I received this product to review, but I was able to personally use it for a hangover that had me feeling like death warmed over. The flavor is fine, and I was up off the couch by mid-morning (thanks, electrolytes!). I’ll keep a bottle of this around for the inevitable stomach bug that goes through our house once a year.
--------------------
I've yet to try it because I haven't needed it....yet! But I can say it's awesome that there's Pedialyte for adults! And it's still safe for kids to drink!
--------------------
I always keep pedialyte in the house during cold and flu season. It helps so much with dehydration. It definitely helps get your electrolytes back up. We used to buy sports drinks but pedialyte works so much better and the flavor is really good. I also love that's it's good for everyone in the family.
--------------------
This stuff tastes great! It’s got a berry flavor that isn’t too powerful and it’s not full of high fructose corn syrup or too much sugar. Helps my kids a lot with dehydration and when they are sick, it’s a good way to get their electrolytes back and keeps them hydrated. The flavor is yummy for kids and they think they are drinking koolaid.
--------------------
Such a cute solution to the mess we get in our kitchen every day from my sons high chair!! I love this. I just lay it under his high chair and after a meal fold it up, empty it in the trash and rinse it in the sink!! So much easier than sweeping and scrubbing the floors. I am also thinking this will be great when we go camping in a few weeks!
--------------------
Pedialyte has always been a staple in my baby essentials. It is great for keeping my children hydrated when they are a little dehydrated. I love this new flavor and so do my children.
--------------------
I recieved this item free in exchange for this review and just so happened to receive it the week a stomach bug was going around my home, between my toddler and infant they loved having this over sugary Gatorade.
--------------------
These work just as they should. Not painful when applying. Smooth.
--------------------
This drink is perfect if you’re recovering from being sick! I was extremely dehydrated from not being able to keep anything down for 4 days, but once I mixed this with some water, I was feeling better very quickly. Not to mention it tastes delicious.
--------------------
I bought it because I like the probiotic part and that it us made close to mothers milk. After breastfeed and switch completely to Gerber good start, baby is completely constipated. I wonder if it alters the internal culture if probiotics that came from previous breastmilk. We will wait on more week to see how it goes.
--------------------
I thought that maybe Soy would be perfect because a lot of the other brands made my baby gassy and constipated. Once I tried the Gerber Gentle. My baby is much happier and it agrees with his stomach.
--------------------
Love the good start gentle. My daughter does very well on this formula, no issues. Glad it's now non-gmo, even better! Wish there were coupons for it though!!
--------------------
Our pediatrician gave us a sample of this and it has been amazing! Our little guy had been constipated on the powder but as soon as he started using this he has been back to normal! Wish we could find it in stores [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Started using Gerber and label doesn't indicate whether or not product is GMO or not. Would be nice to know.

Best way to rehydrate.  Keep some on hand for emergencies
--------------------
Best flavor. This is our to go one whenever we don’t feel good or had some drinks the night before. Best is to drink it cold so we keep two inside the refrigerator just in case.
--------------------
Taste is awful, I always try stuff before giving it to my daughter.  This flavor tastes like cough syrup.
--------------------
I really love how well this worked to restore electrolytes and keep my son hydrated.
--------------------
This is a great product with amazing taste of berry flavors that helps you with dehydration.My husband is a truck driver and that pediolate helps him and gives more energy.We always have this product i the house juts in case if kids will get sick or even for hangover.Also i have leg cramps very often and since i started drinking that pediolate just one glass it really helped me and i am getting less and less leg cramps,great product for many uses.
--------------------
My daughter and myself have been drinking Pedialyte AdvancedCare Plus Electrolyte Solution here lately because our immune systems have been low and we've had colds and infections. Luckily this pedialyte has really helped us out. Its helped us stay hydrated when we didnt really want to drink or eat anything. It has a good berry taste so it wasn't hard to get my daughter to drink it. With the extra electrolytes, we've had that extra little boost of energy that helped us get by.
--------------------
Works great for my kids (and for hungover adults)! They also don’t mind the flavor so it’s not a fight to get them to drink it when they already feel under the weather.
--------------------
I decided to try this out for my children with the cold season approaching. Hydration is so important and Pedialyte has about 33% more electrolytes than others which is phenomenal. My son was the first in need of this and I tried it out as well to get a feel for the flavor. It’s a very well balanced berry flavor and extremely refreshing. The value is the greatest part as it is a one liter bottle at an impressive price. We have already ended up purchasing more of this Pedialyte Berry Frost for the season as the flavor is wonderful and the benefits are even better! I definitely recommend this if some electrolytes and extra hydration with great flavor is what you’re looking for. My son thought it was just a regular juice he loved the taste so much.
--------------------
Whenever my toddler or I get sick, I like to get an electrolyte solution to ensure we stay hydrated. This item is great for hydration. My three year old loves the flavor and I love that it works effectively. This item is great for adults and children.
--------------------
I got this recently and it has a good taste and helps with dehydration! Very good to have in the house .
--------------------
Seems to be great flavor daughter took it without fight.
--------------------
My kids can normally detect that I'm giving them pedialyte before they take a drink. This pedialyte was different. They loved this flavor. It really helped when they were sick to make them feel better.
--------------------
This is a very important item to have when a baby or young one is ill and unwilling to eat or drink. This helps ensure the LO stays hydrated. This brand has many other options to include popsicles or travel powders to mix up on the go. The taste of this is bland with slight salt water to it - which is how it is supposed to be unless you are expecting artificially sweetened to the max like gatorade. I would recommend it for parents of young ones who are ill and needing some help with hydration.
--------------------
Great tasting and effective. My child is super picky and actually enjoyed and like this. Packed with electrolytes.
--------------------
The flavor isn’t great for my little who is not typically exposed to juice but it’s not bad for what it is.
--------------------
This wasn’t the worst thing I’ve tasted, but it wasn’t the best either. The initial berry taste was actually pretty good, but there was a weird aftertaste in my mouth. It worked really well, and if I had to buy it again, I would, but if there were other flavors available, I might be inclined to try those first.
--------------------
Great flavor. No funky after taste. Good quality. Even makes good pops and ice cubes. Will be a staple in this house moving forward
--------------------
This Pedialyte tasted great! The size is perfect to keep on you in your work cooler. Perfect for sick people but also great for people that work in house conditions such as factory’s, warehouses, hot and draining environments. Would recommend to everyone!
--------------------
The Bsrry Ffost flavor is very nice. I like this drink for keeping hydrated, it's better than the sports versions. Keeps me hydrated while exercising. Would recommend!
--------------------
Love using this in place of sports drinks. Good for kids and adults.
--------------------
This product is great for a lot of reasons. I use this for the whole family, especially my significant other for when he's working long days. It really helps to keep healthy levels of fluids as well as potassium and sodium levels at a normal place, more so on days he works long hours and can't always hydrate. It has a great flavor too! He always says that he can't believe how good it tastes in comparison to the other flavors of this brand. The Advanced Care works a lot better than the other brands as well. My toddler really likes this flavor as well; I give to him when he has off days of not wanting to drink a lot of water, or we're having a busy on-the-go day just to make sure he doesn't miss out on anything that he needs. For my family, it has a variety of uses and I can think of a number of other situations where this drink would be very helpful in making one feel better. I really like what this product has to offer and I would certainly recommend.
--------------------
I was expecting so sort of berry taste mixed with the usual Pedialyte taste but it was thick and salty. It has a lot of benefits so I can ignore the taste and dilute It if necessary. It reminded me of the diabetes glucose drink test.
--------------------
Tastes great, kids and adults love it!
--------------------
I love this stuff, both of my kids really enjoy the taste and I know they are getting help when they’re feeling down. I know this is a trusted product to do the job. I received this items free in exchange for my opinion
--------------------
So thankfully none of my kids have been sick since I received this product to review, but I was able to personally use it for a hangover that had me feeling like death warmed over. The flavor is fine, and I was up off the couch by mid-morning (thanks, electrolytes!). I’ll keep a bottle of this around for the inevitable stomach bug that goes through our house once a year.
--------------------
I've yet to try it because I haven't needed it....yet! But I can say it's awesome that there's Pedialyte for adults! And it's still safe for kids to drink!
--------------------
I always keep pedialyte in the house during cold and flu season. It helps so much with dehydration. It definitely helps get your electrolytes back up. We used to buy sports drinks but pedialyte works so much better and the flavor is really good. I also love that's it's good for everyone in the family.
--------------------
This stuff tastes great! It’s got a berry flavor that isn’t too powerful and it’s not full of high fructose corn syrup or too much sugar. Helps my kids a lot with dehydration and when they are sick, it’s a good way to get their electrolytes back and keeps them hydrated. The flavor is yummy for kids and they think they are drinking koolaid.
--------------------
Such a cute solution to the mess we get in our kitchen every day from my sons high chair!! I love this. I just lay it under his high chair and after a meal fold it up, empty it in the trash and rinse it in the sink!! So much easier than sweeping and scrubbing the floors. I am also thinking this will be great when we go camping in a few weeks!
--------------------
Pedialyte has always been a staple in my baby essentials. It is great for keeping my children hydrated when they are a little dehydrated. I love this new flavor and so do my children.
--------------------
I recieved this item free in exchange for this review and just so happened to receive it the week a stomach bug was going around my home, between my toddler and infant they loved having this over sugary Gatorade.
--------------------
These work just as they should. Not painful when applying. Smooth.
--------------------
This drink is perfect if you’re recovering from being sick! I was extremely dehydrated from not being able to keep anything down for 4 days, but once I mixed this with some water, I was feeling better very quickly. Not to mention it tastes delicious.
--------------------
Similac advance is a great formula in my opinion. My baby has never had any trouble keeping it down. And I feel like it’s a good formula to try if you want to transition you’re baby. But all babies are different and might need a different formula.
--------------------
Great formula. Tried different formulas in the beginning and my baby could not tolerate the competitors formula. This has been the best choIce from the beginning.
--------------------
First time using this product and he loves it.
--------------------
My baby never get tired of getting Similac from birth and still going strong
--------------------
He loves this formula has had no issues with it just loves it
--------------------
Absolutely love this formula and so does my little princess
--------------------
My son loves this stuff!! I have 0 complaints!
--------------------
This us great formy baby girl, but every child is different!
--------------------
I had a baby who didn’t have much colic or gas he did absolutely amazing with this formula !!!! He is now 7 months and still on this formula with no issues. I am also pregnant and will be using this formula for my newborn and the best part is if she’s sensitive they have formula for sensitive baby’s too. I felt bad about not breastfeeding until I came across similac it provides all the nutrients your baby needs to grow healthy and strong don’t feel bad go similac . SIMILAC IS THE WAY TO GO !
--------------------
I have 3 kids I used similac advance with and currently using it with my third. They all have been happy on it with no disgestive problems. And it’s convenient to have it in powder, ready to feed and singles packets and the ready made made mini bottles, to suit whatever situation you might need it in. I would definitely recommend similac.
--------------------
We used the pre mixed formula for our baby and every single time it caused him extreme amount of gas. He was so uncomfortable that we had to throw the rest of the bottles out. This formula has caused us so much fussiness and lost sleep. I do not recommend this product to anyone.
--------------------
My baby loved this formula Such a wonderful formula
--------------------
Used with my daughter and now with my son! No issues. Very satisfied!
--------------------
I hadn?t tried this product before I was sent a free sample box. After, I used it for the first time my baby and I fell in love! It helped relieve his gas and generally enjoyed it. I can?t breastfeed all the time so to be able to make a bottle using this great formula is so convenient and amazing for the baby! I was afraid to use formula thinking it wouldn?t be as affective as breast milk but Similac proved me wrong! I will continue buying formula because I was so pleased! Thank you!
--------------------
I absolutely love this formula it has helped so much and I really love the ready made formula as well.
--------------------
We've tried Similac with out daughter on multiple occasions, created the formula exactly as directed, fed and burped her, and each time about an hour or two after feeding she would start screaming like she was in serious pain, and we couldn't get her to stop until we switched to a different brand of formula all together. 10 out of 10 times would recommend something else.
--------------------
Works perfect to help supplement feed our daughter, shes putting on and maintaining a healthy weight. Never have had a problem with it :)
--------------------
Use similac advance and makes my daughter really funny. Have tried other formulas and she is still pretty much the same way on all
--------------------
I love Similac! I will never use any other formula
--------------------
Great. Baby boys putting on weight like a champ.
--------------------
All three of my kids have been on similac and ONLY similac I would probably recommend pro total comfort, sensitive, and advance due to my three kids taking all of them. My daughter was the only one who could take similac advance, my second son couldn’t due to him throwing it up and always being constipated so they switched him to pro total comfort and it improved but not fully so sensitive was next and he did AMAZING! With that one, my third son who was born in Dec. 2019 started on similac advance and didn’t take it well either, same problem as my second son, so of course they switched him to pro total comfort and again it worked AMAZING with him. I don’t think I’ll ever use another brand other than similac, I always recommend it to my friends, and close family members. Because even if once can doesn’t work with baby there’s one out there that they have that will.
--------------------
My granddaughter had to switch to Similac Pro-total comfort because she had too much gas. We stayed with the Similac family!
--------------------
We use advance to supplement breastmilk and it's been very well tolerated by our girl.
--------------------
Only formula both my son and daughter could keep down!
--------------------
I love Similac there are so many choices they will always have what u need
--------------------
We used similac advance when we first came home from the hospital after having my son, little did we know that he was lactose intolerant and couldn’t have it, but as a mom and a nanny I’ve used this formula many times before. I would recommend it
--------------------
My 2 month old has been on Advance, Sensitive and now Total Comfort - he has been constipated since birth, with the Similac products. Pediatrician gave samples of a different brand, which worked WONDERS; however we are on WIC and unfortunately they do not offer a different brand of formula.
--------------------
Shes the happiest baby since she has been on the advance
--------------------
I used Similac Pro Advance with all 3 of my kids. They had no fussiness after feeding. I recommend this product to all new moms.
--------------------
I give my 2.5 month old daughter breast milk and Similac. Due to me not producing a lot of breast milk I give her formula and she has no problem with it. Her dad doesn't want her on formula, but she gets it.
--------------------
Similac Advanced i used since last 3.5 month but last it was bad experience. Powder smell to horrible & color was change.its expiry dt has 2020. I know it's normal for the powder to smell/look different from the liquid readymade...but this is just icky to me!! Its very bad experience i never suggest anyone to buy similac advance.
--------------------
My baby loves it. He gets a little gassy but nothing to worry about to much
--------------------
I tried almost all the similar formulas for my now 3 month old and I found this to be the best one. No colics no spitting out! I recommend this one for sure!
--------------------
The hospital started us out with Similac advanced, but then we started to notice the stool count shorten. Similac Advanced caused my baby to have extremely bad constipation to where now I have been switched from Advanced to Sensitive to now Total-Comfort and my baby hasn’t had a stool in 4 days. If it wasn’t because of WIC only covering Similac, I would look for something else that fits my child and what he needs.
--------------------
We used Similac for our kids and we are thankful they grew healthy, smart and strong. I definitively trust and recommend the great products from Similac.
--------------------
I breastfed my baby his first month then switched him to this and he loves it, but it makes him extremely gassy and constipated. It also clumps at times along the side of the bottle and really doesn’t have a pleasant smell. I have 12 cans of it so now I have to figure out which other product to switch to.
--------------------
Good for baby’s for brain and bons
--------------------
This products is great for my baby.
--------------------
This product is the only thing my baby has been able to keep down and not have tummy aches with. Such a life saver, definitely going to keep buying this product and recommend to other moms/ moms to be!
--------------------
I breastfeed and I was giving this formula by a fellow mother, I been supplementing with this and my baby seems to love it (I brought again since).The only thing I'm not too thrilled with is the smell and sometimes clumps of the powder do not fully dissolve. This is the only reason why I'm not giving it a full 5 star review
--------------------
This was given at the hospital. We switched to a couple other kinds, but had to go back to this one. Never had any problems with this formula at all.
--------------------
I know a lot of mothers who use this for their Children unfortunately my little one didnt do too well with this one. She does great with Pro Advance. Not too sure why WIC doesnt approve Pro Advance. They say it's pretty much the same but its has HMO and NON GMO. Anyway, I'm sure Advance is great.
--------------------
My son liked the formula but is sensitive to protein in dairy so we put him on the Alimentum/Elecare we rotate. And I just have to thank you guys for making these products edible because we were first given the Nutramigen and the baby HATED IT!! Even the ready to feed so we thank you for the great products!!!
--------------------
Used with both kids great product
--------------------
Baby girl loved the taste but unfortunately she has a milk protein allergy so we are now on alimentum.
--------------------
Always have started out using it,but both my babies ended up with the total comfort.
--------------------
This brand of formula has been great to my baby.
--------------------
Really Great product! Love it.
--------------------
Highly recommend this product great prices and excellent nutrition!
--------------------
Excellent product been using it ever since my baby was born and i dnt have any complaints about it.
--------------------
Love it its grest and reasonable priced i use powder seem to last a wee bit longer
--------------------
Love the larger cans! My LO is 3M but weighs 18lbs so we go through cans about every 4 days, the bigger one is more bang for your buck!
--------------------
Large can size is a must. We are on a high calorie diet so we use more formula to water. The large can gets us almost a week!!!
--------------------
My 5 month old loves this milk, was on a different brand and he hated it. So happy for similac products.
--------------------
Best formula on the market! Have used for all of my children and never had any issues.
--------------------
Daughter did so great on this! So much so, we went to pro advance with the probiotic as well!
--------------------
My 3 year old used this and it was wonderful. My youngest son has to be on the similac alimentum.
--------------------
Only thing my son’s lil tummy could handle besides breast milk! So thankful the pediatrician recommended it to try! When on a different formula, he was miserable! Happy boy now using this!!
--------------------
Great product, I’ve been using Similac to all 3 of my kids. I would recommend to all the parents out there. Try to used.
--------------------
This formula is the only on my son will take. We supplement so he doesn't get very much. Everything else hurts his tummy or stops him up. It's also one of the only formulas without palm oil, which is great.
--------------------
My son has been on this since he was born and I love it!
--------------------
Great product. Haven't had any issues. Have tried regular advance and pro advance. Both great
--------------------
Our family loves this product. Great size choices for different canisters.
--------------------
Ive never used just the advanced. We use the pro advanced (silver) My son is 4.5 months and has never had a problem with it. Even switching from breast milk, to formula. It mixes well with his cereal, and mixes well period. Only con is price. But other then that it leaves my baby happy and full.
--------------------
My granddaughter was a premiere and was put on Similac Neo Sure in the hospital. She is now doing great so we changed her formula to Similac Advance but it gave her an upset stomach and has pains not to mention she started throwing up every time we fed it to her. Sometime is would be 15 minutes other times it could be an hour later. So we had to go back to her original formula and she is doing great but now just need to get rid of the gas pains.
--------------------
My baby loves this product.he just can't get enough
--------------------
When my daughter was born she was using good start formula and she couldn’t keep it down so I switched to Similac and she’s been keeping it down since
--------------------
This is great for those times you can't breast feed.
--------------------
My son had a hard to passing gas with the other name formula and we decided to switch. We notice the difference right away. Wonderful product and we still continue to use it.
--------------------
Used this formula for my first born absolutely loved it on lo number 2 and hes using the similac sensitve and its just as good :)
--------------------
This is the only formula I use with all three of my children. Very reliable and great nutrition for the growing baby. This formula has never disagreed with my kids immature GI system!
--------------------
love the formula. best one we have tried
--------------------
Love this for my baby no problems at all
--------------------
Awesome my baby's has been on this formula since she was 4 weeks and she loves it
--------------------
I was unable to successfully breastfeed so I turned to Similac. My son is pleasantly plump and well-fed. I love that Similac has the same consistency as milk.
--------------------
My daughter could not tolerate formula until we switched to this brand. I am more than satisfied
--------------------
May baby loves this formula I had tried others and still I came back to this
--------------------
My infant daughter has been drinking the Optigro since birth. She is keeping up on the charts and seems to like it just fine.
--------------------
Similac is the best formula for both my boys
--------------------
Used 3 different brand but baby kept having constipation issues. Switched to Similac pro Advance, her pediatrician recommended to her and problem solve.
--------------------
We were using this formula to supplement my breast milk and it was working very well for me and my baby.
--------------------
My daughter started out with another brand. The pediatrician switched her to this. No more constipation!
--------------------
Used another brand but baby had constipation issues. Switched to Similac Advance per pediatrician recommendation. Immediate improvement.
--------------------
We started using it from the very beginning because that's what the hospital recommended and have been so happy. Baby loves it. No digestion issues. No gas. No problems going from breastmilk to formula and back and forth either. Wouldn't use anything else!
--------------------
This is the best product to is for babies. It taste good and the baby loves it. It is always a pleasure to buy such a great product and we won't change it at all.
--------------------
My daughter was started on this formula in the hospital and has done extremely well on it
--------------------
This is great! My baby loves it!
--------------------
My daughter is 2 months about to be 3. She would cry alot and wake up a lot but with this product no more. she took it very well.
--------------------
My son had colon atresia and immediately had surgery after birth due to being unable to poop. After switching from breast milk to formula, this is the only formula that is easy for him to digest, no problems with gas or throwing up or spit up, AND I love the fact that when you mix it, it isn’t foamy as compared to enfamil or any other formula. The taste is sweet, has more calcium than enfamil, and better vitamins. My son is so strong and advanced for his age, I absolutely love similac and will recommend to any moms!!!!
--------------------
I’ve had no problems with the advance no switched to it after I ran out of pro advance samples from the doctor and she had no problem switching. She poops fine. Only thing is she goes they it like crazy. She’s only 4 months and eats 8 or every 4 hours it’s insane.
--------------------
My baby normally uses pro advance, but the store ran out and only had this product. Unlike other products, he liked this one. He was either really hungry or loved it, he was done with his bottle in less than 10minutes and he usually takes longer to eat.
--------------------
While my baby uses the Pro Advance formula typically, it’s not always available in stores near my mother in law. In emergencies when I’m without formula (such as in a recent event where I completely forgot his diaper bag! #newmomfail) her local store does carry the Similac Advanced. Once when he was only a few weeks old the sudden change in formula types gave him a slight rash, but now he can switch between the two without issue. Heck, the rash may not have been caused by the formula at all but perhaps what he was wearing or any other myriad of things newborns come in contact with. The rash was gone in less than 4 hours and gave Mom and Dad more worry than it did baby. Regardless!! This product is great. Just as all Similac products are.
--------------------
I love that both my babies were able to drink this formula just fine with no problems!
--------------------
I was feeding my baby this formula since he was born but he would always cry with it and i would have to forse him to drink it lately. till the day i saw it had black particles in it i immediately called the pediatrician she said to take him in Asap! As soon as i arrived she checked him and sent him to the hospital he had lots of tests done turned out those metal like particles were messing with his stomach i spent a bunch of money on the formula just to be told to get rid of it because it was contaminated. My baby got changed to similac sensitive now hes doing great. im checking his formula very closely. Btw i tasted it its sweet i liked it lol i recommend it for sure my baby poops within 3 days which is great to me no more belly aches.
--------------------
Perfect for my twin boys!! Easy to digest also.
--------------------
I love how easy this formula was for both of my children to digest! We've had no issues and love the affordability as well as the size of the containers.
--------------------
I am happy with Similac. After trying and trying to breastfeed at 100% my now 3 months old without succes I have found Similac to be great for her. Thank you.
--------------------
Started using this formula two days ago and my baby likes it but only issue Im having is that my newborn hasnt pooped in almost two days. I dont know if this is normal or not any suggestions? Thank you.
--------------------
My granddaughter was having issues spitting up with her other formula. We decided to try Similac advanced and it’s been great. She hasn’t spit up once with it.
--------------------
I love similac its the only formula I seem to be able to use for my daughter she doesn't do so good with the total comfort formula but she does fine with the other three or four formulas I have tired
--------------------
