Flavor = amazing. The only problem is the noodles really stick together. I have to let mine sit for 10 mins and then stir for about 2 mins to get them to separate.
--------------------
I can't get enough of this ramen! This is above and beyond what I thought instant ramen could be. It's super flavorful, with amazing broth and tasty noodles.
--------------------
So yummy. Soothing Miso and tasty ramen.
--------------------
Had to write another review for my second favorite flavor! Really love this one because the miso taste is incredible and rich. You know how sometimes when you order miso soup and it tastes watery? This is not at all that. Amazing flavor that keeps me full. Not to mention the noodles are insanely good!!
--------------------
This ramen is amazing. It's really hard to find a great vegan and vegetarian ramen but this is so awesome. The broth is absolutely delicious and decadent, but not too salty.I like that the noodles are steamed, not fried too. This tastes like a restaurant-quality bowl of ramen.
--------------------
This ramen is life changing. I never knew that instant ramen could be this delicious. The broth is out of this world, and the noodles are perfect.
--------------------
Love the broth. Can’t get enough. Perfect snack. Satisfies my cravings.
--------------------
This ramen is amazing. I love how rich the broth is - it truly tastes like the ramen broth that I get at my local restaurant. That's how good it is. What's cool about this ramen is that it has a lot less salt than most ramen brands. I like that the noodles are steamed, not fried too.
--------------------
I’m always on the hunt for a ramen without fish products, and Mike’s ramen is excellent for my fish-allergic ramen fan. I feel like the noodles could soak a bit longer, but the flavor of the ramen is terrific. More are already in my cart for my next Target run!
--------------------
I shouldn’t have listened to reviews... :( often target has promotional type of reviews and I have a feeling that’s what all the positive ones were. I couldn’t even Eat this and will return the rest! It’s $2 a piece and I had to flush this down the toilet! I had to let it sit and microwave 3x to get the noodles to soften. They taste like their made from mung beans. The broth does not Tate’s like chicken I even tried to add some salt which didn’t help at all! Not sure what the oil is supposed to do. It just made its super hot so be careful you don’t burn you tongue! Honestly I don’t think I’ve had anything so bad since those Kodiak flapjack cup things also inedible yet tons of good reviews.. Maybe I’ll just stay away from all food in cups.. lol
--------------------
I think the wrong picture is posted on this item - this is the chicken ramen, not the beef. Regardless, it’s the best dry/cup style ramen on the market - clean ingredients and rich restaurant style broth. It’s actually better than some restaurant broth I’ve had. Totally worth it.
--------------------
Flavor = amazing. The only problem is the noodles really stick together. I have to let mine sit for 10 mins and then stir for about 2 mins to get them to separate.
--------------------
I can't say enough how much I love this ramen! It is just as good, maybe better, than what's at my favorite restaurant. I love the rich broth and the perfectly chewy noodles. Their website also has great recipes to customize with your favorite toppings - yum!
--------------------
My favorite comfort food. Can’t get enough of this. Best ramen ever.
--------------------
This ramen is life-changing! It's that good. The broth is super insanely good and literally tastes like something out of a restaurant, but get this... the ramen is WAY less salty than most brands and the noodles are steamed, not fried too. This has changed instant ramen for me forever.
--------------------
Finally! I'm student and work too so I am always on the go. This ramen has been a GAME CHANGER for me. I am always craving savory food and ramen and this doesn't make me feel guilty while eating it. Buying so many!!!
--------------------
not good. noodles are spaghetti noodles. flavor is gross. don't waste your money
--------------------
This ramen has transformed the way I think about instant ramen. This is a far cry from my college ramen days. Mike's Mighty Good rivals even the best ramen I've had in Japan. All of the flavors are delicious, but the spicy chicken is my favorite. Try it for yourself!
--------------------
Decadent. Spice so good. The broth is rich.
--------------------
This ramen is amazing. The broth is super insanely good and not too salty. I like spicy foods, so this flavor is amazing. I like that the noodles are steamed, not fried too. This tastes like a restaurant
--------------------
They are not bad. First time trying them. I love spicy food but this is not too spicy the lime kind of cuts it. You can taste the lime on the noodles not on the soup water. Not too salty. Overall good for the price.
--------------------
Drove pretty far for these because they weren't available at any of the nearby targets. Totally worth the drive though because, they taste so good. They are spicy but not too spicy where like your nose is running and you have to get gulp down a jug of water every minute. It just the perfect amount of Chili flavor. Swear Maruchan feed me through hard times. College Life. I bought 8 for $2 and some change.
--------------------
This is a pantry staple, especially for those with tight budgets. I do not like the extremely high sodium content so I usually dump some of the flavor seasoning in the garbage before adding water.
--------------------
I really like This product it is very good And inexpensive often times you can add vegetables or an egg
--------------------
do I even have to right this, it's ramen it's delicious
--------------------
I love ramen soup, and I don’t know if the issue was with the soup itself or the packaging.  It smelled so bad!  Like rubber from a tire.
--------------------
I love these these are so good
--------------------
Excellent soup!!! Fills you up without stuffing you.
--------------------
Very great price. Arrived within a couple of days within the USA. Very delicious and stir fried with organic carrots and asparagus was very tasty. Will try with other ingredients of meat next time and great with spices added of your choice from your pantry. Packaging was great and arrived safely. Well done Target! Will be a repeat customer! Thank you!
--------------------
Good for When eating on a budget. *Try not to microwave.
--------------------
they do have a lot of sodium but people sure like them and they are a cheap lunch if you have to grab something sometime..... quick .
--------------------
no taste, only salt in lieu of any flavor
--------------------
great for eating a fast meal for all ages. this would also be a perfect meal if your power went out. you could heat water over a fire in your yard and it would only take about 4 min for the water to cook your noodles .my kids and i love this product . its not to salty like most Ramon noodles
--------------------
Nothing good pr special, but cheap and filling
--------------------
More expensive than packages but helps with portion control.
--------------------
People ask me how I survive my week. I point them to this holiness of a ramen, serves me for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Makes well for a midnight snack too
--------------------
Easy snack, I’ve tried most flavors love them all.
--------------------
My children love it!
--------------------
Ramen's are great. I usually never make the soup, but put it in a cup of hot water and let it sit with the flavor packet while I do a pan of stir fry veggies. Then I add the noodles to finish it off. Sometimes, I add a little sauce or honey. Sometimes not. But always delicious!
--------------------
When budget needs must be met. Noodles is the way to go.
--------------------
I prefer Maruchan brand over others. I usually eat it as a soup. I add frozen mixed vegetables for a fast, easy delicious soup. I don't buy the ones with styrofoam cup. Came well packed.
--------------------
so good for holiday meals i love it

--------------------
Cheap and quick! Easy for teens
--------------------
I ordered ramen and I got ramen! Woohoo!
--------------------
So easy to make and tastes good too
--------------------
I love the soup, the price and the Flavor is really good
--------------------
Much better than the other brands
--------------------
Delicious quick meal!
--------------------
got this for my son he love it.
--------------------
Seeing how noodles has gone up in value over the years, these are still very tasty and enjoy making noodles stir fry. Great with mixed veggies stir fry as well as meat and on its own. Great taste!
--------------------
I bought this for fun because I saw it online. I didn't think I could get it but when it came in the mail I was so happy. I love these so much I would recommend this for anyone in collage or just some one who doesn't want to go to the store. Great product!
--------------------
bought this on sale and thought 'WHY NOT?' it's always good to have ramen in the house. I boil as directed and quickly saute them in wither sesame oil or oyster sauce, with some veggies, and i have a quick-pin-free yakisoba for the kids.
--------------------
Good taste and quick
--------------------
My favorite soup!! Sad they don’t have them in stock in stores :/
--------------------
Delicious, hot & spicy
--------------------
My son really likes the chili mixed with the chicken flavor, for a quick meal.
--------------------
Quick and easy meal to make and tastes good.
--------------------
Despite the fact that this product is listed as "great for a vegetarian diet", it is not vegetarian. I read the ingredients when I got it in the mail and it lists both "beef fat" and "beef extract" under the Soup Base Ingredients. Obviously these are not vegetarian ingredients, so I cannot eat the ramen. I was really excited about finding a cheap vegetarian ramen, so this was very disappointing. However if you aren't a vegetarian, or aren't planning on using the flavor packet, then this product would work just fine. I'm sure the ramen tastes great, but it should not be advertised as vegetarian.
--------------------
Came perfectly fine. Within shipping time very early. No all Day waiting.
--------------------
The shrimp ramen tasted pretty good. I still prefer the chicken flavor the best.
--------------------
Purchased for my mom, she likes the shrimp flavor so I knew the lime chili would be a hit. I was right she loved it.
--------------------
By far the best Ramen noodle flavor! So happy that target carries it because it is hard to find.
--------------------
My FAVORITE noodle: combined a refreshing lime flavor and a slightly spicy taste. Kinda like Thai tom yum. I like this noodle so much I could eat it every day.
--------------------
These are my favorite maruchan noodles ever. I buy like whole boxes of these once every couple months because I never want to run out lol. Don’t listen to anyone else I’ll defend these noodles till the day I die.
--------------------
the "lime" is very artificial tasting- ate a few bites and tossed it
--------------------
This is great 14 we usually eat pretty healthy but when I am at work and the kiddo has to heat something up for himself this is the go to. ￼
--------------------
quick and easy meal that is great tasting!
--------------------
The cheapy satisfying meal
--------------------
Item just as shown. Great service from Target. We love Maruchan Beef Ramen Noodle Soup!!
--------------------
it was surprisingly good
--------------------
It’s OK but nothing special. It’s no better than Maruchan or Nissin, but those brands are much less costly.
--------------------
Love that target.com is now carrying this!!! Hands down the best neutral ramen that you can easily build up with new flavors, veggies, meats, etc. I love it plain with some green onions on top but you do you boo.
--------------------
I like the Japanese Noodles!
--------------------
These noodles were better than I expected. My kids love them. I plan to order more.
--------------------
Delivered in a few days. Great value
--------------------
Found out the seasoning contains animal products AFTER purchasing!!  Tossed the packets and kept the noodles to use for my VEGETARIAN  meals.  Noodles are large and flavorful, so if you just are needing Asian noodles for any meal or soup, these will work fine.
--------------------
This is the true Ramen from Japan
--------------------
Please update label information.  I read the ingredient list and did not see any meat products.  There is chicken and beef in the seasoning so therefore I will not be eating it as I am a vegetarian.
--------------------
If you read the label info listed on here, it does not show any animal products, indicating it being vegetarian.  Upon receiving the product, the actual ingredients include chicken and beef.
--------------------
Good noodles. Not spicy.
--------------------
Very good but needs some extra water or it is very salty. You get your money's worth for the amount! Great snack.
--------------------
in this hard time in 2020 during the outbreak, not thing is better that be able to get food. Honestly this ramen is the least one i would get when is regular time but now. Nothing is left so only this flavor has left over. The pack is 5pk for $5.99 is kindda pricey. The list said original flavor soup is lie! only a pack of MSG come with the noodle. I have to put an extra beef broad anyway plus lime juice to make this instant noodle taste good.
--------------------
This instant ramen is very tasty.
--------------------
Good ramen. Personally I like soy source & miso flavor better, but they are still good. My daughter likes this particular flavor.
--------------------
This is basically chicken flavored ramen.  Not to my taste as it is very bland besides tasting heavily of chicken flavor.  I would give it 3 1/2 stars, but mostly just personal preference.  I think the miso one has much more flavor.
--------------------
Delicious. Much better than the cheap alternatives
--------------------
I'm not sure if the recipe has been changed, but it tastes a bit saltier than what I remember...
--------------------
Better than top ramen ! Flavor is wonderful and the noodles cook perfectly
--------------------
Nice taste it’s my new favorite! Love that it has two packs of sauce which adds to the overall flavor.
--------------------
For ramen noodles,  these are very good.   I'll be ordering again soon
--------------------
These noodles are plentiful noodles and also heartier than regular ramen.  As much as I love miso, I did not care for the flavor of this, and added my Thai Peanut Sauce to make it a lot more flavorful.  My advice is to NOT over cook the noodles, as then they become mushy; and if you are like me and find you do not care for the flavor, just add any of your favorite stir fry sauces to jazz it up.  Also this is one that can hold a lot of different add ins, such as sauteed mushrooms, broccoli, shrimp, etc. to make it a complete dish.
--------------------
This ramen is so yummy!! I love that it's plant based/vegan. The noodles cook perfectly and the flavor is very tasty.
--------------------
Love the shrimp ramen not only because it is so easy to prepare and better tasting to me than any other kind, but there is NO styrafoam cup to go into the landfill!!. Ramen noodles cooked, 
 also make it easy to create stir fried chow mien, or lo mien with other veggies and/or shrimp!( I add a little soy sauce and sesame oil.) Also, make more of a meal accompanied with egg rolls. Your guests will never know it is just ramen!!  Great way to stretch the budget without sacrificing taste!!
--------------------
Doesn't taste like shrimp, but who cares! It's ramen!
--------------------
I don’t normally live miso, but I feel like this might be closer to miso you’d get at a ramen restaurant. It’s definitely still instant ramen, but it’s also definitely 10x better than the regular instant ramen. I tend to throw some crispy tofu in and call it dinner
--------------------
They're not bad, but the normal soy sauce ramen tastes better.
--------------------
This has been a quarantine treat! It’s definitely more dressed up than the regular instant ramen. I’ve been adding in bok choy, nori, tofu or pork, and a ramen egg or two and it’s almost like going to a restaurant.
--------------------
A good cheap alternative to going out for ramen. Just add in a boiled egg, some sprouts, greens, meat of your choice, etc and you are all set
--------------------
I love this one. It's my absolute favourite of the flavours, but all of my friends hate it. If you're interested in it, don't buy a lot of them.
--------------------
These were really good, good amount of lime (was surprised by this)!
--------------------
i love this flavor! I normally add extra lime and some hot sauce
--------------------
solid ramen choice. not to hot/spicy but good flavor kick
--------------------
This is my go-to instant ramen.
--------------------
This ramen is spicy but yummy. It is perfect to take when busy
--------------------
For my family this is a must have at home. However I wish they would allow you to buy 12 to get the case instead of 10 and receive a box with 2 missing soups.
--------------------
Nice quick meal to have on hand.
--------------------
Need to bring them back in stock at Gainesville, VA. Love them!
--------------------
Best noodles ever! :)
--------------------
More expensive but portioned control alternative to ramen noodles
--------------------
