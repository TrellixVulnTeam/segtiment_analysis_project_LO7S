it's cheese it's edible it's good
--------------------
Great Cheese. Good price.
--------------------
Good cheese, good price. Per ounce it’s even cheaper than Costco price for their store brand. It is always stocked in our refrigerator.
--------------------
Listen, I like This cheese. It goes amazingly on top of burgers. Makes the most delicious crunchy cheese skirts. And Limmie tell you... made a mighty fine homemade brown pita pizza. Yum!!! So, for me it’s two thumbs up!!!
--------------------
These are a great price point for what you get. I do wish they sold larger bags because we go through a lot of cheese at our house.
--------------------
Good cheese and a good price
--------------------
Imagine you come home from a long day of work and all you’ve consumed today is an iced coffee, a little bit of mouthwash you accidentally swallowed while brushing your teeth, and a protein bar. You go to the fridge because you’re starving and just need a quick snack before you start cooking. You see this cheese and decide to get a handful. 5 minutes later you’re sitting on the couch and over half the bag is gone....this was me tonight. The holy grail of cheeses!!
--------------------
Used it on my dinner and it was delicious
--------------------
Seriously one of my favorite cheese blends. Melts well and is perfect for tacos or nachos!
--------------------
I have never been motivated to write a review for shredded cheese, but after a year of doing keto and trying every shredded cheese in existence for making lo-carb quesadillas, Target brand Mexican-style shredded cheese is the most disgusting impersonation of shredded cheese I've ever come across. It doesn't melt right and ends up turning into a mix of oil and soft chewing gum. Stay away from whatever this is (I can't call it cheese) and buy literally any other brand of shredded cheese ever produced.
--------------------
Not a good store-brand equivalent. Rubbery, taste-less, and did not melt like many other brands and store brands. Good price but certainly will not purchase again.
--------------------
Loved this shredded cheese, melts great on eggs, or a cheese quesadilla. The flavor is Very good. I tried it on garlic bread as well and the melt was perfect so was the taste.
--------------------
Out favorite cheese! We made tacos with this and it was SO good and fresh. We are a big cheese family and this will be bought weekly for our house.
--------------------
I love this Mexican Style Shredded Cheese. I can use it for so many things since cheese is almost always a great thing to add to any meal. My favorite thing to use this cheese for is making nachos. I melt the cheese over tortilla chips and then add some sour cream and salsa. It is perfect! I love the blend of cheeses and how well they compliment each other.
--------------------
Great for taco night! Melted evenly on quesadillas as well. Comparable or better than the Market Pantry cheese I used to use.
--------------------
Very good shredded cheese. It's not finely shredded but it melts very quickly. My family liked the taste and texture. I actually prefer this brand over name brand. Its economically priced right with quality ingredients and great taste. Will be purchasing more in larger bags as this is a family fav.
--------------------
love the cheese on everything
--------------------
Perfect cheese! I also live the fine cut. Good flavor. Melts really well.
--------------------
Delicious cheese! Great for cooking!
--------------------
good taste for a good price
--------------------
This is the WORST cheese ever. It will not melt no matter how long you heat it up . It clumps up and stick together. HORRIBLE. Target need to stop selling this garbage.
--------------------
Like eating rubber without any flavor. Will not buy this brand again. Sorry Target switched to this brand.
--------------------
This brand has become a household favorite! I love using in my scrambled eggs, tacos, and chili. Has a balanced cheddar flavor and melts just right over a little heat.
--------------------
Probably the worst brand I’ve ever tried.  I hate buying off-brand cheese but for some reason Target doesn’t carry any name brand (Sargento, Crystal Farms, Kraft) options. Because I didn’t want to go to another store, I reluctantly bought this fake cheese.  It’s like little orange pieces of plastic.  I put some on chips and microwaved for 2 minutes.  Wasn’t shocked to see the cheese wasn’t melted.  Crystal Farms is melted in 45 seconds.  I’m not a brand snob but there are just some grocery items that aren’t good in the generic off-brands.  This is one of them.
If your looking for cheese that melts and tastes like real cheese, this isn’t it.  Keep shopping.
--------------------
Has a very waxy taste! Not impressed! My Target got rid of all the Market Pantry, and replaced it with Good & Gather, but they also got rid of Kraft. Not happy!
--------------------
I used it for baked Mac n cheese and it was a hit!
--------------------
I like this cheese. I still don’t like this good and gather brand that much. I can’t put my finger on it but there has been a change since it was market pantry. I would agree there is a taste different and melting difference
--------------------
I wish I could give it zero stars. It doesn't melt! It has an odd smell too. Don't waste your money. I had to throw mine away.
--------------------
We love this cheese, and use it almost daily in salads or recipes calling for melted cheese. In my experience, it melts well, and always tastes good.
--------------------
These cheese cost as much as kraft with out the quality. For example it doesn’t melt like normal cheese poor taste.
--------------------
OK product. My main concern is that these packs come defective. About half the time, opening as directed, ie, tearing off the top as indicated does not work half the time and one needs scissors any ways to open. I guess thats what they mean, it won't open, the bag stays gathered.
--------------------
Tastes a lot like sharp cheddar; hard to go wrong!
--------------------
Terrible taste. This abomination is an affront to all that is good and right about Cheese.
--------------------
We enjoy this cheese in our home, it melts great and tastes pretty good at half the price.
--------------------
Terrible. Apparently lots of people agree, because every other brand of cheese in my Target is always sold out and there's plenty of the Good and Gather brand.
--------------------
Tastes awful. Don't waste your money.
--------------------
Always stocked in our fridge
--------------------
The flavor of the Good & Gather cheese is awful in comparison to other brands. I prefer the Kraft shredded cheese that Target no longer carries.
--------------------
It’s very good and melts nicely. I like the creamy taste. I actually prefer it to Kraft brand cheese which is what I always used to get.
--------------------
Love this cheese! The taste is great and it melts amazingly into food! Please don’t stop carrying this blend of cheeses.
--------------------
Awful Cheese.  The first time I used it to cook with there was so much oil on top of the melted cheese it was dripping off. I only bought this in an emergency. I wish Target would bring back other brands for shredded cheese.
--------------------
Smells really strange. My more sensitive kid refuses to eat it (and I’m not offering to eat the rest, either, tbh).
--------------------
NOT QUESO CHEESE, do not attempt to use this cheese for queso. You will be disappointed. I have tried it twice, I thought the first time it was my error, it’s just terrible cheese. Use it for other things, just NOT queso.
--------------------
This cheese pack is the perfect amount for making a large platter of nachos. It melts well and is delicious, my mouth is watering just thinking about eating this cheese. Also works well for quesadillas or any other dish you need cheese for. This is your ticket to quick and easy meals.
--------------------
Great brand of cheese that’s hard to find at some supermarkets.
--------------------
A great tasting cheese. A little more pricey compared to other shredded cheese.
--------------------
This is the second time this has happened w this brand ! I love this cheese the thick cut , taste etc ! But I will buy it and after one week I start seeing oieces w blue green mold!! Months ahead of the eco date ! I got tired if it so took pics one shoes the package e the exp, date ( the moldy piece is in both pics but one is close up ! This cheese is fantastic so please do what rver you need to to fix this! I can’t trust this brand now !
--------------------
love it, great taste and melts very good
--------------------
Great for making pizzas with!
--------------------
The overall taste and texture was not good quality. I’m not why my local target only had this as an option. I threw the rest out. Would not purchase again
--------------------
I bought this product somewhat last minute for a recipe. It did the job, but I wasn't thrilled with the taste or texture. I found it rather bland and kind of dry (both on it's own and baked in a recipe).
--------------------
You know it’s horrible quality cheese when you try making Mac n cheese with it and instead of melting, it turns plastic-y. This was absolutely disgusting and ruined dinner. I had to throw everything away.
--------------------
I laughed at some of these reviews about funky cheese and bought this anyway because I needed cheese quickly. This stuff really doesn't melt, what is it?? My son won't eat it, so I'm stuck with bags of this weirdness that I have to force through my system. And it's not pretty. Beware!
--------------------
its cheese. it's not as melty or tastes as good as the shredded mexican cheese. it's aight it's not the best but it's not the worst. you get what you pay for i guess.
--------------------
it looks like cheese, but it doesn't behave like cheese. tastes ok when just eaten out of the bag but don't try to melt it. this "cheese" doesn't melt. i've put it in the oven at high temperature right under the burner, and after 5 minutes, you can still see individual shreds of cheese. i do not recommend this product at all.
--------------------
Not only does it taste horrible, it also takes FOREVER to melt, if at all. Odd texture.
--------------------
So I used this cheese for pizza and like my baked macaroni. HOWEVER, this cheese will not melt if you throw it on top of like chili or pasta fresh from the pot as shown in my picture. Idk why like my chili and pasta is literally burning hot as would any food coming out of a pot you just cooked out of but it seriously would not melt. So therefore if you buy this for baked items you should be good. Flavor wise I mean it’s not the best but for the price it is pretty good.
--------------------
We love this product and making pizza with this.. recommended
--------------------
Took forever to melt! I knew something was up because as soon as I opened it I noticed it felt hard compared to other mozzarellas. Will be avoiding Good & Gather cheeses going forward.
--------------------
Melts well and tastes like... cheese!
--------------------
Good quality for the price point
--------------------
This cheese is awful. It doesn’t melt right and even when it is melted, it has a very off putting taste. Don’t buy this.
--------------------
I mean really, it is no gourmet cheese, but I disagree with the comments that it does not melt. I couldn't find mozzarella cheese anywhere due to people panic buying during this pandemic. I found like two packs of this at my local Target and tried it on homemade pizza and lasagne. It is not as good as the brand I usually like, but it did what it is supposed to do and it did melt, unlike some of the other comments. It was not as horrible as described.
--------------------
I know most shredded cheeses don’t melt because of the anti caking ingredients, but this cheese doesn’t even budge! Horribly bland also.
--------------------
This cheese is oddly bland and takes forever to melt properly.  Hard pass
--------------------
Great value. It’s a big bag but stays fresh for quite a while.
--------------------
The flavor isn’t terrible but it’s like rubber when melted.
--------------------
Great size, lasts a few weeks at our house. Great taste, too!
--------------------
Legitimately will not melt. I saw the reviews about good & gather cheese doing this, but thought it must be a one off or something. Made a frozen dish for meal prep, baked it at 450 for 15 minutes, cheese is still frozen. Something is not right with these cheeses.
--------------------
Had this on pizza tonight, and it was probably the worst mozzarella cheese I've ever had. I'm honestly skeptical if this is even real cheese at all. It didn't melt properly, and the pieces just fused together. It had a texture I could only imagine would be like eating a handful of grass off the ground. It didn't even have a good flavor to make the horrible texture seen like less of a problem. I have never in countless brands experienced anything like this. Completely ruined dinner. Target should be ashamed selling this product.
--------------------
this stuff is honestly fantastic, if you're looking for a medium grade quality cheese look no further
--------------------
Flavor was what you’d expect of mozzarella, but it doesn’t completely melt. It’s still in shredded pieces even after heating more than I’ve heated any other brand, it was odd. It’s mozzarella, it’s made for melting; I thought.
--------------------
Great product and great value.
--------------------
Guys this stuff is amazing ! My entire family loves it... for the price are u kidding me ... to my family this taste better than anyyyyyy other brand !!
--------------------
Taste great and price is half of the brand name!
--------------------
Love that I can buy this online and lasts quite a while. Great taste, too.
--------------------
This cheese is by far better than the varieties of Parmesan carried in our local grocery store. Personally I also think it is way better than Kraft, which is SO over priced in my opinion. It is vibrant and has lots of cheesy flavors which will enhance any recipe which calls for it. Very thankful to have home delivery from Target!
--------------------
this is by far the best grated parmesan on the market
--------------------
This is by far the best pre grated Parmesan cheese. Great value for the price. This is a repurchase for me on a regular basis. Market Pantry has great products.
--------------------
It expires in one month!!! No way can I use all this. Maybe it is "best by" such and such date, but I want a longer period of time before it gets to that date!
--------------------
Perfect topper for any pasta.
--------------------
excellent parmesan cheese at a great price
--------------------
My favorite cheese. So thick and melts beautifully without being greesy. Great for grilled cheese, I've used it for Mac and cheese too.
--------------------
When I lived in Washington state, I discovered Tillamook. I was depressed to leave being it wasnt a National brand at that time. Now I can get my Oregon cheese fix wherever I am. Definitely the best cheese on the marketalbeit a little pricierbut so worth the price.
--------------------
We use the 4 cheese Mexican blend for fajitas, tacos and nachos. My family loves that the shreds are nice and thick so they have a great strong flavor.
--------------------
So good! I use it on all of my quesadillas and other meals at home. I love it so much.
--------------------
This cheese tastes delicious and doesnt have that artificial taste that pre shredded cheese can have. It melts beautifully and I love the look of the large shreds in food photos. Great quality cheese :)
--------------------
I LOVE THIS CHEESE!! I keep at minimum 3 bags of this in my refrigerator at all times. It is perfect with everything.
--------------------
I love Tillamook cheeses and I was looking for a good melting cheese to go with Mexican food — the other three cheeses in this blend fit the bill, but the cheddar kind of ruins it! I love a good sharp cheddar, but it really doesn’t belong in this blend! Unfortunately, the vast majority of it is cheddar!￼ It’s definitely not equal amounts of all four varieties!￼
--------------------
Best cheese ever! I use this all the time in burrito bowls and quesadillas. It melts so well.
--------------------
Love tillamook cheese! Good quality. I am a vegetarian so am very glad there are brands like tillamook out there that don’t use any animal rennet.
--------------------
I love all Tillamook Shredded Cheeses, this one in particular I buy for when I make quesadilla. Melts well and tastes good. I love the farm style thick cut. Highly recommend and it's a good price value!
--------------------
Staple in our house. Great for fajitas, tacos, quesadillas. We always keep this cheese in the house and loyal to the Tillamook brand as we are from Portland, Or about 1.5 hours from Tillamook, Or.
--------------------
No other cheese compares! This takes cheese to another level. Larger shreds, more flavor. Not oily when melted.
--------------------
The flavor is fantastic, and the cheese melts really well. It’s perfect for enchiladas, tacos, beans, and even sprinkled on soup or potatoes. I love the thickness as well because it’s not as messy as the finely shredded cheese.
--------------------
Doesn't taste like fake cheese like a lot of brands do. Perfect for quesdillas or adding to any meal that tastes great with cheese (just about everything). I always recommend this brand to family and friends.
--------------------
Love this cheese! It’s taste good and melts amazingly into food!
--------------------
This cheese is the best. Since the pandemic lockdown situation started, we’ve been making pizzas every Friday night. This cheese melts so well and the pizza turns out great every time! Love the blend!
--------------------
I love these larger pieces of cheese! They melt well and I like they way I can taste the cheese when in my salads. Tillamook is very high quality and I’m happy my target carries it now.
--------------------
Good and Gather shredded cheese is the cheapest shredded cheese I’ve been able to find anywhere, a bag of shredded sharp cheddar cheese (in my experience) can cost at least a few dollars more than this, so it’s the only cheese I buy anymore. That said, it does not have as strong a flavor as you would expect from a sharp cheddar. If you’re looking for very flavorful cheese, other brands are probably better, but just for casual use this cheese is very good for the value.
--------------------
I love to add into my eggs and mashed potatoes!
--------------------
This cheese was terrible. It ruined my Chicken Spaghetti. The cheese had absolutely no taste and it was very clumpy and oily. My Chicken Spaghetti was soupy with this cheese. Target needs to STOP forcing their terrible store brands on customers and offer other name brands that are higher quality and taste better.
--------------------
Has almost no flavor, definitely isn't sharp cheddar. Don't recommend it at all
--------------------
Terribly tasteless.  A year ago their shredded cheese was alright.  Nothing great, but what you want in basic shredded cheese.  It got worse, so we started buying the Kraft shredded cheese.  Now that they've switched to the Good and Gather new branding, they removed the Kraft from the store as an option.  So, we tried it again.  Even more tasteless.
--------------------
Love this cheese, don’t love this price.
--------------------
The cheese is good. My only complaint is that this bag is about $4.00 and yet you only get half the bag full of cheese. It shouldn’t be worth that much
--------------------
OK product. My main concern is that these packs come defective. About half the time, opening as directed, ie, tearing off the top as indicated does not work half the time and one needs scissors any ways to open. I guess thats what they mean, it won't open, the bag stays gathered.
--------------------
the truth is that it is not my favorite !!! But the ones I've tried are one of the best, the flavor is milky apart from the fact that it's smooth and I love that, my children love quesadillas, so that's why it's incredible.
--------------------
Great cheese to put on pizza. Has a great spreading and melting quality!!!!! Repeat customer.
--------------------
Huge shreds as always, Tillamook has an unbeatable quality about them when it comes to flavor and reliability.
--------------------
Once again Tillamook is my favorite brand I love to use this on my DiGiorno self-rising pizza crust it makes a delicious pizza this cheese does
--------------------
My favorite cheese brand!! Love having mozzarella on hand for pizza or pasta nights. Creamy, smooth, and so melty, the Tillamook mozzarella is the best!
--------------------
I just finished a bag of Tillamook shredded mozzarella! It came in a larger,thicker shred which was prefect for the pizza I made! Cheese was perfectly salty and melty on the pizza. Great pizza needs great ingredients!
--------------------
Very high quality cheese and packaging. Tastes amazing! The price point is very fair.
--------------------
I love the thick cut of [product:tillamook-mozzarella-shredded-cheese]. I love how it tastes on fresh salads and when I sprinkle it on spaghetti. There is nothing I can think of to improve this item. The packaging is great. I will keep buying it in the future and will definitely recommend it to people.
--------------------
I am lactose intolerant, so for me to say I like this cheese means a lot. I enjoy how thick the mozzarella is, and once you taste it you can immediately tell it's a lot better than other cheeses in terms of quality. It is a bit on the more expensive side, but it's definitely worth it!
--------------------
This is the best cheese to use on any homemade pizza I decided to make it so creamy and delicious
--------------------
For me halal matters and this cheese has a stamp that it is halal. I gave bought it several times. It melts easily. I feel that for the price you dont get a lot of product but anyways not many halal choices so u would buy it.
--------------------
We use this on our homemade pizzas, its super creamy, easy to melt and tastes delicious. We also like the Mexican blend for taco night and my oldest son likes the sharp cheddar cheese for a snack!
--------------------
Tillamook is probably my favorite generic cheese brand. If Im not looking for something artisanal, then this is the brand Im choosing. I like that the shredded cheese is thicker shreds than what you normally find in the grocery aisle and it has a richer flavor.
--------------------
Tasted just right and melts perfection Made nacho cheese chips it had just right amount in the package
--------------------
This stuff is so freaking good I use it for my lasagna and my kids loved it. I sometimes just eat it plain because its so good. It is very pricy though so I try to get others like it most of the time but for a nicer meal do not be afraid to try this stuff
--------------------
Best shredded cheese to use for homemade pizzas! Rich and creamy once melted. 10/10.
--------------------
I was skeptical ordering this but it was the only 8oz mozzarella cheese that was available for pick up the day i was ordering. And goodness!! It was soooo goooddddd! A little bit expensive than the good and gather cheese but it was worth every peny i spent.
--------------------
Tillamook Cheese is not available in every store near us, but this is the cheese we prefer. The shredded cheese is thick and full of flavor. The price is a little more expensive compared to the competition, but it is worth the flavor!
--------------------
Its cheese. Its delicious and I use it on both meatball subs and homemade pizza. It melts nicely and easier that grating it by hand.
--------------------
My go-to cheese for all my salads and tacos dishes. Great taste and easy to cook with.
--------------------
I was skeptical about this cheese due to the cost but it was the last pre-shredded mozzarella on the shelf and I decided to give it a try. You can absolutely see and taste the difference in quality in this cheese. It tasted great and melted even better. This was a major upgrade from the crappy Good & Gather brand I was going for. If you can afford it, I’d definitely recommend this cheese. It is quite expensive though, so I probably won’t be buying it regularly.
--------------------
We LOVE cheese here in my house . Im constantly buying it ! Tillamook is my go-to. It tastes fresh , and has a nice texture . It isnt Oily or have a weird residue like a lot of other cheeses do.
--------------------
Really great shredded mozzarella. I like the thicker shred, I think it melts better and it's easier to get good coverage on things like pizza, lasagna or eggplant parm.
--------------------
The Cadillac of cheeses. You can tell this is a luxury brand when it comes to cheese.
--------------------
Great cheese! It tastes delicious. I make homemade pizzas at home and it tastes so fresh. Mozzarella melts well and all sooo goey. Can't go back.
--------------------
Used this product for making Mexican dishes. The cheese melted wonderfully and tasted great. We liked that it was shredded in larger individual pieces!
--------------------
My coworker said she didnt like any other kind of brand but Tillamook cheese. I decided to try it and Ill have to agree. The mozzarella just tastes way better than other popular brands. It may cost a little more but totally worth it. I will definitely by be buying it again.
--------------------
This is the only cheese my household will eat. Its got great taste/flavor. I love how its shredded. We use it on pizzas, tacos, chili dogs, you name it. I used to carry a variety of brands but this is by far the best.
--------------------
Pretty affordable brand and great quality. I love using the mozzarella shredded cheese in many dishes (example: asparagus, mushrooms & chicken breast topped with panko breading and lots of cheese). I also enjoy the Mexican cheese blends. Perfect for quesadillas, omelets, and fajitas.
--------------------
Rich, creamy cheese that always does the trick! Love it on pizza, mixed in with scrambled eggs, with some tomatoes and basil
--------------------
My go to grocery store brand for shredded cheese. Ideal for build your own pizza night. Really thick and delicious!
--------------------
I love this cheese so much because it makes it so much more easier for me to use and it doesn’t require much work!
--------------------
Mozzarella cheese is one of my favorite cheeses. This is a great mozzarella cheese to use when cooking because the cheese is very high quality and fresh. It’s probably the best brand you can get at the store that is packaged.
--------------------
Love all the Tillamook shredded cheeses. We like that they’re thick cut. Great for meals, but my kids prefer this one most on cheese quesadillas.
--------------------
This is by far my favorite brand of cheese. I love the thick cut pieces and creamy texture. This is perfect to top a homemade pizza or chicken Parmesan. This has definitely become a staple in my fridge!
--------------------
I love tillamook everything. Before they were in stores in my city I actually used to drive 4 hours to get some at the nearest Kroger’s. This mozzarella is great for pizza night!
--------------------
I love this whole brand!! I don’t mind paying the little bit extra for this because the quality is so good and I can truly taste the difference. I’ve also noticed that when I need to melt this cheese, it melts very naturally, I never get the sense that there is anything weird in it.
--------------------
This is my favorite mozzarella pre shredded cheese.
--------------------
I like the " thick cut farm style " Tillamook shredded mozzarella more than the regular one. I grabbed this one only because they were out of the other one.
--------------------
My kids love it, I like the thick cut
--------------------
I really really like this big farm style mozzarella cheese. It also has a new style of packaging to. I use it mainly when I’m cooking breakfast. I throw it in my eggs or anything else that I might be making. It melts down extremely well and has a great flavor
--------------------
Tillamook is so good. Melts like a dream, has great flavor. Tastes like real cheese, simple easy to understand ingredients. Makes the best grilled cheese.
--------------------
good cheese. i don't know why that one person gave a one-star rating.
--------------------
It was my first time purchasing this item. I actually really like it. Thickly cut cheese but melts on a pizza within minutes. Tastes very smooth. Flavor just melts on your taste buds!
--------------------
Tillamook is by far our favorite brand of cheese. The mozzarella tastes great and doesn’t dry out. It also has no powdered cellulose - very important to us. The resealable bag is great. We always have this on hand. It is a tad pricier than other brands, but a much better product in taste. [product:tillamook-shredded-mozzarella-cheese]
--------------------
I’ve used every product this brand comes out with. You simply cannot go wrong with any of them. For taste, health, and your family,.,.pick Tillamook!
--------------------
Hands down worth the price I tried this brand not to long ago and was extremely impressed my only issue is it doesn’t come in a bigger bag at least not at my grocery store
--------------------
It sounds weird, but this shredded mozzarella from Tillamook is one that we always have on hand. We use it for breakfast in the morning on eggs, and in pasta and chicken dishes at night. This cheese is so good that I can’t use any other!
--------------------
I only recently started purchasing Tillamook cheeses. Game changer for sure- this cheese is fresh! And also love that the ones we get don’t contain any pork rennet! Woohoo :)
--------------------
Tillamook is the best product in the market. The texture and taste are superior to any other. I love that I can buy the whole block or the shreds and the quality is the same. I always have this in my refrigerator.
--------------------
Tillamook cheese has a permanent place in our fridge. These are perfect in lunches or as a grab and go snack! Tastes just as great as fresh off the block!
--------------------
Tillamook's products never disappoint. The texture is nice and doesn't crumb when cut. The only bad thing to say is that the price is high.
--------------------
Tillamook is on all around good brand it never lets you down in the nice sharp cheddar cheese is delicious in my salads and grilled cheese sandwiches
--------------------
I love this brand and purchase this product often for everyday use. The flavor and texture is exactly what I wanted and the price is on point as well.
--------------------
Tillamook is one of my favorite got to cheese whenever I want to get it done right. The taste is so good it melts very well. I use to hand grade my cheese the flavor is out of this world good. I definitely would recommend this to anyone who loves great cheeses!
--------------------
No other cheese comes close to Tillamook. It melts perfectly, it tastes great, it comes packaged in a variety of ways, and the ingredients are high quality. The price isnt bad either. Totally worth the extra buck.
--------------------
Tillamook cheeses are the best!!! Especially the shredded ones as there is no work to be done to shred it.. I use it for everything but for baked macaroni and cheese it is the best!!! It is pretty competitively priced and well worth the money...
--------------------
This is really good and full flavourful cheese. I think it's perfect for charcuterie boards or just eat in its own. The only draw back is that it's kinda expensive. But it's definitely worth the price think you get what you pay for. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.
--------------------
Great flavor, easy to grate and slice. We use this often in our keto cooking. Will buy again.
--------------------
Creamy and sharp. Perfect size for sandwiches not too thin and not too thick. Good for cheese and crackers also but I usually break into smaller pieces for crackers.
--------------------
Smooth creamy, easy to melt and a nice strong flavor. This Sharp cheddar is great for Mac n cheese.
--------------------
Very high quality cheese and packaging. Tastes amazing! The price point is very fair.
--------------------
Great cheesey sharp flavor. Creamy. Doesnt taste fake or rubbery. Love this cheese.
--------------------
At all the cheeses we have ever had this one is our family favorite. I love that we can buy it in bulk. Tillamook sharp cheddar is the tastiest and you can use it in so many different things. It feels like it is the cheese that is the least processed
--------------------
Just picked this badboy up for Thanksgiving week. My family all loves to do fly-bys in the kitchen when I'm grating cheese for string bean casserole. This is my fav cheese to use on the regular. It's creamy and delicious. I like both sharp and mild cheddar. Great for things like quesadillas too.
--------------------
That product is a great value for the budget. It has lots of flavor and doesn't taste just like a traditional but a snack youll we njoy throughout the day . You will be pleasantly surprised when you try this Item
--------------------
I love cheese! Sharp cheddar is my favorite. I eat it by itself most of the time or put a slice on crackers. Tillamook is my favorite brand. So creamy with a great sharp taste.
--------------------
this is great cheese. It's got a great sharpness to it and it melts like it's supposed to. Great for any dish.
--------------------
This sliced cheese is great for sandwiches and great for burgers. It has a great sharpness and it just adds great flavor.
--------------------
this is the best tasting cheese. The quality is great. They also have a great selection of different flavors of great ice cream.
--------------------
We all love this cheese. Both my kids (2,14) are big cheese eaters so we go through a lot of cheese. I buy this all the time, we really enjoy the sharp.
--------------------
Solid cheese block which can be used for variety of things. We slice for grilled cheese, shred for Mac and Cheese and cut up for snacks with crackers. Not too sharp; not too mild
--------------------
Tillamook is a great local company. I always buy their slices cheese for sandwiches. They are great to pack for any camping trips!
--------------------
Its the OG cheese block in my house. We love it and use it for everything. No substitute.
--------------------
Its cheese what can I say lol. It tastes exactly how cheese is supposed to taste! Its super good and my fiancé throws a little fit every time I try to buy a different brand
--------------------
Tillamook cheeses are very good! Maybe the best Ive tried, a little more expensive than other brands but I would say the price is worth it.
--------------------
I've been eating this cheese for years. I mean I'm 29 and since I was a kid. My favorite hands down.. Nothing really compares. Well, other than other prices. But I don't mind
--------------------
The best cheddar cheese ever! Great with French bread and red wine. Also makes the perfect grilled cheese.
--------------------
I love how even though this cheese is shredded its still in bigger pieces. It tastes super good, Tillamook has some of the best cheese.
--------------------
Tillamook is probably my favorite generic cheese brand. If Im not looking for something artisanal, then this is the brand Im choosing. I like that the shredded cheese is thicker shreds than what you normally find in the grocery aisle and it has a richer flavor.
--------------------
Im not big on shredded cheese but given the quality and reputation of tillamook, I gave it a try to cut grating cheese time for all my keto entrees. This help me cut my prep time down and taste just as fresh as if I had just grated it. Will continue to purchase.
--------------------
So far this has been my most favorite cheeses that they could possibly have available. Tillamook Sharp Cheddar Shredded Cheese, 1lb
--------------------
seriously the best shredded cheese out there! the only kind on the market you can find like this and well worth the price!!

This cheese is sooooo good! I love how the shreds are large! It melts smoothly on my food and tastes amazing!
--------------------
Our favorite brand of cheese! Melts super easy. Great for taco night. We always have at least two bags on hand in our house. Well priced!
--------------------
I now only buy tillamook cheese and ice cream and others made by this brand because of how good and creamy everything is. The flavor is so amazing and rich. I usually try to buy the bigger ones so then it is creamy and delicious.
--------------------
Tillamook is my absolute favorite cheese brand. The flavor is far superior to most and the texture is wonderful.
--------------------
The shredded thick sliced is the one I got. I added it to homemade cauliflower and broccoli soup and it was AMAZING! I liked that it was thicker sliced shredded so as it melted you knew it was there, if you know what I mean!
--------------------
I love this cheese. It is already thick sliced for burgers or sandwiches. I used it to max out the cheese capacity on my macaroni this year. It is a bit pricey but if you catch it on sale, you should stock up. Its really that delicious. I think this is my new favorite brand of cheese!
--------------------
The best shredded cheddar that exists! The large shreds melts so well and is really just the best shredded cheese. We love supporting the farmers of tillamook
--------------------
SO good! Not only is the flavor of this cheddar cheese excellent, but the texture is superb. I love the extra thick shreds. They make the flavor really stand out, especially as a topping for chili or tacos.
--------------------
Great for sandwiches or quesadillas. Tillamook is good for dairy products. Lasts a while too
--------------------
My go to cheese for a tuna melt with sourdough bread. Really sharp and flavorful. The slices are really nice and thick.
--------------------
Love that tillamook is so strong in flavors. Not all cheese is created equal. Price is kinda high but I guess what you pay for. This is one of those things you can actually taste the difference compared to other brand
--------------------
This is the best cheese. It has a taste that is bold and sharp that is balanced by a creaminess. The best!
--------------------
Perfect for a cheeseboard. People rave about this cheese... you can really taste the high quality difference! Love this company for the high standards they set.
--------------------
Love using this for my enchiladas, tacos, and macaroni dishes. Great taste and easy to cook with.
--------------------
I just love this cheese it's my favorite. I like sharp cheese some people don't like it but get me some wheat thins or any type of crackers and go to town. It's my comfort food.
--------------------
the very handiest way to use sharp cheddar!! open the bag, grab a handful and sprinkle all over your food for a taste sensation!! This is a staple in the household!! Absolutely recommend-the price point is comparable to similar products. great stuff!! #Tillamook Sharp Cheddar Shredded Cheese, 1lb

I am a sharp cheddar kind of gal and it can be hard to find a great sharp cheddar without emptying the bank account. Tillamook has that brilliant perfectly sharp taste and texture. It is a great addition to my lunch sandwiches or melted over an entree. highly recommend! #[product:tillamook-sharp-cheddar-cheese-slices]

We LOVE cheese here in my house . Im constantly buying it ! Tillamook is my go-to. It tastes fresh , and has a nice texture . It isnt Oily or have a weird residue like a lot of other cheeses do.
--------------------
When i get this cheese i have to hide it from the rest of my family, its that good. I recently trued thus cheese and it has become one of my favs to eat
--------------------
This is a great sharp cheddar. It has a nice flavor and actually tastes like cheese. It melts nicely. Its a tad more expensive than other brands but I think its worth it for a tastier cheddar. I would buy it again and highly recommend it!
--------------------
I love Tillamook. The shredded cheddar works great for everything from salads to nachos.
--------------------
This is the best shredded cheese you can buy. Its hard for me to resist eating cheese shred by shred. Big pieces that dont stick together!
--------------------
Really great value and taste. Perfect for using in cooking dishes or even as a snack.
--------------------
I love the taste of this cheese because the taste is so fresh and I love the tartness of this cheese. I can't think of any improvements for this cheese.
--------------------
Tillamook is the best. I love the flavor and I love the way its grated. I put it on everything.
--------------------
Perfect for burgers, or just eating plain. Tillamook cheese is consistently good and a staple!
--------------------
Love tillamook cheese on sandwiches. Good on everything. Really love with omelets too
--------------------
I love anything tillamook puts out and the cheese is no accept ion. Very good for sandwiches, just wish there were more slices
--------------------
Best shredded cheese I have purchased. I didnt feel like I was eating hard cheese like other brands...food taste and the cheese was a softer feel than others. I recommend and have repurchased several times.
--------------------
The only sliced cheese we buy! Perfect for grilled cheese or early morning breakfast sandwiches. Melts perfectly and the perfect sharpness.
--------------------
Great creamy cheese! It works well with any dish or by itself as a quick snack. Always a quality product.
--------------------
Thick slices of real cheese! None of that plastic taste here. Definitely worth spending a little extra to get a lot more flavor. Its a bit hard to melt since the slices are so thick, but the extra few minutes isnt a big deal when you taste the result!
--------------------
It taste like cheese. I definitely can tell it is a higher quality but it is a title pricey. If you have the money to spend do it. But its nothing special either
--------------------
Tried it once, havent looked back. The thick cut is my favorite! Much more high quality than other slices we have tried. Started buying the snack sized cheese as well.
--------------------
Tillamook makes the best cheese. It is rich and creamy. It melts perfectly and is delicious. I can eat it cold or hot.
--------------------
Tillamook cheese never disappoints I really love the flavor of it and I know I can always make family favorites with this cheese this brand is my go to
--------------------
I love tillamook cheeses. Visited the factory on Oregon coast and impressed by the setup and quality!
--------------------
The BEST shredded cheese. Can definitely tell the difference compared to normal shredded cheese. Anything Tillamook is good.
--------------------
This cheese is yummy and so creamy. My whole family loves it! Great in tomato soup and on a quesadilla! Worth trying
--------------------
I love this cheese! If had such great flavor and it cuts so smoothly. It is a little more expensive than some other cheeses but I feel its worth it.
--------------------
I love Tillamook sharp cheddar. It's got just enough zip that it isn't boring and is amazing with apples. It also hold together we'll and doesn't just crumble apart. It also melts decently for sandwiches or an extra flavor kick on pizza or in lasagna.
--------------------
This is beginning to be our new favorite household brand. The cheese is just hands down the best. I love the thick cut shreds. It’s just awesome
--------------------
1000010% my favorite splurge when I’m grocery shopping. The quality is amazing, & I love the thick cuts in the cheese. Great on baked potatoes, beans, & tacos!! Pricey but worth the extra spend for the quality in this brand
--------------------
Extra sharp cheddar cheese is the best cheese in the entire world. I always have a block of this cheese in my fridge at all times. I also love that you can get little personal travel sizes of those that are perfect for lunch.
--------------------
Best shredded cheese on the market.
--------------------
Tillamook cheese is so yummy! Great cheddar flavor, super creamy and make amazing grilled cheeses or sliced for cheese and crackers.
--------------------
I recently found this brand and I really like it. This will sound a bit strange, but this actually taste like I grated the cheese myself. I have tried a lot of shredded cheddars and Mexican cheeses and although they are good, I really can taste the difference in the flavor. This is a true cheddar not processed and not a dry cheddar cheese. I use the extra sharp as well. The picture is seasoned ground meat with Tillamook sharp cheddar with street corn dressing . Like a nacho just without the chips. This cheese can be used with so many things. I will now look to use this cheese than my regular brand.
--------------------
No other cheese can I enjoy. This cheese is amazing and a thick cut is really a good taste￼. The cows are not treated with rBST. It’s also aged over nine months before it’s packaged and sent out. I love that it’s all natural. It does cost more than your average cheese but well worth it. ￼
--------------------
My fiancé wanted to try tillamook one day at the store randomly. We brought it home and now it’s our go to cheese- it has real creamy flavor.
--------------------
Favorite cheese! One we keep buying on repeat! Love the flavor. Perfect for snacking on or making a grilled cheese sandwich.
--------------------
This is hands down the best cheese I’ve ever tasted. It is kind of pricy compared to other brands but so worth it.
--------------------
This is my favorite cheese! Always tastes amazing for the cost. Of course its pricier than a store brand cheese but worth every penny. It's great cold or melted
--------------------
The absolute best sharp@cheddar I’ve ever had! Full of flavor without the oily texture of other brands. Absolutely worth the extra cost because you dont need as much for the Mac flavor!
--------------------
Husbands favorite cheese. Great flavor, we use it with everything and would highly recommend
--------------------
You would think cheese brand doesn’t matter, but tillamook totally does! It is the best cheese i have ever tasted. Just the quality of the product is so good. It makes everything you put it on taste more rich, and tillamook cheese with crackers is heaven. Its a little pricy compared to other cheeses but i don’t mind paying a little more for the better quality.
--------------------
Terrific in a grilled cheese sandwich, sliced very thinly. We always have a brick in the fridge.
--------------------
This is my go to cheese for everything. Grilled cheese, just to eat or to put on crackers. It's a nice sharp cheddar flavor.
--------------------
Great tasting thick shredded sharp cheddar cheese! My go to cheese and definitely reasonably price compared to other cheeses available. Highly recommend!
--------------------
This seemed like the best option at the store. The cheese looks a little dry, but I believe that's because it's not coated like other highly processed shredded cheeses, so I would imagine that it melts well, but I did not try this myself.
--------------------
My dad grew up in Tillamook, so I’m a built-in fan. The sharp is my favorite. It you get the chance-go to the factory. Its been totally remodeled, fancy and full of deliciousness!
--------------------
Sharp is the way to go for your Mac n Cheese recipes...try adding a can of cream of mushroom soup, one cup of mayo and one cup of milk for a quick tasty dinner Mac n Cheese!
--------------------
I only eat this melted or in salad. So good.
--------------------
The taste is very different, but not horrible. I liked it in tacos and on top of chilli dogs, but idk if I'd use it in more intimate recipes. I am trying to wean off of dairy and meat products as easily as I can...this was a good start. I'd like to see if I can find a cheaper option, though!
--------------------
Best vegan cheese! It melts and has a great flavor.
--------------------
Sorry, but truthfully this cheese taste disgusting. It has a terrible bitter aftertaste. I have yet to find a vegan cheese that taste good. Even my family dislikes this cheese. It melts weird.
--------------------
This cheese alternative doesn't melt well and is stringy when melted. It also has a funny taste (you get used to it though). It's not a bad alternative, just needs some tweaking.
--------------------
I bought this as I am starting my journey to phase out dairy. I love cheese and saw several reviews on Daiya cheeze. I did not like it cold. However, it was good warm; it actually reminded me of cheddar. I was happy it melted. I will keep trying it in recipes
--------------------
I’ve been vegan for almost 5 years. That being said, when I first tried products from daiya (nearly 5 years ago), I hated them. I thought they were disgusting. And there wasn’t as many options as there are now. Since then, they have changed their ingredients. I now find myself buying a lot of their products! This cheese was new to me! I haven’t had a cheese replacement like this ever! To me, it’s really good. I mix a little bit of the “mozzarella” and “cheddar” kind together, throw it in the microwave on a tortilla, and voila! It melts and spreads just like real cheese. And melted, it has the same texture. An easy food that I used to enjoy before I was vegan and now I am able to with a great alternative! To people who are used to eating the real thing, this might be gross to them. But for long term vegans, I believe this is a great option.
--------------------
I bought this when it was on sale after discovering I an lactose intolerance. I have to say, both variations that target carries are horrible. They taste sort of tangy/sweet and they melt in an odd consistency. I made a lasagna with it, and it sort of melded together and just sat on top of the pasta. Definitely do not reccomend.
--------------------
So...I honestly want to like this product but the smell just gets me. It hits HARD and it doesn’t melt very well but when I put a bunch in my quesadilla, it melted perfectly. A lot goes a long way. The smell gets me, it’s texture is like chalky yet slimy carrots.
--------------------
It’s alright... The taste is really good but the texture is off. It melts kind of slowly and when it is melted it’s a little slimy which is weird but not awful. It’s pretty bad cold, the texture feels like it’s dried out and chalky so I wouldn’t eat it without melting it. But overall it isn’t bad and I’ve used it multiple times. But I can’t say I’m going to stop looking for a better cheese substitute.
--------------------
Just started buying this about a month ago and I’m hooked! I’m phasing dairy out of most of my meals, and when this cheese is melted it really mimics real cheese (can’t say I recommend it cold!).
--------------------
Everyone’s taste buds are different, I love this cheese and use it everyday! Mostly for quesadillas or in eggs but I’d use it in anything. My husband isn’t a huge fan which is fine by me cause it’s expensive and I’d rather not share :) I think it melts SO well and I’ve used a lot of dairy free cheeses over the years.
--------------------
This non dairy cheese melts, which is rare compared to other non dairy cheese on the market and it tastes good too.
--------------------
My dairy free daughter loves it cold or melted. I like it too! Definitely a decent alternative to regular cheese.
--------------------
I truly wanted to love this product but it’s just.....nasty. The taste was very tangy. It never truly melted like cheese on my nachos and retained a very slimy, greasy texture. I felt like gagging. The smell was not bad but that texture is a deal breaker. Sigh!
--------------------
My kid’s have to eat dairy free and it’s a bit of a drag at times. They absolutely love this cheese melted for nachos! Such a lifesaver. Love the Daiya brand pizzas too! Wonderful for those with food allergies!
--------------------
So horrible.. First time eating it.. I ate it with a grill cheese sandwich. 10 mins later in the restroom.
--------------------
I'm very glad I tried it myself instead of going by the reviews. At the end of the day, we all have different taste buds! This cheese is best melted, thats when the flavor really pops out. So far I've used it on quesadillas, nachos and grilled cheese and was surprised how good it was. I'm new to following a plant based diet (and lactose intolerant) and this will definitely be a staple from now on.
--------------------
Put this on my salad as an alternative to cheese and it just tastes bland, chews like dried out cheese, and is just all-around awful. I will keep looking.
--------------------
Melts well and tastes great! I love using it for quesadillas and grilled cheese. Love that it's vegan.
--------------------
Really tasty and great price!
--------------------
Bought this cheese on 8/8/2020. Opened it 8/9/2020. It says it goes bad 9/02/2020. It’s already moldy and i am not finding a way to submit for a refund online. Highly disappointed as I needed this for Sunday dinner
