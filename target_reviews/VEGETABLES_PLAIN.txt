Have never bought mushroom that have not been washed. Never again.
--------------------
I’ve been making beef stroganoff a few weeks in a row and always do drive up with Target. On all four orders, there was no expiration date on the mushrooms and they were spoiled so bad they smelled like rotten fish. So disgusting! Please Target, fix those expiration dates on the packages so they don’t get sold and picked when the product has been spoiled for days.
--------------------
The last two times I ordered these, the ones I received were rotten and several days past the sell-by date. It's also really annoying that they aren't pre-washed. Kind of defeats the purpose of having them pre-sliced.
--------------------
Great condition and tasted delicious!
--------------------
Really dirty. It’s hard to wash sliced mushrooms so I don’t recommend this product.
--------------------
I will microwave and freeze these, since they are about to go bad. They really should not sell mushrooms in this condition.
--------------------
Bought these at my local Target and they worked well in the brown gravy I prepared for dinner. The package has a good amount for cooking a couple of meals. They have a clear Saran Wrap top so you can inspect for freshness. I recommend giving them a gentle wash with water (as with all produce) before consuming.
--------------------
Great quality and easy drive-up pickup.
--------------------
good. good price too.
--------------------
One of the mushroom packages was fine, and the other was reduced in price as old, though I did not receive the reduced price.
--------------------
They are so ￼delicious! I just open the bag and munch on them as a snack.
--------------------
moldy before expiration
--------------------
Staple in my home! Always come in a good size.
--------------------
I buy these every week. Never had any issue with them and they are good quality. I cut them in half and roast them.
--------------------
These are great, I buy two bags a week and eat them with dinner. Cut them in half, throw them in a pan with a little oil and spices, then add a bit of water and cover the pan and let them steam, always delicious. They have always been fresh and clean and ready to be used.
--------------------
Brussels Sprouts looked brown and rotten.
--------------------
I wanted to get fresh (unpackaged) brussels sprouts to roast, but they didn't have any so I got this instead.  Since I wasn't going to steam them, I opened the bag to cut them up. They were NOT trimmed and certainly NOT clean.  I had to trim and wash all of them. 
 I ended up throwing out about 4 or 5 of the sprouts since they either had bugs or dirt embedded in them.  I get that produce is going to have bugs from time to time, and expect that when I'm preparing and trimming unpackaged veggies.  But in a bag that clearly states "Washed, Trimmed & Ready to Eat",  this was a disappointment and waste of money.
--------------------
I almost didn’t buy due to other reviews but I have no complaints.
--------------------
not sure what others got, but it was fresh and salad'ful 2 me.
--------------------
It wasn’t the least bit satisfying. Would not buy again.
--------------------
Would you eat that? I didn't think so. This is at least 1 of my 9 ounces.
--------------------
This salad was mushy and was not expired yet. Very disappointed
--------------------
Salad sas brown and wilted even though nowhere near exp date
--------------------
I liked that there is purple cabbage in the mix, as I've noticed some other brands don't do that.
--------------------
The coleslaw expiration date was 4/7/20.  This item should have been removed from the refrigeration shelf.  That would have eliminated it from being selected. 

This rating does not reflect the shopper.  Our shopper Alexandra was the best, she communicated with me while she was taking care of my order.  Alexandra was great, she is a 10. Excellent shopper!!!!

Thank You
--------------------
I love this spinach! So easy and convenient to make, plus it is usually very fresh.
--------------------
There is something so delicious about this particular spinach. Can eat the entire bag and I usually can’t eat spinach like that. Buy it!
--------------------
I don't know why, but this spinach is just my favorite spinach of all the bagged spinach. It's delicious right out of the bag or after being heated up. Too bad target is too far to get my morning spinach from there everyday :( Target please open a store right by me
--------------------
Great spinach, this bag is cheaper than the smaller 5oz bag too.
--------------------
This is the best price that I’ve ever seen for pre-washed spinach!
--------------------
Fresh and lasted long
--------------------
I've bought this a few times because it's cheap and tastes fine. However, fair warning, make sure you wash them even though it says prewashed. I found a chunk of mud on some leaves in one bag and was disturbed having realized I ate some of it a day earlier and didn't notice the mud. Complained to Target and got a refund. I still tend to buy it cuz again it's cheap, but I haven't noticed it again. However I definitely wash the bag everytime. To be safe, Target should just not advertise it as "no need to wash" . Wash your spinach people!
--------------------
good price. good spinach
--------------------
it's always fresh and last a pretty long time for spinach after opened. It's sometimes out of stock a lot which really sucks but a good product and good price as well.
--------------------
It’s been great and fresh every time for me, even better than when I buy it myself at the grocery store.
--------------------
This salad is no good. Ate some the first night and felt fine. Had some the next day for lunch, not even two hours later I was sick from it in the restroom. I didn’t think it was the salad until I had a little more for dinner, and boom... two hours later I was back in the restroom. It must expire fast and probably isn’t from a good source. Never had issues with salad from a regular grocery store. Buyer beware..
--------------------
This was dated 6 days from my date of purchase yet it was completely rotted.
--------------------
I understand reviews on how others had theirs gross and soggy but I always pick mine and look through it carefully. I’ve never had a problem and it’s great for my family of 5! Nice bowl of salad before a meal and all I have to do is add whatever I want. Sometimes I just clean them and through out a bottle of dressing and even my kids love this salad. It’s a basic salad bag! Give it a little something : )
--------------------
Usually old and unusable by the next day.
--------------------
Expires fast, not fresh, slimey
--------------------
This would be a great salad mix for the price but every time I’ve ordered it for pick up I get an expired batch.
--------------------
lettuce was soggy and no good.
--------------------
Old lettuce. The lettuce is rotten in the bag and all brown
--------------------
Solid salad package. No complaints.
--------------------
Never had any problems buying these in store. Food quality and taste great, and can’t beat that price. Had to write something because of the reviews saying they were gross or moldy. Maybe depends on the store but I’ve bought from several different targets and always been good quality.
--------------------
Carrots are great for crockpot cooking
--------------------
I feel like I have to review these carrots because they seem to be getting such a bad rap. I buy a bag of these through Drive Up pretty often and although it seems a lot of people have had trouble with them they've always been great for me, thankfully. I'll definitely continue buying them!
--------------------
I received moldy carrots
--------------------
went bad within a day of opening. had to trash both bags. so disappointed.
--------------------
Fresh, tasty, crunchy, delicious
--------------------
Bag was open and the carrots were white and dry. Going right in the garbage.
--------------------
Difficult to chew and tasted like dirt.
--------------------
Once I opened the bag, less than 24 hours after I purchased the carrots, I could see that they were slimy & smelled disgusting. Can’t believe ‘fresh’ items aren’t quality checked. Waste of money. Gross!
--------------------
Same experience with the slimey spoiled carrots and well before the expiration date. Starting to think - Don’t bother with Good and Gather
--------------------
Slimy and spoiled. Terrible 3rd bad I have purchased and all 3 have been slimy and bad. Not expired either. Terrible quality. Don’t buy good to gather produce, it’s horrible.
--------------------
Perfect for carrot cake ♪(*^^)o
--------------------
Moldy carrot inside bag. Mistakes happen but I wish staff could check the items carefully before adding it. I saw it immediately while handling my grocery items at home.
--------------------
I'm growing way too sick and tired of expired items from the Sanford Super Target being pawned off on me ￼￼through the Shipt delivery service. Expired or nearly expired items should not be on shelves for our shoppers to put in the carts! The carrots weren't even in fresh liquid, it was disgusting bacterial slime! And this Good & Gather it's turning out to be a line of second right products, as the cheese is terrible, the vegetables are terrible, the fruit is terrible… Every single item is rated poorly here, so it's not just me. These carrots are no exception. I feel duped out of a yearly membership fee￼ that I thought would help us get fresh groceries during this time, but it's turning out to be quality worse than a food pantry!￼￼
--------------------
Love these, they're fresh, crunchy and already washed so it's a grab and go type of snack, I got mine and their expiration date was 20 days away and I got them in store not pickup or delivery. Overall delicious, sweet and would definitely recomend, but if you will buy them I would suggest physically get them in store and not get it for delivery or pickup, just so you could make sure that you get the freshest pack.
--------------------
Purchased these on a drive-up order.  Expiration date was 10 days in the future, and carrots tasted great.
--------------------
10/10 they are cut perfectly like name brand and tasted Delicious
--------------------
very good product, I buy it all the time and have never been disappointed.
--------------------
Expired on July 4th 2020
--------------------
I’ve tried buying this item multiple times and every time is a complete failure!  The most recent bag is the worst.  The expiration date is 12 days from today.  The unopened bag of carrots are swimming in slimy gross wet sludge.  The other bags I purchased were a similar experience.  Target used to carry a name brand, not their Good & Gather brand, and they were so much better!!
--------------------
Great product, quality and value for the money it’s also organic.
--------------------
Wrong price.  These were 50 percent off
--------------------
Delicious and fresh! Great quality and great price
--------------------
Used for chicken noodle soup! Made it super convenient and they were fresh and tasty! :)
--------------------
Very convenient and great tasting! Sometimes the ends are a little brown from being cut and then bagged. Not a problem here, I just cut it off and it’s good to go! Still saves a lot of time cutting it all up myself. Favorite snack to go along with hummus!
--------------------
I give these minus five stars .Awful.Rotted and brown and mushy on both ends. Disgusting. Why is Target selling these? Off brand do not buy. Waste of money . By the time you cut off all the rotted mushy ends there is barely any celery left. Not fresh.Will never buy again. Boo Target.
--------------------
As long as you check your produce closely and look at the best buy date, i think you can avoid bad produce. 3 stars though because Target needs to revise their grocery section to optimize. If you dont regularly shop there for produce, you may not know you need to be careful with the produce you buy. with that being said, the celery I purchased was great. But thats bc I know to be thorough before I buy their produce.
--------------------
I don’t know what it is but this celery is so much better than other celery I’ve eaten. Usually I have to cook it into something as it ends up being too tough to chew, but this one was perfect for just snacking on raw with some peanut butter. Yum.
--------------------
Delicious, convenient, and great price!
--------------------
These were rotten.  Boo.
--------------------
I absolutely love these carrots and go through a bag every week, great healthy option and no fuss. Great price too!
--------------------
Fresh & yummy !!!!!!!!!
--------------------
These carrots are always super fresh and taste great dipped in hummus.
--------------------
I love carrots and always try to buy organic with the skins on. These were the only option at Target so I had an open mind

They were wet and slimy in the bag. I had to scrub with a veggie brush to get the coating off. Gave me pause, as dampness in a sealed bag encourages bacteria growth.
 
Also peeled and gouged (see photo) wonder why peel; lots of vitamins in the skin.   

I probably won't buy again.
--------------------
Good flavor, none of the carrots were super wet or mushy. I would have preferred the package to be re-sealable.
--------------------
Couldn't tell the difference between organic and non-organic. They were nutritious and delicious. I like that they are made in the USA. They were fresh.
--------------------
A bit on the large side, so difficult to eat if you want to eat them raw. Otherwise, what can go wrong with organic carrots? I cooked them and they were very good!
--------------------
We buy baby carrots all the time and these are the right price and taste great. I like that Target works hard to bring healthy foods at good prices to its stores.
--------------------
Nice and crisp. Not water logged, in convenient size.
--------------------
These baby carrots are the truth. They are so rich with flavor and packed with a nice punch to keep you going. I love the size of them. They are perfect for on the go. My kids love them cause they are small enough to just pop in their mouth as a quick treat. The portion of bag is just great for my family. We snack on these for days.
--------------------
Convenient easy on the go snack or ready to use to put in stew or pot roast.
--------------------
Good, quality baby carrots!
--------------------
Fresh tasting! My daughter absolutely loves these. They are perfect for a middle of the day snack.
--------------------
I’m really surprised with these reviews, I have never had a bad bag! I’ve purchased numerous times, always sweet and snappy
--------------------
These weren't pleasant to eat. They were extremely stringy I couldn't even eat them without feeling like I was going to choke, even after cooking them. Definitely don't recommend
--------------------
This is horrible!!!! Too stringy and inedible! Do not buy! you have been warned! Clearly a waste of money.
--------------------
I have purchased these twice (thinking the first time was a fluke). These were rotting and slimy brown when I picked them up with drive up. Both times.
--------------------
These are crisp and reliably high-quality
--------------------
Absolutely delicious! Whole family loved them!
--------------------
These should not have been sold, they were completely inedible. They were slimy and going bad upon delivery,.
--------------------
Sugar snap peas are the only vegetable I eat -- I buy 3-4 large bags a week. Before the Good & Gather brand, Target stocked a stringless brand that came in a large bag with some purple coloring on the bag. Those peas were the best ever! Why can't Target bring those back? The G & G brand are OK but they are stringy and not as flavorful as the previous brand.
--------------------
Green shortly after purchase
--------------------
rotten and green. do not order for pickup. this is my 3rd bag of useless potatoes
--------------------
My local Targets don't carry this new Good and Gather product yet so I was thrilled to be able to find it recently at a Target in Birmingham, Alabama when I was visiting friends. The broccoli itself is organic and very fresh. We had a few raw broccoli florets with some ranch dip. We steamed the remainder of the broccoli to serve with chicken and biscuits and another side of mashed potatoes. I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review as a Target Hey, Bullseye reviewer. I just wish I could find this product in my local area. I recommend this organic broccoli to everyone who wants to eat their trees (ha). Also calling it "trees" gets your kids to eat more veggies!
--------------------
These were so easy for a busy night because they're already washed and cut, but not sure its worth the significant extra cost for use on a regular basis.
--------------------
Yummy! These are perfect for chicken, broccoli and cheese casserole. You can also just simply dip them in ranch dressing.
--------------------
The broccoli florets were very fresh and firm. They were great just eating out of the bag with dip. A nice bag and great crisp flavor. Not wilted at all but fresh as if you just got it out of the garden and cut them
--------------------
Convenient ready to use. Makes it easy to now make any recipe that requires broccoli and tastes great and fresh.
--------------------
These are just the same as if you bought a head of broccoli. As you would hope! You can actually get more in this pack than if you bought a head and chopped it up. I always put it in the same container and it was noticeably fuller with this bag over the head I had cut up last time. It's great if you meal prep a lot of food.
--------------------
Broccoli is great for everyone. We steamed these and added a little butter and cheese. yummy!!
--------------------
Convenient for salads or to steam. Don't need to take the extra time to cut up a whole head of broccoli.
--------------------
This is my go to spinach. The spinach is at a great price point compared to other brands and is always fresh. I put this straight in my freezer for smoothies and it never disappoints.
--------------------
Giving a 3 because it's always hit or miss for me with Target produce. Yoi have to look very carefully to make sure it's fresh and not a day from expiring. I can imagine there is so much wasted food because it seems they don't sell a lot of groceries. I think the store should be better aboit produce prices. Put them on sale when close to expiration.
--------------------
Good product to make dinner for a family with less price
--------------------
Not the freshest, but I guess that's what you get with delivery.
--------------------
I only eat organic. Had to throw it out. How do I get a refund?
--------------------
Very Fresh and Crisp! I've tried this spinach both Raw and Cooked! Works great for an earthy salad and or add it to some chicken, pasta, and cherry tomatoes for a quick effortless dish.
--------------------
This baby spinach didn't stand out from most other baby spinach available but it was fresh and delicious. I'd pick this out of the lineup.
--------------------
Amazingly fresh, although I did not keep it in the refrigerator for more than two days like I usually do. It also didn’t shrink down as much as other brands do once it’s cooked. I would certainly continue to buy this brand.
--------------------
Nothing to brag about but nothing to complain about either! The spinach was fresh and no bad leaves in the bag!
--------------------
I love how FRESH this baby spinach is! I love making spinach salad but sometimes the spinach can get slimy. This did not! It tasted fresh and I love it.
--------------------
I like the freshness of the spinach but there should be more added to the bag.
--------------------
These were fresh and delicious.
--------------------
Tasty spinach salad was what I ate for supper! Very fresh spinach with just the perfect crunch. I added some to an omelet for my husband. He loved it.
--------------------
Use it in my daily smoothie. Always good quality and always lasts. Sure, the occasional batch has a handful of wet/soft leaves by the end I toss, but it’s expected for this size if not used quickly. Never any mold issues or concerns. Container is also nice to rinse and reuse if I stop somewhere and get a bag so I can dump it in and not deal with securing an open bag for the next several days.
--------------------
Best deal on fresh organic that I can find. Using mostly for smoothies or as a side for dinner. Excellent organic spinach!
--------------------
Spinach was extremely wet and there was a large worm in it.
--------------------
I got food poisoning after eating this.
--------------------
This package was very fresh and lasted nearly 2 weeks.  I do hope that will be consistent.
--------------------
This is the second container I purchased a week before the stated best by date.  I use spinach in nearly every meal I make.  Rotten pieces throughout the container.  Good and Gather quality control is BAD!
--------------------
Large container, good for the price. I use spinach in everything I cook, I would buy from this brand again. They have some creative stuff in the food department.
--------------------
Great price point. Used for smoothie and kale salads. ￼￼ The only thing, which was not a terrible issue, there were more stem pieces then I would have preferred￼￼￼￼￼
--------------------
Really enjoy kale salads and the pieces in the past were tiny which made it difficult to eat. The last bag I purchased were not as finely chopped which I appreciated.
--------------------
While the package is large for what you pay, I found myself picking out several stalks mixed with the more edible leaves of kale. While the stalks can be eaten, they can be hard and bitter and I’ve read are not recommended for eating. Disappointed in the quality.
--------------------
I use this Kale for lunch salads and also as a garnish in soup dishes. even if you don't eat a lot of Kale, the bag lasts a long time. about 3 weeks until it becomes yellow or soggy.
--------------------
I was happy to find this at my local Target so that I did not have to make a special trip to the grocery store. I personally like how small it is chopped. I did have to sift through it to find big pieces of stem. I used it in soup so I can’t really speak to the individual taste compared to other kale I have bought. My soup turned out delicious though! So far I’ve been happy with all the good and gather products I have tried.
--------------------
This kale is finely chopped, making it great for smoothies. Always fresh and reasonably priced.
--------------------
Big fan of good and gather, this product just did not do the job. Many pieces of stem and sliced so thinly it goes through the colander. We eat a lot of kale but found this kale VERY bitter, even after massaging it. The packaging is also not at all recyclable or compostable.
--------------------
Very good stuff! Chopped very finely so not really suitable for kale chips. I love it though. I can’t eat a sandwich without some kale on it.
--------------------
Great bag of Kale. Just as clean and fresh as Taylor Farms. It seems like most bagged (triple washed) kale is dirty or I find bugs in it. I have purchased several bags of Good and Gather Kale and for the most part I've been pleased. There was a time or two that it could have been a little fresher, but thats on me. I could see through the bag that it was starting to wilt - but it was the last one.
--------------------
I love this kale for my salad every day. It's clean, nicely chopped up, and dry rather than wet which leads to bad odors.
--------------------
I love that this kale is chopped up small for my smoothies — I easily go through a bag a week. It’s also very reasonably priced. Recommend!
--------------------
Delicious!!!!! Omg love making kale salads with this product. This particular product is perfectly chopped and my absolutely favorite for side dishes and salad bowls. Would highly recommend! Organic or not it’s great quality. Only downside is the amount of stems found in the bottom of the bag. Wish this was reduced a bit.
--------------------
Excellent kale, and  very fresh, the only thing that’s missing is it’s not organic.
--------------------
I feel this is an excellent product. It seemed to be very fresh and prepared perfectly.  It seved as the ideal cut to lightly steam with meals. Very quick and nutritious.  The minus one star was because it was not organic, which might make it more perfect.
--------------------
If you want to use this for anything in which you don’t want the stems, this kale is not for you. It’s cut in such a way that removing the stems is time consuming. Makes it feel like there is just stem everywhere. But if you’re just having salad then this is probably fine. Great quantity for price.
--------------------
Not the freshest if picking up drive up.
--------------------
