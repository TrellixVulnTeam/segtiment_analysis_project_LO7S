Good price. Best brand for tuna.
--------------------
It’s so fresh and tasty
--------------------
My Husband is Very Please!!!
--------------------
Smell is awful, looks like shredded fish dumped in gross smelling water.
--------------------
I like the item, but only 3 of the 4 received were packed in water.
--------------------
Love this tuna, taste fresh all the time.
--------------------
love StarKist tuna it is the best
--------------------
Price and drive up pick ip
--------------------
This is my favorite canned tuna. 
I find it cheapest here at Target and am so happy that I can pick it up using the drive- up pick up option.
--------------------
good price for this brand
--------------------
This is the only tuna I purchase, most cheaper brands of tuna smells like cat food!!
--------------------
This works well in sandwiches or casseroles.
--------------------
Arrived can completely damaged, unable to reach customer service to complain. Can crushed on 4 out of 5.
--------------------
I love their Albacore tuna, it always tastes fresh and it's never chewy, like other non albacore versions. The tuna always has a nice color and it has nice big pieces not mushy shreads.
--------------------
Happy BB tuna was delivered. Thanks
--------------------
Cats both like it and it does seem to reduce hair balls.
--------------------
Sure, I think this product is an=mazing and I think my cats love it. But I was given a project on, and I need to know the two main sorces of protein which I assume would be Chicken and something else, but I ned the precent of the Energy protein and the other most used protein. Its something to do with the crude protein. Please help me with this.
--------------------
Best food for our indoor cats........love the curbside delivery.
--------------------
I'm giving it 5 stars because my cats like the old formula that didn't include turkey. I haven't given them the new stuff yet so I don't know if they'll like the turkey also.
--------------------
My cats have been eating, all Iams products for two years. They will NOT even try this one. They smell it and walk away. I believe it must be the turkey in it and they also, do not like big pieces of food. I'm really disappointed , for they are starting to gain too much weight and I was hoping this food would help.
--------------------
Quick and easy delivery. My older cats love Iams.
--------------------
My cat loves this food! It keeps him slim and trim and he’s active even though he’s inside a lot. I also started feeding it to my outside cat and I can definitely see a difference in his coat and eyes. Highly recommend and Target has the best price!
--------------------
I was feeding my cats a food that didn’t satisfy their hunger. On top of food I was buying treats. Now I switched to this iams and they are satisfied when they leave the dish. Treats are now on a rarity. I have happy cats now.
--------------------
My order was ready quickly. So happy to find this food at Target.
--------------------
My new cat loves this food so that makes me happy
--------------------
I got this for my long-haired cat who had just entered adulthood to try to control hairballs and manage her weight due to some knee problems that would require her to stay on the leaner/lighter side for her whole life. She's now about 16 months old, has never had a hairball and weighs just a little over 8 lbs, so I'm satisfied that this product works as described.
--------------------
This is the only food that my cats will eatAnd they love it! Why it keeps him healthy and controls there hairballs￼￼
--------------------
They love it and eat it all up
--------------------
My cat absolutely hates this food but it's the only low-cal dry foods I could actually find that's affordable. When he gets hungry enough, he usually sucks it up and eats it.
--------------------
I love to see my cat happy, he really likes it so much, thanks for making my bb happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
--------------------
Every cat  I have had will eat this and really like it. Makes feed time easy.  I have been using for years.
--------------------
Our two cats loved this dry food when it was labeled "with chicken". Now it seems turkey has been added to the ingredients and they WILL NOT EAT it! The bag looks the same except for two little words in the bottom right corner saying "& turkey" which we did not notice when we bought it. Please bring back the old formula and ditch the turkey!!!
--------------------
I love this kind of cat food and so does my cat Cena.
--------------------
We have two cats both with very long thick fur. Since using this we have noticed a vast improvement on fur balls. One cat is elderly and very heavy so this was purchased with her weight in mind also. In that way I can’t tell if it’s helped, but she’s not getting bigger.
--------------------
Ms Kitti has been eating the dry verity of this for the 3 years I have had her and we have had no issues. She won't touch wet food, human food or anything in between. What she was eating before I don't know as she is a rescue, but as a 15 year old Maine Coon she is thriving on Iams dry.
--------------------
This bag was actually given to me for free, so I figured, why not. After working long hours and coming home to see if they need more food, they don't touch it and look to me as a cruel handler planning their demise. Even mixing in other wet food, they will eat to get to the wet food and leave this in their bowl probably planning my demise
--------------------
My cat likes it though I don’t know how well it stops fur balls because he still throws up quite a bit. He’s got long hair though so it might decrease it
--------------------
All 3 of our cats love this food! We have tried other Iams and they didnt like it as much but this Indoor Health one is bowl clearing. Even our old picky man loves it.
--------------------
Bought this and found a chunk of mixture in it. Cat didn't want it.
--------------------
Been using Iam’s cat food forever!Every cat I have ever owned 30 years plus!
--------------------
Great, my cat loves it!
--------------------
My cats love it and they seem healthier
--------------------
I have feed my cats Iams for many years. They have thrived on it. Never any kidney or urinary problems.
--------------------
Have. Been feeding two months everybody doing great
--------------------
My cat was having some issues with hairballs so we decided to switch her food over to this. She absolutely loves it and hasn’t had any issues!
--------------------
Helped me with my cats to keep their gut healthy and plus great nutrition
--------------------
We do rescues and it really makes them healthy outside as well as inside ❤️❤️
--------------------
Cats really like it. I like to switch it up between other brands of hairball control
--------------------
This product has reduced the number of kitty hairball throwers so that is always a good thing
--------------------
Awesome! This food is a favorite for my kitties. And so glad Target supplies the big bags. Thank you Target. Will be purchasing this next month for kitties. Thank you
--------------------
I have been feeding this food to my cats for more than ten years.  They love it, it's easy to digest, and I have had no problems with it, nor have my kitties.  It is the ONLY feed my cats have, that and ice water in stainless steel bowl = happy kitties.
--------------------
I had a cat on Iams and I decided to get another cat and I switched them to Blue Buffalo. They were getting crystals every couple of months which they didn't get with Iams. So I switched back to Iams and they have not had any crystals since. .
--------------------
Has less % of protein than former brand which is what we needed for our cat and she seems to do well with it.
--------------------
My cats really live it and their seem to be fewer hair balls. It isn’t helping my chunky cat lose weight, but the others aren’t overweight.
--------------------
For 5 years, this was the only food my cat would eat. Then the formula changed from CHICKEN to Chicken, Turkey & Garden Greens. For the past several months, we have tried a variety of brands with very little success. Please bring back the original formula.
--------------------
My cats love this brand! We wouldn’t switch it ever. Their coat is shinier and they shed way less.
--------------------
It works great, the cat loves it, and the first 4 ingredients meet up to my standards
--------------------
Since my cat started eating this over other day, he has yet to have any issues with hairballs. He's happy, I'm happier.
--------------------
We adopted this kitty just a little over a year ago. She was quite chunky, so when we chose her initial kibble it was IAMS Proactive Health. She quickly took to the food and did quite well: Until we moved across the country. She then went on a four month hunger strike, then magically began eating again one evening. She first only wanted soft food with broth, then pate, and finally ... ONLY the IAMS. She hates that she doesn't get unlimited food every day, like I'm assuming her original family gave her, but she knows how to ration herself out over the course of the day to make it last as long as possible. The only thing I don't care for is all of the corn ... as other customers have mentioned ... and I'm not sure why IAMS hasn't addressed this and made a positive change. Corn is BAD for ALL of us - humans, dogs, cats. But for the Queen ... if she's eating and feeling great, I guess corn it is!
--------------------
My cat went from some very expensive food to this one, the price is great and she loves it.
--------------------
My cats love this dry food.  Their vet recommended it and I am so glad he did.  It helps the hairballs.
--------------------
Only type of food Ibuy.
--------------------
Iams is loved by both my cats! I was nervous about switching foods because cats can be picky! However, my cats love the natural favors in IAMS! I have a senior cat and a one year old. Both cats love the Proactive Health Indoor Weight & Hairball Care. It is worth the extra couple of dollars for the healthy benefits to your cats!
--------------------
Our two indoor cats have been dining on Iams dry cat food for the last 6 years. I feel that it is a good nutritious food for them and they seem to like it!
--------------------
I love it, my cat loves it!
--------------------
Might cost a little bit more than Purina One but it's worth it. My cats seem to have sensitive tummy's. I try to purchase the healthiest food for them within my budget. Iams is the only dry food that doesn't cause my kitties to vomit. They eat every last bit in their dishes whereas other brands they leave leftovers.
--------------------
When we adopted our kitty a few months ago, we started feeding her Nutrish’s indoor formula because it had the best ingredients for the money. However, I had to find a suitable replacement after she began a hunger strike. IAMS fit the bill. Although it was my second choice, it quickly became her first choice. She loves this kibble!
--------------------
I’ve been using this product for years, my cat loves it. She over licks as an anxiety technique. This food helps her control the vomiting.
--------------------
The best (seeming) alternative I’ve found to the more expensive brands. Maybe it’s just my cat, but I’ll say his litter box is much stinkier with this than some other more expensive brands
--------------------
My older cat has a very finicky stomach and has eaten Iams Proactive Health Weight & Hairball Care Dry Cat Food for quite a few years. Although he still has some bouts with his stomach , the problems are fewer and farther in between. My younger 2 cats have grown up on it and love it. It is so convenient to buy the large bag and have it delivered.
--------------------
The only dry cat food I use for my cats due to the hairball situation. Its not expensive and yet it is an excellent product.
--------------------
Our fur-baby Penny loves this stuff! We still get some hariballs, but I think it is mostly because DH doesn't brush her nearly enough now that we have baby-babies also.
--------------------
Good food, kitty enjoys it and eats it well. No issuses with hairballs since being on this food.
--------------------
As my cat grew older she started having issues with spitting up hair. I tried a few hairball treats, treatments and foods but never saw a change until using this. Not only did she stop throwing up hair she liked the food. Further proof that when the bag ran out I used her old dry food and she threw up within the first two days. Iams only now for her.
--------------------
My Girls Love it!! It is Healthy for them as well!!
--------------------
I'm really surprised at the negative reviews. I'm wondering if these people read labels. I read them very carefully because healthy food means healthy animals and less vet bills. Sometimes you have to sacrifice flavor for health. If you started out buying brands with all the yummy additives it will be tough to switch over. You will need to add little bits at a time to change over. I have had to do this with my dogs and horses! If IAMS is changing the ingredients hopefully it is to make a healthier food. My cat is happy, healthy and looks amazing. The only thing I question in this cat food is the corn. Is it good for them? I rescued my cat with intentions on giving her away, so she started on cheap food. No problems switching to this. She's been on it for 2 years now. She is active, happy and hilarious!
--------------------
IAMS must have changed their recipe as I've used this before - I tried to give it to 6 cats and none of them would eat it. I ended up donating it and wasting $30.
--------------------
We bought this item simply because we saw the ad. But it seems that our cat still prefers Hills. It is OK and worth price but we won't buy it again.
--------------------
I only buy this for my indoor cat. All the other indoor cat food I tried, my cat won't eat or gets sick. Iams is the best!
--------------------
Cats have eaten this product for years. The last 2 bags we have bought,my cats have to be starving before they will eat this junk. Whatever Iams has done with changing ingredents,they need to go back to the old product.If I could give negative stars, I would do that.
--------------------
this isn't their favorite food, and its not the best price. but as far as quality. it measures up. and the cats need to lose a little weight so this seems like a good choice
--------------------
I returned this product. It is Not what the picture shows. It is the new blend of chicken, turkey and greens that I did Not want. You need to update your pictures. The old blend of chicken, which your picture shows is what I wanted.
--------------------
I feed this to 9 cats. They love it, while it's expensive they have no digestive issues and I do have some that are more sensitive than others but no problems and even very little waste on this. Just healthy cats. I hope they don't change it.
--------------------
Boy, I have been running around town buying bags of cat food, hoping to find the old ingredients....got lucky once....I’ve tried to phase in the New with the old and having no luck getting our cat to eat it! Does anyone have an alternative???
--------------------
I've used Iams Indoor Weight and Hairball dry food with chicken for my cats for years. When I needed a new bag, I went to several stores but all the stores were out of it. Now I realize it isn't being produced any more. Very disappointing! I tried another brand with chicken as the main ingredient but they really don't like it.
--------------------
I bought this product as I have normally bought it for the 12 years I have had my cat. My cat will not eat it now as she evidently doesn't like the turkey ( in the CHICKEN) and garden greens in the redesigned cat food. Thanks for ruining my cat's food.
--------------------
My cats will not eat this new version, forcing me to look for another source other than IAMS.
--------------------
I have fed my cat the indoor Iams for 5 years. I did not realize that Iams changed the ingredients but my cat did immediately. Thought something was off when he would not eat it. I bought the biggest bag of Iams, because my cat had always loved this food. Definitely looking for food that my cat will eat!
--------------------
I love this food and so do my cats! It was recommended by my veterinarian as a good quality food without paying the high cost of prescription food.
--------------------
I have been buying the old product just chicken flavor for years. Did not realize they changed product. My cat is allergic to turkey that is why I need the old formula. Do not like the change. Now I have to find another product.
--------------------
I have not used the product. I use a vet recommended feeding system for my cat (excerciser food ball) and would love to use it with Iams food. The problem is that it only works with kibble of a certain shape and up to a certain size. I can't find any info on the bag or on the website to determine if this will work in my feeder. Would a pic on the bag really be so difficult? Other Iams foods I have used with my dogs have been great which is what I am basing my quality rankings on; my cat is missing out.
--------------------
I just bought this for my kids cats,they’re overweight , they love this food and I don’t have to go to the store. The store delivery to me. Thanks Target you guys are awesome
--------------------
Like many here, our cats have been eating Iams food exclusively for many years, then you changed the formula (without notice, Not Cool!) now our kitties wont touch it, and like others we will be looking to a new brand, your loss Iams.
--------------------
I ordered this because they show the old formula. I received the new formula, with turkey and greens, which my cats throw up immediately. Target needs to update this page. On the IAMS site, many people have written negative reviews of this formula. Even vets say cats don't need greens. Many of us have also called IAMS to tell them of the problems with this new formula. Now I have to return it and get the regular Hairball formula which is still chicken.
--------------------
Pet owners know it is not a good idea to suddenly change their pet's food. Any new food should be gradually introduced. So it seems irresponsible of Iams to change the recipe/formula of their cat food without noting this prominently on the bag. Plus, like many reviews I am reading, my cats don't like it at all. We've been using Iams for many years but now I guess we will have to find another brand my cats will eat.
--------------------
New formula not working Has Iams parent company changed?
--------------------
They changed the ingredients and didn't let consumers know. No where on the bag does it said now with turkey and veggies. Cat hated it. Very disappointed in IAMS. Get it together.
--------------------
We have been buying Iams proactive for Indoor weight and hairball control for over 5 years. I did not even realize that Iams had changed the formula until I noticed the two different color of kibble. My fat cats did not notice a difference either. They still scarf it down and beg to be fed twice a day. Thank you for a great product that keeps my kitties happy and healthy!
--------------------
We've been feeding our pets exclusively IAMS foods for decades. Our cat had been happily eating the chicken flavor of this food for years. IAMS recently reformulated it with turkey and veggies and our cat just meows, looks at his bowl and looks back at us. He will not eat this. Well, that's one way to control his weight, make the food unpalatable. We will be looking for a different cat food. So sad.
--------------------
As most know, cats a very finicky. My cats loved the chicken formula and we’re doing very well on it, but honestly they do not like the new chicken, turkey and greens.
--------------------
I bought a 16 # bag of this, not realizing they changed the formula from just chicken and added the turkey and garden greens. It even looks disgusting -and my two cats will not eat this product!! And now I am stuck with 15 1/2 #'s of useless cat food. I am trying different Iam's food- but am very disappointed Iams changed a product I trusted and my cats loved to this awful stuff.
--------------------
My 2 cats were doing great on the old formula and since I added the hairball treats, they were only occasionally
--------------------
My 17 year old cat has been eating this product for years. Now she will not eat it and my younger cat will not eat this any more!! I took it back to store and I see you added veggie. I talk to vet and cats do NOT need veggie. The vet helped me find new food close to old product so I switched to Hills.
--------------------
We have a new bag of Indoor Weight and Harirball and our cats weren't eating very much, so we checked the bag and it says it's made from chicken, turkey and VEGGIES. Since when do cats like veggies? Is this how you persuade them to not eat so much?
--------------------
I just bought a bag of this, and I swear last time I bought it, it was only the chicken recipe. Am I missing something? When did turkey and veggies arrive? I thought it was the same color bag, lol. Was there ever a chicken only flavor hairball adult cat food? I have no reason to give this a bad rating, so I will not. Just always gave chicken only because it’s supposes to be easiest on their tummies. Hopefully turkey is not different.
--------------------
Highly effective, very affordable and it lasts a long time
--------------------
I like the new subscription service you can get with Iams dry cat food. I can have it shipped to my home for free. The cat food is great - the cats have been on it for quite some time. Does well with controlling most hair balls. There are still an occasional one or two, but not as many before the cats went on this food. Also the weight control helps since the cats are getting older and do not exercise as much.
--------------------
This is the ONLY food I can feed my cats that doesn't have them throwing up, or having foul smelling poop in the litter box. It might sound weird, but they poop less too!
--------------------
I have seen a definite improvement with my cat’s issue with hair balls. He will be on this formula from now on.
--------------------
My two tabbies are 10 years old now and in great health. Their fur is still shiny and healthy looking too. They occasionally have a hair ball come up but not as frequent as without the prohealth I'm sure! They split a can of soft food twice a week and always have the Iams Weight and Hairball Control in the bowl when they want to eat. Their weight is good even though they eat when they want to. I'd recommend this to any cat person for their cat for sure.
--------------------
I'm very pleased with this product. I have two cats at two years of age and often have a third foster cat of mixed age. I have had no issues with hairballs or picky eating since using this brand. I love that is formulated for all the things I need and plan to repeat by! I especially enjoy the extra percentage I get off from Target when I get I use auto ship and it is much easier then remembering to go to the store every other month.
--------------------
I originally bought this for my overweight cat, but now I feed it to my other two (one who is a long-hair with hair ball issues,) They all like it.
--------------------
Quality product, cats like it! What could be better?
--------------------
Awesome that this can be delivered instead of me lugging it home from the store!! My cat loves it too!
--------------------
Cats seem to love it. I think it controls wt fine but hair balls do occur occasionally!
--------------------
Good taste. Easily stored
--------------------
This is such a good product. The tuna is always fresh, in water without losing the natural oil of the fish. It is a good size for an individual. Target has the BEST price around. WHen it goes on sale, I buy for me and for a donation to the local food bank.
--------------------
Perfect snack or meal, especially on the go.
--------------------
Honestly think its less tuna in the pouch vs the can but its more convenient
--------------------
Perfect for on the go or at home.  Unlike canned tuna, no draining needed.  With the right mix of ingredients, makes a delicious tuna salad just like Panera.  No matter how much I drained the canned tuna, could not get to the right consistence.
--------------------
My cats absolutely love this tuna and we love it too! Vet said it was ok to feed  it to them.
--------------------
Easy to open and no draining needed. Tastes delicious and moist straight from the pouch. Perfect for a snack on its own or to add to a salad for protein. Easy to take with me when I'm on the go.
--------------------
Starkist tuna fish and the price was right and would recommend
--------------------
My cat prefers not to eat the iams brand, he doesnt like the tuna but will eat some of the chicken
--------------------
My 9-month-old kitten loves the chicken and tuna flavors! The main issue is it is a very small portion. She eats her serving very quickly and wants 4-5 servings a day in addition to her dry food. Thus, it becomes expensive for me to have to buy a new package every other day.
--------------------
my cat liked it at first, but got tired of it by the end servings
--------------------
My cat has digestive issues and I’ve tried several grain free wet food and this brand has helped my cat not have a upset stomach. I’ve tried from crave to Rachel Ray and my cat prefers Iams brand.
--------------------
After doing an exhaustive search of wet cat food this was the winner for both of my cats which was the hardest challenge ever because one cat like some thing where the other didn’t but they both love this and can’t get enough.￼
--------------------
My cats absolutely love this wet food. I always add a little extra water to help keep my male cat hydrated, and they love it
--------------------
This is my older cat’s new favorite.
--------------------
My cat really likes this. Add it as a snack for her in between her diet foot meals to keep her happy and healthy.
--------------------
Dear IAMS, this is no replacement for the 3 ounce canned Purrfect Delicacies & Purrfect Grain Free Select Cuts (shredded texture) wet food in Chicken, Chicken & Beef, Chicken & Tuna, or Flaked Salmon & Tuna. The food is not the same - neither in texture nor in variety of proteins, and the plastic packaging is both inconvenient and bad for the environment. Please listen to your customers, and bring back either the Delicacies or Grain Free line. We and our kitties don’t want to switch brands, but you’re not leaving us much choice. Thank you, from your customers and their humans.
--------------------
Only cat food that our picky cat will eat!
--------------------
I wanted to feed my cat a pate soft food along with her Blue Buffalo, and after looking at the contents did decide on Iams Perfect Portions. They are just that; I bought the tuna/chicken. The portions are perfect, easy to store, and my cat loves both flavotrs.
--------------------
Cat will only eat pate with gravy.  He loves this stuff!
--------------------
My kitty girl loves this, in addition to the Iams kibble also. 1 side of this is 3--4 portions for her, with kibble, but she's small about 10lbs. It's getting harder & harder to find this, and find the different flavors. 
Please Target -- carry the salmon too!!
--------------------
My cat doesn't like regular can of wet food. She always leaves pretty much big portion behind and never touches it again. This small package is perfect for her. Like other said, the packaging is a little hard to open, but overall it's not a big deal.
--------------------
My cats love this cat food. Pros: Both cats have digestive issues but they are able to keep this food down. Smaller portions makes it easier to serve and not store. Cons: The lids on the container are very sharp. My husband and I are constantly cutting our hands when trying to peel it back.
--------------------
My cats normally prefer pate, so thought I'd try these individual servings, which really are about the amount they eat at one time. However, they eat all the other food and leave these on the plate. My one house cat and 3 ferals simply won't eat it.
--------------------
My 17 year old cat loves these portions! Sometimes they can be awkward to open, and liquid can spill on hands, but that's not an issue. Definitely recommend!
--------------------
Perfect sizing portion for my cat. He comes running when he hears his dinner bowl!
--------------------
Great pate my cats love it. Wish it came in a bigger can.
--------------------
Our cats love this food and I feel it is important for our 19 year old cat to have hte best nutrition possible. Thanks Iams!
--------------------
The food itself is great... our cats liked it...the packaging was tough to open and ackward getting liquid from food consistently on hands
--------------------
My cat loves this wet cat food and she is the perfect weight.
--------------------
I bought these when I ran out of the Iams 3oz cans I had been feeding my cat. I had tried this portion size from another brand, but my cat did not seem to care for that food very much. However she loves this stuff. Usually there is about 1/3 can left over with the 3oz size, but these portion sizes are just right for her. She eats all of her wet food and a small amount of her dry food. I'm happy this is available by subscription too!
--------------------
My cat loves these! I was feeding her the Iams Grain Free wet food cans but cans are a pain and not "perfectly portioned" like these are. I give her one per day as soon as I get home from work. She gobbles them right up!
--------------------
I love tuna and this tasted great on a cracker but there was no herb nor garlic flavor. Tasted pretty much the same as the plain one. I added some mayonaise for more creaminess
--------------------
Love this tuna pouch. Tastes great!
--------------------
i am addicted specifically to this brand of tuna packets. I don’t understand what they do to make it so tasty. I’ve even tried other tuna brands in acan but I just keep coming back to tuna packets!!!
--------------------
Delectable flavor and filling!
--------------------
My cat is particular about what she eats, but she loves Iams wet food. This product is a good value and it is affordable. I do not feed it to her often, and use it more as a special occasion food for her!
--------------------
My cat loves these! I give him dry food that’s out all day and then he gets one of these in the evening. He loves the consistency and gravy!
--------------------
I love that you can use each little cup of cat food as a portion control for your cat. My cat loves this cat food, and it's better for her because it's grain free.
--------------------
Nice size. Cat likes them
--------------------
When I got my kitten he was already eating Friskies as his wet food, but as he got older he became really picky and would not eat the “leftovers” from the 5oz can when they were served to him. So I switched him over to Blue Buffalo in the 3oz cans which he really enjoyed, but even with those he was never too fond of the chicken flavor in the 12 pack box. He eats Iams kitten formula as his dry food, which is chicken based, but for this he doesn’t seem to mind. Anyways long story short I decided to give these a go, they are a little smaller per portion being only 2.6oz, but other than that I have no complaints. My kitten loves that he only has salmon and tuna options now. My only concern now is I have to watch that he doesn’t eat it too fast and make himself sick, because he likes it so much. Oh, actually I do have a complaint... the foil lid is almost impossible to peel back without the gravy squirting out everywhere, but that is just a minor inconvenience.
--------------------
This is the only wet food my cats will have that is not Royal Canin.  I only wish IAMS would have a non fish recipe as indoor cats can have bladder issues if they only have fish based wet food.   A bit pricey
--------------------
This is the only food my cat will lick the bowl clean. I love that it is grain free and she loves the taste. I have been licked, nibbled, head bumped, stomped, trampled, and jumped on just to wake me up for breakfast.
--------------------
We have two adult cats that are required to eat grain free. We have tried every brand of grain free that’s out there and the only food they would eat and beg for was the Iams Purrfect in a can. We introduced them to your new plastic options and they walk away. Take one sniff and they don’t want a thing to do with it. Please bring back the original!
--------------------
My kitty was wasting a lot of her previous food because she wouldn't eat the meat chunks. I tried Iams and she ate almost every bit. I bought a small amount elsewhere and then ordered a larger quantity so I could pick it up at Target Drive Up. She is a very picky eater and has had some stressful times since I bought this but is beginning to enjoy it again. I agree that the only reason I bought at Target for the larger quantity was so that I could pick it up but I will continue to try the various types that are suitable for her.
--------------------
I was running out of Iams Purrfect Delights and to my dismay I could not find more. After a thorough search I find they have been discontinued. I tried all of the other Iams wet foods and had to go to other brands. I finely got them to eat one particular brand. The younger cat who stuck her nose up at it at first will now eat it, but the older one stopped. I am placing a portion of my last two cans of their favorite Iams Purrfect Delights into the new food to try to get the one to eat it again. I am not sure why the food was discontinued. Sales might have been better if it had not been so hard to find. I had to go to one particular store and maybe they had some in stock. I would usually order online from the store. I also appreciated the cans and that they were better for the environment. We still use Iams dry food.
--------------------
My cat has a sensitive stomach and so is picky about his food. His favorite wet food was discontinued and it has been hard to find a replacement. Maybe it's particular to him but this wet food has worked like a charm. I admit to also appreciating the convenience of the portioned packaging.
--------------------
My cats spent 4 years eating Royal Canin canned food (thin slices in gravy) then abruptly stopped. Now this is about the only food (and Sheba, same company)I am sure they'll eat (cuts).
--------------------
Geez, I hate to be the lone voice of positivity here, I was feeding my cat the Blue brand, he stopped eating it, then switched to this, and he loves it like no tomorrow! So far so good.
--------------------
My cats won't touch this new tubs bring back original cans
--------------------
I cannot believe that you phased out the grain free purrfect cans! The perfect portions are a perfect low quality, more expensive disaster! I completely agree with the previous review. I would like to add that a few years ago, my 15 year old cat all of a sudden refused to eat the brand I had used until then. This coincided with a developing kidney problem according to a blood test. I switched to iams purrfect grain free fish cans and a year later, the kidneys were fine as another blood test showed. Needless to say, my cat refuses to eat your perfect portions ... he knows when there is something fishy about the fish. So, you just lost a longtime customer!
--------------------
Dear IAMS, this is no replacement for the 3 ounce canned Purrfect Delicacies & Purrfect Grain Free Select Cuts (shredded texture) wet food in Chicken, Chicken & Beef, Chicken & Tuna, or Flaked Salmon & Tuna. The food is not the same - neither in texture nor in variety of proteins, and the plastic packaging is both inconvenient and bad for the environment. Please listen to your customers, and bring back either the Delicacies or Grain Free line. We and our kitties don’t want to switch brands, but you’re not leaving us much choice. Thank you, from your customers and their humans.
--------------------
I love the conveniently portioned plastic packaging and my cat loves the flavor, he never wastes a bite of it! I do wish there were more flavor options. I never have to waste food, like I had to with the cans.
--------------------
The cats just love this food.  One of them begs for it twice a day.
--------------------
My cats loved the original Grain Free in the little metal cans. I don't understand why IAMs would do away with it. I would buy it in bulk because the store I shopped would often be out of it so I would stock up whenever I could. My two cats were happy, healthy, shiny coat, no up-chuck when they ate the original. They walk away from this and all other flavors. Plus why the plastic containers? Plastic is unhealthy and, now days, hard to recycle.
--------------------
My cat loved the Iams Purrfect Delights flaked seafood variety cans.  Since they seem to have been discontinued I wanted to find something similar since she is obsessed with seafood wet food.  The indoor perfect portions salmon and tuna combo pack did not disappoint!  She actually eats all of her food now (one half of the 2-pack) instead of leaving half in the bowl.  Not sure why other people's cats are so super picky, but my 3 year old kitty loves this food!!
--------------------
My cats love the original IAMS wet grain-free cat food that came in small cans. Have tried all flavors of Perfect Portions. They both take a one smell and walk away without even tasting. Please get rid of Perfect portions and bring back the cat food you had in small cans.
--------------------
My cats won't even look at this new replacement for the original flaked tuna & salmon in gravy. Why mess up a good thing??? Now I have to throw out a million cans of cat food to try and find one my cats will eat. Bad move IAMS...MARS...whoever is making these poor decisions.
--------------------
Generally I love tuna, this particular one was a bit too much on lemon flavor side. The tuna itself was great, not greasy and not too salty just a bit too much lemon flavoring for me and my kids. I you love lemon - you will enjoy it.
--------------------
This flavor is kinda gross, but it's okay for a quick lunch on the go.
--------------------
too Salty.Salt should be left to the customer to add
--------------------
Perfect lunch when you want something quick. You can eat with saltines throw on a salad. Effortless and they taste great. Lemon pepper is my fave.
--------------------
Exactly what I was looking for. Everyone loves them
--------------------
Love this "flavor" of tuna! Always stuck with just the plain tuna, concerned I would find one of the seasoned version would taste strange. Love the lemon pepper option! These packets are awesome and great for on the go. I usually buy these for lunch when I don't like meal prepping for a week. This size is filling if you add crackers into the mix, although I might recommend the larger version if it's all you're eating.
--------------------
The Money tuna pouch. Best in the bunch.
--------------------
excellent source of omega 3. great price too.
--------------------
my cat loves this food
--------------------
I have fed my cats only Iams. Iams is the best cat food. It is very high quality and they love it.
--------------------
I have three cats and all of them love this product!
--------------------
Stevie was adopted at 6months old, and is now at a year and a half. We have fed him IAMS healthy adult ever since we brought him home. He is an amazingly health, energetic young man, and we just wanted to say thanks to you all!
--------------------
My cats love this food, package came damaged (ripped and taped). I immediately called customer service and rrported it. Replacement was sent and received in 2 days. Awesome
--------------------
My cat loves it and it’s easy to diggest
--------------------
I love this kind of cat food and so does my cat Cena.
--------------------
This is the healthiest cat food and I have 3 cats so I love this large size. It is very convenient.
--------------------
My cat had been eating Hills Science Diet during and after I adopted her...she loved it. Problem was my local market doesn't carry Hills products so I grabbed a bag of your Proactive Health and now she doesn't want to eat the Hills brand. The problem I have is that it's very hard to open the stupid bag...never seen another pet food bag that was so badly designed. I'm afraid she is going to be forced to eat the Hills Science Diet in the future.
--------------------
My cat loves this dry food. The seven pound size is convenient and at a good price.
--------------------
my only cat food. The orange bag. Always have it on hand.
--------------------
My cats actually like this hair ball reducing food!
--------------------
I've been buying this cat food for years and my cats love it----even the homeless cats that come and eat!
--------------------
My cats love this food it’s a good value plus good for them
--------------------
We are currently feeding a stray cat in our neighborhood your high quality food (we are considering adopting her), and she loves your product. She doesn't care that the bag opening/closure is awkward, but we, her three adult caregivers, think you need to redesign the bag because it is difficult to make a V to ensure all the pieces flow out instead of scattering. Once the bag is opened we fold it several times and use a clip to keep it fresh. We will continue to purchase your quality food but please consider my suggestion.
--------------------
It’s the only food my cat can eat.
--------------------
Iams is one cat food my cats love. they eat it every day. taste great. great price
--------------------
I have been buying Iams for years! Lately the food is so much better with different, flatter pieces. My cats like it so much better and they don't throw it up whole. I have rescued cats for years and the prices of Iams has gotten higher and higher. It is so expensive that I'm going back to Friskies. I'm 81, I can't afford it any more! Bring DOWN the prices!!! There are never any coupons! Sorry!
--------------------
Iams cat food is the brand we feed our cats and being able to order it while I am out of town so that my daughter could pick it up makes my life so much easier. My daughter is a college student with a job so she has little free time and using Target’s buy & pick up service is fantastic.
--------------------
Everyone of My Cats Love this Food! And its Good for them too!
--------------------
Years ago,I had a golden persian.I was told 2feed him Iams bc it wont stick 2his butt-hairs.(true indeed)For 13yrs he only ate Iams (it was an orange bag, wasn't as many choices back then & was only sold @vets) &wet on occasions. A huge point was when I had2take him2 vet 4an abcess, @follow-up,his vet commented on how fast his hair grew back.Im glad I chose Iams! I now have a new calico kitten, and starting her on Iams kitten.
--------------------
My cat likes it better than most dry cat foods.
--------------------
I have 2 adult cats, over 10 years old.  After trying all kinds of dry foods, they both like this one obviously. It seems to be helping their good health, too.
--------------------
I have been using this for over 20 years and my current male and female cats, both around 4 years old have ONLY eaten this food and have ALWAYS LOVED it. Now after buying over 6 different bags from 5 different stores I am convinced you guys have changed the formula. They REFUSE to eat it. I don't know what to do. I've been buying awful cheap stuff that they tolerate but they don't eat it like they used to eat this food. ALL my cats have always loved this iAms and NO OTHER flavor works. PLEASE PLEASE HELP
--------------------
My cats love this food and I love that it doesn't upset their tummies
--------------------
Excellent cat food. Highly recommend it!
--------------------
Cats have been on it for 20 years now. Never a problem.
--------------------
This is a great value 22lbs Bag of Iams Healthy Adult dry cat food, delivered right to your door free if you have a red card. Target is the best!
--------------------
We've used it for years
--------------------
I feed my 3 cats this and they all absolutely love it! Shiny coats, happy tummies, regular you knows. I have a variety of cats as well, male and female (both fixed) a little over 1 year and then a 6 month kitten. This food is what we get for them plus the wet pate when I can find it, only down side otherwise they would be fed both on a regular basis. Made the mistake of buying "meow mix" when i was too broke and i noticed a huge difference in only 3 days, as soon as i opened the bag all 3 meowed in delight. I highly recommend this if you plan to stick to one kind of food for your cat and can meet the cost.
--------------------
The box it came in was a good idea of helping to keep the food intact upon delivery!! Everything was perfect!!
--------------------
My cats love Ian’s dry food. They have healthy, shiny coats best of all, good health.
--------------------
Francis really likes Iams Cat Food. It really does make me feel good to be giving him something that he want, and that is good for him. He is very active, and this food is helping him stay that way.
--------------------
This is the only dry food that my cat will eat and she does it with gusto.
--------------------
Good quality cat food. My cat loves it. This size is the most cost effective.
--------------------
I had to throw it out because the bag exploded inside the box and alot of the food felt wet
--------------------
Only cat food my cats like. Doesn’t smell up the house or attract ants either. Great price from Target and enjoyed the free shipping.
--------------------
My cats are eating it, and that's usually hard to get them to do with more healthy dry food. So I'm happy!
--------------------
Great stuff! More expensive than other comparable foods but what are you gonna do.....?
--------------------
Our kitty enjoys iams
--------------------
Good that my cats like Iams and it's a nutritional option on the shelves ... but I would suggest slowly integrating into their diet in small portions .. just like any new foods .. great price as usual with the big red :-)
--------------------
Why would you change a cat food formula? It is very hard to switch a cat to new food. Now he won't eat this.
--------------------
my cat loves IAMS more than any other cat food kind. out of all cat food kinds she likes this one the best! p.s her name is Britney.
--------------------
My cat wants the Orginal food back, I bought her this and she wont eat it, even after mixing the orginal with it.
--------------------
Love this product. I used to work for the company and I know how good the food is My cat’s hair cost is so shiny, they love the food & there’s less output Because they absorb more highly recommend
--------------------
Tastes great!!! Ideal if you’re looking to maintain a healthy weight!
--------------------
My go to. Great value.
--------------------
When we adopted our cat she had been fed strictly Iams Cat Food, so we continued feeding her this product. She has really thrived by eating Iams ProActive Healthy Adult Cat Food. She loves it!
--------------------
I have been buying Iams since the dog food looked like potting soil. I was breeder/dealer when that was the only way it was distributed. I have produced both both champion dogs and champion cats over the past 35 plus yeats. I have had cats that lived into their 20's. When I was raising and showing dogs I was a dealer until I could talk a local feed store into carrying it. Here is my current problem, you keep changing the bag size and now purchasing the original chicken cat food seems to be becoming a bigger and bigger problem. Sizes of the larger bags of dry original have changed sever times over the past few years and now the size of 16 lbs seemed totally unavailable. You are forcing me to research other brands to find a company who does provide larger size because with seven elderly cats I cannot afford your little bags. My other problem is my cats won't eat anything but dry original chicken Iams. Suffice it to say I am extremely disappointed in your current direction. I cannot tell you how many people I have started on your dog and cat products. A DISSAPOINTED ANGRY CUSTOMER Here
--------------------
Great price this is the only cat food my cat will eat
--------------------
My cat loves this product.
--------------------
I had the opportunity to try these biscuits and I lost say I have been converted. My cat loves the taste and seemed to have more energy after eating these . He's fur has become more shiny and softer . I would recommend it to all cat owners xx
--------------------
My cat Sparkle loves this food.. she runs on a morning to her bowl.. she is very healthy and happy.
--------------------
Our cats have lived exclusively on IAMS dry food since they were small kittens. Although one of them died last year, the cause was most likely a cancer and not related to nutrition, according to our vet. We think that the cats ate normal amounts and maintained good weight balances. We fed them twice a day, usually they left just a few crumbs in their dish. We've used each age range as they grew older. Our Vet suggests "Science Diet" or a proprietary food his clinic handles, but the IAMS varieties have worked fine for us.
--------------------
I've tried several times, but they go up and sniff the bowls, maybe even take one bite or two, then walk away. I always leave 2 bowls of dry kibble for them during the day when I'm at work. With their favorite brands, the bowls are empty by the time I come home. With the Iams, the bowls are left untouched when I get home and they cry at me for something to eat. I'm sure some cats like this product, but mine don't.
--------------------
My kitten Snoooy has being eating this since kitten he is now 1 years old. He's happy healthy and love these cookies
--------------------
This is the ONLY cat food we will buy. Our cats have been on this food for years. No problems and no hairballs.
--------------------
IAMS Proactive Healthy Adult Original with chicken is tasty. Kitty and Frankie love eating it. Great price. Use the target app to order the IAMS cat food. Home delivery and subscription save 5%. You can have recurring delivery. Month after month.
--------------------
My cats seem to love this food. I had a problem with my cats having gas and bad breath and occasionally vomiting. Since switching to this those problems has disappeared. Their coats are silly smooth they are healthy and vibrant. Would recommend this to any other cat lover.
--------------------
I've been buying another brand of food for some time but ordered this because it sounded like the ingredients were better. It even smells better and my cats love it.
--------------------
We fed this product to our cat Jasper. She lived 19 years. I would say this is a testament to the quality of the product. Our new additions, Chessie & Charlie have been eating the Kitten Formula, and now that they are a year old we are transitioning to this. Looking forward to enjoying Chessie & Charlie for a good long time!
--------------------
We have always bought IAMS, but our cat won't eat the new bag. Usually, she attacks the new bag, but now she won't even touch the new food. She hasn't eaten for three days. May need to purchase a different brand.
--------------------
My cat loves to eat but unfortunately the food does love her. She was constantly vomiting and since she started eating the vomiting has completly stopped. She is full of energy and meows loudly for her Iams!
--------------------
Josie's been on IAMS for 4 yrs, I've always had excellent luck with IAMS products they come highly recommend by my vet of 30 yrs. No hairballs no digestive no problems!
--------------------
My sweet kitty Dori was getting sick all the time. She had urinary tract infections, a blood infection, etc. She lost over a third of her body weight. After being on a special prescribed diet and improving her health some, we put her on this food in the hopes that she would continue improving and that it would strengthen her immunity. I'm happy to say she has not been sick in over a year. She gained all her weight back. She's energetic and playful again! I've got my sweet girl back and I truly believe that this food is keeping her well.
--------------------
My cat loves this brand he's very picky. Its also very healthy he gets complemented all the time. Daddy's little stud.
--------------------
iams is not as good it has been and I think its getting worse then getting better
--------------------
I have a foster cat who came to me with horrible skin problems, flea bites, dull coat and generally unwell. He is massive at 17 lbs, possibly some main coon and he is poly dactyl. Iams food has changed his skin and coat. After a visit to the vet and strict instructions to feed Iams, Ernest is a new cat! He is playful and feels so much better. "time for your Iams" gets him running to his food bowl every time. He is vastly different now and with seven toes on each front paw, is capable of some major cat releated destruction.
--------------------
Feral cats love it, what they don't eat opossums eat. Any left raccoons take care of. Raccoons don't get enough they take off lid and throw both lid and container say its a hit!!
--------------------
Ever since I was adopted by my American shorthair boy Marty, I've been concerned with feeding him a healthy diet. We tried the very expensive, exotic stuff from the pet store, because it was said to be very healthy. Well, Marty reacted to it about as well as I do tofu, which is also said to be very healthy - he wouldn't eat it. IAMS Original saved the day - Marty eats a healthy amount of it, without over-eating. When I call "Supper!" he RUNS to his bowl. His coat is great and his energy superb. IAMS costs a bit more than the other brands in my local store, but I feel the added cost is worth it, since Marty likes it and obviously has good muscle tone and a normal weight.
--------------------
Our cats love Iams! Have used it over a year! They love the taste!
--------------------
I am disappointed with the inconsistent quality of this cat food. Have been buying it since 2002 and the product (and ownership) has changed. The kibble used to be more triangularly shaped and harder. Latest product is soft and my cat's reaction is to throw pieces out of the bowl and not eat the broken down pieces in the bowl. Considering trying another brand.
--------------------
This is my cats' favorite food. This was a great deal for the size.
--------------------
I have fed my cats Iams Original for many years. They have yet to tire of the flavor and I believe Iams is the best food for my cats health and well being.
--------------------
My cat is very picky, so it's nice to find food he will eat, that's good for him.
--------------------
I used to purchase a few different cat foods for our cats, depending what was on sale, what I had a coupon for, and what I could get cheapest...only selecting from what I felt was top brand cat food (basically all the cat foods you will see Iams list on their comparison list). I thought they were all the same. Then, my daughter decided she wanted to shave our midlength coat, black bombay cat. This gave me an idea to see if we could visually see a difference if we stuck with solely Iams cat food while she regrew her hair. As her coat regrew, we noticed a difference quickly. She's always been a gorgeous cat, but now her coat is so glossy and even more silky. Her trouble with hairballs also cut down tremendously from many times a week to rarely ever, and her hair has been fully grown back to its original length for at least a year. I have refused to buy any other brand since, not only for the cats, but for our dog as well. If it makes that much of a difference in their coats, I can only imagine the difference it makes on their entire bodies.

We have had our only cat for 5 1/2 years now. Our vet recommended Iams on the first visit. I have experimented once with another brand. Never again. He actually tries to leave the other brand in the bowl or flings it out piece by piece. If Leo could write a review, I'm sure he would say Iams 5 Stars! I have tried, I mean HE, has tried the Hairball formula, but he identifies with the Original. The Vet office labeled Leo as American Domestic Medium Hair, but we think he favors a runt Maine Coon or Norwegian Forest. So, there's some fur. He found us as a stray. As Leo ages, we may need to revisit the Hairball Formula. But I doubt we will try another brand. It's more important to see him enjoy the food in his bowl. And that's what it's all about, being honorable stewards to our pets.

2 of my cats really liked the food and I am still giving it to them, but 1 of them did not like it at all and would barely touch it. I had to give her her old food, and she will not eat it ever since, she never ever barely tried it but will not. I do not know why. The other 2 seem to really enjoy it though so I am happy about that [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My cat is a picky eater. I tend to want to try new brands with her so I was happy when Iams sent a free bag to try. I have never tried any Iams brand before. The bag sat for a couple days unopened as I had just purchased a new bag of her food. She tore the bag open with food already in her bowl of her other brand. I was worried she would get sick but did not. She seems to enjoy this food more than other dry foods. I also like that I can get Iams at stores other than pet stores which saves time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have three cats and they all have enjoyed the transition to Iams. They seem to really like the taste and since I switched gradually they didn't have any stomach issues. I like that its made with chicken and seems to be helping their coats. The texture seemed similar to their last food and they just seem very happy overall with their new food.

My cat has always been a picky eater and often when eating a dry food it did not seem to agree with her. Since starting the Iams cat food she has been eating well with no upset stomach. She has been more playful and very content. She asks for it on the morning and quickly starts eating. We will definitely be using Iams for her. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have been very impressed with Iam's Adult with Chicken cat food, and it really takes a lot for a dry cat food to impress me , and even harder for it to impress my cat, Mudvayne ( yes, names after the band ). Normally , I have to mix a high end wet food with any dry food that I give him, and if I am lucky, he will eat the wet food , maybe some of the dry food. Sometimes he just licks the wet food off of the dry food leaving the dry food behind. So imagine my surprise when I gave him a scoop of the Iams Adult with Chicken, that I received compliments of BzzAgent, straight out of the bag, no wet food added and he began to gobble it right up without any finicky hesitation at all! I was in complete shock that a cat food that was packed with all of nutrients he needs also appealed to his super picky taste buds. I would definitely recommend Iams Adult with Chicken to anyone with a a super persnickety feline in their life, that not only wants a food that their furry love will find super yummy, but will also help keep their fur baby's diet packed with all of the nutrients he/she needs as well. Iams Adult with Chicken will definitely be becoming a staple in our pet food pantry and I would venture a guess that it will become a staple in anyone else's who gives it a try :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Our cat easily made the transition to Iams. It didn't take much mixing and she was happily eating it within a weeks time. She is happy, at a healthy weight, and has a shiny coat.

Our cat easily made the transition to Iams. It didn't take much mixing and she was happily eating it within a weeks time. She is happy, at a healthy weight, and has a shiny coat.

My cat has always been a bit of a picky eater. We have tried several brands and she doesn't always like what I bring home. This was one of the few she actually seems to like! It took her a couple days to warm up to something different than her usual but after that she had no problems. I like that Iams is a well respected, high rated brand. That I know she will be eating a high quality food! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I usually roll my eyes at the high-priced "quality" pet foods but, ever since Tucker, Olifur, and Parker made the switch, I roll no more! The royal triumvirate really took a liking to this food right away. We followed a progressive path until total switcheroo. At no point did I see change in eating or litter pan habits. Iams is definitely a trusted name, and this product makes claims that our kitts will be healthier. The only reason to pick something else is cost, right? I feel the same way. After Iams gave the boys and I a bag to try for free, and seeing their pleasure, the small increase is negligible. I recommend you try this meow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I'm now on my second bag of Iams Proactive Health for my cat. He never needed the transition, which really surprised me, and has been loving it since the first scoop. I know because it is an Iams product that it is healthy and well balanced and I appreciate the fiber blend which seems to have reduced some of his digestive issues.Porter is normally a picky eater (I don't know how many other brands I have thrown out), but he loves the chicken flavor of this formula. I like that the formula is designed to help him burn fat and give his metabolism a boost and he seems to be actually eating more evenly throughout the day instead of bolting down half a bowl as soon as it is filled. As I mentioned, we are now on his second bag and I am very satisfied with it. Iams Proactive Health Original Blend is definitely a winner in Porter's book.

This is my favorite tuna, happy I could get it from Target.
--------------------
Great product. Light white tuna
--------------------
The only think I don’t like about this tuna/yellowfin is the baking in tin method means it takes a lot of scrubbing to get the can clean for recycling. As far as the tuna goes, I can’t see what’s not to like, when the brands we grew up with are now putting out cans of water with bits of fish, this is solid tuna, one piece nearly the size of the can. I see one reviewer thought that was disgusting, I guess they thought a can of tuna is supposed to be mostly water!!!
--------------------
Best ever. Taste is incredible.
--------------------
I've tried different brands of albacore tuna and this is by far the best one. Makes delicious tuna sandwiches and salads. Wild caught and salt-free, too....a winner! Pricier than other brands, but it is worth it.
--------------------
We have been buying this tuna for years. It is tasty and totally blows away the canned tuna you find in grocery stores. It comes with salt or no salt, your choice. Try this: you will be hooked.
--------------------
This is my favorite tuna. Since I have a hard time finding it in stores I order it online. This is high-quality tuna, It's like a solid tuna steak in the can with very little water. I love that it is available without salt.
--------------------
Pricy, but the best tuna I've every had!
--------------------
Gross! Was like solid light tuna - cat food quality. Will not buy again.
--------------------
We have enjoyed Wild Planet products for several years. We are health conscious and trust this company and its products. No added salt to this tuna; like that!
--------------------
Wild Planet has the best tuna and salmon on the market. Highly recommend.
--------------------
As we already know the great taste and quality of this tuna (we've ordered in the past, elsewhere), we were impressed with the way they were packaged. We ordered a dozen cans of tuna and every can was bubble-wrapped. Not one dented can.
--------------------
Really like using this tuna since it's wild and a safe fish to eat!
--------------------
This is the best canned Tuna we have ever tried and we love the quality. The can is packed with solid Tuna so it goes a lot further than other brands in the same size can. Would highly recommend it just for taste but for my family I also think it the healthiest.
--------------------
Wild Planet tuna is absolutely the best canned tuna there is. It is hard to not just eat it from the can instead of using it for sandwiches or whatever dish I want to prepare. No more sandpaper in water tuna for me as I've permanently switched to Wild Planet. I've told many people about it and while it is available at a local store (but less expensive at Swanson), I prefer to order 10 at a time to have on hand always.
--------------------
This tuna is high quality. It is delicious. I bought just six cans but now I'm going to order a minimum of 12. This tuna cannot compare to anything on the grocery shelf!
--------------------
I hesitate to eat much albacore tuna anymore due to mercury contamination, but this is low-mercury and even fits into my low-sodium diet, so I'm glad that Swanson carries it!
--------------------
Solid chunk of tuna and not just flakes filled with water. Best tuna ever.
--------------------
Low mercury is the way to go. My body feels so much better just knowing that I am ingesting the least amount of mercury possible in a product I love. In addition I enjoy the convenience of having it delivered right to my door for an unbeatable price. Thank you Swanson Vitamins for carrying this as well as many other great products.
--------------------
The only tuna that I have found to give me the omega health benefits that I am looking for. The fat is not removed like what one would get in the grocery store, so the omega's remain.
--------------------
Can’t even review the taste because all of my cans that were ordered have major dents in them.
--------------------
These reduced sodium tuna packets are one of my favorite easy snacks. So much protein and the flavor is great!
--------------------
I personally love these single serving size packets.
--------------------
If you can avoid it because you don't have a sodium problem I would avoid this. It's very bland. I was very disappointed when I tried this with a tuna fish sandwich.
--------------------
Quick easy snack/lunch - great value! They use to have a mint in them, but they must of have done a way with them recently.
--------------------
I love this tuna pack and gave it 5 stars but it keeps defaulting to less stars
--------------------
You could make the same thing at home for less but it's a very convenient, small kit. I work at a desk and keep a few of them for when I want a snack. It's the perfect amount for a snack or lunch if you're a light eater. Also, the mints are way good.
--------------------
Okay so at about $1.70/ea. these kits are pricey for their food content. But the convenience can't be beat. It's basically a Starkist tuna in water envelope, a packet of relish a packet of mayo and a 6 pack of wrapped crackers. Also included is a fork, napkin and a mint. If you are chained to a desk this is a fancy little snack all inclusive of the materials needed to clean yourself up after eating a tuna lunch. I bought 2 of these and when I couldn't find another one a week later settled for just a plain packet of Starkist Albacore in water and it simply wasn't the same. Now the only way I can eat tune is in these fancy kits!
--------------------
Good name brand tuna. tasty
--------------------
great flavor, decent sustainability policies
--------------------
Great canned tuna. Been buying this for years.
--------------------
I was looking for tuna for my cat who is allergic to everything. I expected "chunks" but got water and shredded bits of tuna. My cat ate it the first night, turned up his nose after that. We returned the other cans.
--------------------
How disappointing to open a can that is supposed to be chunk tuna and find nothing but water with a little bit of shredded tuna and I wouldn't know what it was if the can hadn't said tuna. Will not buy again!
--------------------
Great quick lunch if you’re on the go
--------------------
Tastes fine. I use these for backpacking and camping! It's a great size to supplement my hiking lunches, super lightweight, good calories & salt content. The packaging is wasteful, I would never use this instead of making from scratch at home.
--------------------
The flavor was kind of bland. There were no extra herbs, spices, or ingredients, to make this salad any more flavorful than just adding mayo to a can of tuna. However, it is much easier and quicker to just scoop the packet onto the bread without having to mix it. This made one fully stuffed sandwich.
--------------------
the consistency was a little weird and I do not like sweet relish in my tuna salad.
--------------------
This packet can actually make 2 nice sized sandwiches, especially if you like to add lettuce, and other veggies on the sandwich. The flavor is very good, not too mild and yet not spicy. I use these for canoe trips all the time in the Boundary Waters. Packaging is wilderness friendly/legal and is a nice lunch meal.
--------------------
These are great snacks. I do wish they sold the canned tuna salad separate though in case we don't want the crackers. Please note the separate nutrition facts on the back. Those crackers really up the nutrition info!
--------------------
My granddaughter loves her tuna and crackers￼
--------------------
Great for on the go. I love to take these kits for lunch ( I only have 30 min). I’m a big tuna fan. There is pieces of pickle added to the tuna salad. Yummy!!
--------------------
Awesome taste, relatively healthy, convenient, great value. I buy out the whole shelf of these every time I go to Target, but it seems like the last few trips they’ve been running low or were out. Please keep these beauties stocked!
--------------------
Great for quick snacks on the go or when I am just too lazy to fix anything else for a snack & want something quick at home. Crackers and the tuna salad are very good.
--------------------
it was already mixed, not dry, lots of different flavor, crackers are perfect.
--------------------
Anytime I order food from target it gets to me in really bad shape. Cans dented, crackers broken, labels faded, and etc. I think they send it out that way and have no quality control.
--------------------
okay for a snack for a very busy day when you have no time for lunch
--------------------
Just tuna with green and red hot peppers.  No mayo, relish, or crackers.  (I added some Wheat Thins).  It was spicy-hot but not too hot, just right.  So much flavor!  I'm definitely ordering more!
--------------------
Great! Perfect amount of heat on the jalapeños.
--------------------
It's good, I wish it were a bit spicier though. Goes great with tortilla chips and sour cream!
--------------------
I love this spicy flavor Jalapeno!!! It's our new family favorite! It's not too spicy, just enough for a little kick.
--------------------
I am obsessed. It has the perfect amount of flavor, texture and spice. A true win if you like jalapeños. I add it to my salads or eat it on toasted sprouted bread. Yum
--------------------
It didn't have much of a ranch taste, and also kinda tasted off. I just added extra pickles to make up for the weird taste.
--------------------
I love the Ranch brand of this packaged tuna. You don’t have to add anything to it to make a tuna sandwich. I do add shredded mozzarella cheese or cheddar cheese mix it all up put, it on bread and make a great grilled tuna sandwich with it.￼
--------------------
My favorite tuna pouch so far. Easy to open and tastes great. It's not overly ranch tasting but has a nice flavor. I like to eat it on its own for lunch or as a snack. Helps curb my cravings.
--------------------
Taste was okay. Ranch flavor was very lite. It was a little bit sour. I mixed it with a regular can of tuna and added mayonnaise and pepper to make it more palatable and flavorful.
--------------------
My new favorite flavor. These are good and convenient.
--------------------
Love this flavor!! I can't wait to make tuna cakes with these!
--------------------
I really liked it.  Its easy and very good. Great for lunch during the work week. Buying more.
--------------------
So flavorful. The texture is a little too smooth for my preference but the taste is great. I mix it with a little bit of blue cheese and mix it through a chopped salad for lunch- no dressing needed !
--------------------
Good stuff directly out package. Highly recommend.
--------------------
I really enjoyed this straight out of the pouch. I eat tuna regularly and try not to use mayo if I don’t need to. Often I’ll add Dijon mustard to plain tuna but until today had never tried these flavored pouches. I only bought the one I ate, so now I’m online ordering more.
--------------------
We keep a lot of these tuna packets on hand for quick snacks, to keep in a drawer at work, and for on the go for a low calorie, high protein snack. The sweet and spicy is a favorite. It’s pretty mildly spicy but still nice flavor.
--------------------
I take it in my lunch and it’s delicious
--------------------
this flavor tastes great
--------------------
Tastes really good! Fills me up, very good with crackers.
--------------------
I really liked this one! Tasted almost like a tuna salad for the same calories as plain tuna.
--------------------
I pack one of these tuna/salmon pouches most days for lunch and eat them with Ritz crackers. I’ve been adventurous in trying the different varieties, I thought the flavor of this one was terrible - not well combined, indistinguishable to “sweet and spicy.” Will not being buying this one again.
--------------------
Good. Definitely spicy.
--------------------
Not that great. It is more on the sweet side and not really spicy at all.
--------------------
Good for the price. Need to have a little less water and more tuna.
--------------------
The taste is good and it has simple ingredients. This may sound strange but I wish the metal lid was a bit thicker - it bends easily which makes it a little difficult to drain the water by squeezing the lid down onto the tuna.
--------------------
Tastes good. good price
--------------------
Fantastic product for a fantastic price!
--------------------
No additives and bpa free
--------------------
I was pleasantly surprised - good quality and taste - as good or better than more expensive brands. I will be buying again.
--------------------
Add a can of tuna to your cats dry and they will  love the new treat
--------------------
Nice taste and like how it comes in 4
--------------------
This high quality, sustainably caught tuna is very tasty!
--------------------
I really like knowing this is good quality tuna. I did however notice my local Target is carrying it now so wont' have to order online.
--------------------
It's a challenge anymore to find healthy fish. I don't eat a lot of it due to pollution issues but tuna is a nice option for quick meals. I especially like the Wild Planet brand. No additives. The low mercury option is a big draw. Tasty, convenient and healthier than most other brands. This had been cheaper but now is about the same price as my grocery store. But with Swanson's low shipping price I like to order it and support them.
--------------------
I was not impressed when I opened it up and ate it. It was good but not that much better than tuna you get at the grocery store. You will like it but is it really worth the extra money?
--------------------
I love this tuna, everything about it. It has the convenient pop top, its actually SOLID, one piece of fish not all flakey like most brands. Its delicous. The next time my husband goes underway I will be sending several of these with him so he can have an easy healthy alternative to the garbage served on cutters
--------------------
You are wasting your money if you buy any other tuna! The cans are packed so full with a solid chunk of tuna that you have to dig it out with a fork. It is premium and I am so glad I tried it.
--------------------
More expensive than other tuna but worth it, great taste.
--------------------
I'd been looking for the Wild Planet albacore tuna at a better price and that happened at Swanson's. If you are looking for a high Omega 3 albacore tuna, but are wanting to reduce the possibility of high mercury in it, then this is the tuna for you. The discounted price was also much better than my local grocery store so I bought it by the case. I'm new to albacore tuna - always bought the regular kind, so I'm not a expert on the flavor compared to other albacore tunas, but it tastes just fine.
--------------------
THIS TUNA IS TASTY, GREAT PRICE AND HEALTHY..WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY
--------------------
This tuna is delicious and I appreciate that it is line caught and a solid piece from one fish rather than pieces.
--------------------
I have heard of this tuna by several online Doctors and was very happy to find Swanson's carry it. It is by far the best canned tuna I have ever tasted, it so good I have a hard time not eating it right out of the can!
