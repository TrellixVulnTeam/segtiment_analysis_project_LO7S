I don’t know that it’s really so much Indian flavor food, but it’s very good for frozen organic food that I can fix in a hurry and tastes great!  I really like it a lot!  I do wish it was more on the spicy side—-but it’s very good nonetheless!!!
--------------------
I love this meal! I buy multiples of it and eat it at least 3-4 times per week for lunch. It's healthy, tasty and low in calories so pretty much ideal for me. I recommend trying it if you like Indian food flavors!
--------------------
Perhaps I am spoiled with my Indian food, but when it is impossible (read: expensive) to order out, you look for an acceptable substitute. This is not it. For those of you who are used to delicious Indian food, it lacks that spice that makes it delicious. Something was off about the food. There's no sugarcoating it - it just wasn't good. I've had the Amy's Indian Mutter Paneer before and I thought that was fine. However, if you are deciding what to do for dinner, just call the Indian restaurant. It will be more expensive, but I guarantee that your taste buds will thank you. I bought this on March 18 and ate it the day after.
--------------------
Wow. This exceeded my expectations by far. It’s so yummy and flavorful but mild and sweet. Perfect fix for my Indian food craving! Wish portion were bigger but it’s typical size for frozen meals
--------------------
This is VERY well seasoned and EXTREMELY flavorful! It is a little spicy though, so you might want some plain yogurt with it if you’re sensitive to chemical heat.￼ I wish there was only half as much salt, but it’s otherwise healthy. It’s flavorful enough that you can add an entire 10 oz. bag of frozen cauliflower rice to it without needing to add any further seasoning — that way it fills you up without too much sodium.￼￼￼ It’s honestly just as good as any of the Indian food I’ve ever had delivered — even from the most expensive restaurants!￼
--------------------
Amys is the only frozen complete meal company worth considering due to its high quality and consistency.  High marks for this one's nutritional value and is one of Amy's best variety of items for meals.  Remember to doctor up this meal with your favorite Indian spices, as Amys under-seasons its food generally so as not to scare away some of the squeamish consumers.  Also try the Indian wrap--quite good.  When heating these items always loosely cover with foil and add a few drops of water and olive oil on food to prevent drying.
--------------------
Lots of flavor! This is one of my favorites.
--------------------
I wish all of their meals had half as much salt as they do! This in no way requires more salt or seasoning of any kind! It’s very flavorful, and a little spicy — perfect!￼
--------------------
I really like this product! I was wary of what I'd be getting with enchiladas that were a total of 320 calories but was delightfully surprised. It's a good amount of food, relatively low in calories, and has a flavorful sauce. It could use a bit more spicing up, but to be fair, it's low in sodium. It's worth the price for a good lunch.

The sticky ginger chicken bowl was a big hit in my house. My boyfriend and 11 year old son thought it was amazing. They said it is delicious and filling. Nicely priced as well. I will definitely be buying this again and keeping it on hand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I wasn't sure what to expect when trying this Sticky Ginger chicken bowl but I loved it! What a great and convenient meal! And affordable. The flavors were surprisingly delicious! I would definitely recommend this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
tasted great but they really need to up the protein to 30 grams otherwise people are not getting enough protein. If people are having three meals a day which only has 18 g of protein per meal then that's only 54 grams of protein per day which is not nearly enough for most humans. 30 grams of protein is ideal for pretty much every human being. This can't be technically called a meal in my opinion but if they stop being cheap and added a little bit extra chicken and rice with a little less teriyaki sauce and sodium they'd have a perfect meal
--------------------
Really delicious and very generous portion. Don't understand the negative reviews. Excellent new dish from Lean Cuisine.
--------------------
Lean Cuisine Sticky Ginger Chicken Bowl is a great quick meal that includes white meat chicken with rice, vegetables and almonds in a ginger soy sauce. It is a bit sweet but the ginger helps to balance out the sweetness and I love that it contains 18 grams of protein and also really fills you up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
As far as boxed foods go, this one has good flavor. The texture is a bit off, in my opinion, but I do a lot of cooking from scratch, so it could just be my tastebuds. It is convenient to toss in the lunch bag or for a quick meal when you’re pressed for time. Not a bad thing to have on hand and the price is right. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is so yummy and great for anyone. I just had a baby so I'm eating these to assist in losing weight. This has so much flavor and super easy to just heat up after a long day. My husband and kids like it too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this ginger sticky bowl by lean cuisine about 1 month ago and it was good, flavorful and I could feel better knowing the ingredients were healthier than alternative frozen meals but I wish these were more filling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Healthier option than a freezer pizza, but not as filling. While I did enjoy the big chunks of meat, the vegetables just right (not too soggy after cooking), it's a small portion. Not a deal breaker though. I definitely recommend this Lean Cuisine Sticky Ginger Chicken Bowl though as the seasoning isn't over bearing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is a filling and satisfying meal. It’s easy to make and cook of course and beats cooking when I’m too busy. The taste hit my craving for Asian cuisine as well. I will look forward to trying different flavors. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I bought the Lean Cuisine Sticky Ginger Chicken Bowl and tried it today. This frozen meal is easy to heat up, and is ready in just a few minutes. It also low on calories and fat content, yet tastes great! I highly recommend this product to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Very delicious the chicken was my favorite it played sooo well with the meal I wish i had more I can eat these bowls everyday can’t wait to try more flavors I let my daughter try some and she went to get a spoon to share with me so it’s safe to say my family loves it and can’t wait to taste other flavors [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This bowl was absolutely delicious it heats up super quick for a quick me or snack packs easily in a lunch box or diaper bag. I would definitely buy these again to keep on hand they store easily and just great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The only flavor that I could taste in the Sticky Ginger Chicken Bowl was an overwhelming sweetness. There wasn’t even a hint of ginger flavor. Additionally, the chicken tasted like very low quality meat - almost like canned food. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I received a coupon for Lean Cuisine Sticky Ginger Chicken Bowl for my honest review. First off, the portions are generous, and it has 18 grams of protein. It has rice, chicken and veggies, and a tasty sauce. I normally don't eat a lot of frozen meals, but if I am, I try to eat healthier alternatives. I would definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
So my oppinion I am not overly excites about this product the taste is very bland it really doesn't have too much flavor as I expected it would it might have a better taste with more flavor that popped and gave you the wow factor [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I purchased this for my work day and something to keep in the freezer for those times that I forget to pack a lunch. It happens often! So I ate this one almost immediately after bringing to work. Our freezer is terrible so the little bit of frost burn flavor was almost definitely from the freezer and not the meal. It was really good and the exact amount to get me through the day. It would have been a little light for my husband and he probably would have to eat 2 to fee satisfied. For me, I like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I absolutely LOVE this meal. It has the perfect amount of portions. It is delicious and filling. I love all Lean Cuisine meals but the Sticky Ginger Chicken bowl is my new favorite! It’s great for a quick meal when you are in a hurry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
When I'm at work, I want a lunch option that is quick, easy, and fairly healthy. The Sticky Ginger Chicken Bowl tastes great, and the 18g of protein helps fill me up. The bowl is quick and easy to make in the microwave. The only real drawback for me is the sodium content; I would like to see less sodium in the dish. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
We really enjoyed this sticky ginger bowl! It was easy and quick to heat up. It's perfect for those busy days when you just want lunch without making a lot of effort! The sauce was really good, we love this ginger flavor! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It is always great having some easy pop in the microwave meals on hand for those busy nights. This one was delicious and definitely didn't taste like a frozen dinner. Good amount of flavor and chicken. Definitely recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I like frozen meals for work because they are quick to grab in the morning & quick to heat and eat. That being said, they aren’t the healthiest thing to have for lunch. I like the Lean Cuisine meals because they are better for you and typically have better ingredients. This one in particular (Sticky Ginger Chicken bowl) is decently tasty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I consumed this Life Cuisine frozen meal for the first time and I am pleasantly surprised. The portion of the meal is a lot more than expected for a frozen meal. The instructions were easy to follow for heating the meal in the microwave for a few minutes! This Sticky Ginger Chicken Bowl is so sweet and savory and the ginger flavor is so tasty in every bite. It contains a good amount of meat in comparison to the vegetable ingredients. The veggies even take to the ginger flavoring very well. I was pretty full after eating this and it was definitely satisfying! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This meal option is spectacular takes only a few minutes to heat and eat and meal heats through evenly good amount of protein and taste better than take out the ginger chicken is flavorful and tender and veggies and rice taste great in the sauce [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This was okay for the most part. It tasted okay but it didn't fill me up. Food barley cover the bottom of the bowl so although it tasted okay it wasnt enough of a portion for the money and I dont think I would spend the money for it again. Not to mention to be a "healthy choice" it sure had a lot of sodium. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Sticky Ginger Chicken Bowl was ok. The bowl had a lot of flavor, just personally did not enjoy. I found the serving size and calories to be decent for lunch, and felt the instructions given was perfect for correct temperature. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This sounded like a fantastic flavor and turned out ok. It's a great choice for a premade meal. Like always, looks iffy but still smelled great and was a good new find for my lunch options. It was a good combination of flavors, with nothing too strong or overpowering. Not the best thing I've ever had, but still a great new find. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I thought this was a pretty tasty little frozen meal. I'm usually not that much of a fan of the frozen meals. Its very easy to make, just microwave and eat. I liked the ginger flavor. I would purchase this again for an easy, quick week night meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love Ginger so this easy to make lean meal option was a must have for me. It's got that ginger spice kick in a thick succulent sauce that is bold and sweet BUT not overwhelming in a sense where it tastes of pure ginger. Everything comes together nicely in this bowl and each bite is a perfect balance combination. It has tender pieces of chicken with loads of vegetables and rice to really give it that oriental meal feeling. I'll definitely be buying this again, it's the perfect balance of ginger with every component of the bowl and each one compliments the other. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
If you are looking for a delicious and quick lunch that is more than just a sandwich or leftovers, Lean Cuisine's Sticky Ginger Chicken Bowl is for you. I brought this for lunch one day and it was super easy to heat in the microwave and it tasted amazing. It smelled so good that my co-worker asked what I was eating. I am a sucker for quick chinese food and this did not disappoint. Take it out of the packaging and pop it in the microwave and voila you have a great meal, that taste good and fills you up. Plus its Lean Cuisine so you feel better eating it than ordering take out that is higher in calories and fat. You get to eat what you like and not feel bad about it. I will definitely buy and eat this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love these frozen meals. They taste great, reheat well and are the prefect portions. Its affordable for any budget and you get a great meal on the go. The sticky ginger chicken was well flavored and made for a satisfying lunch. Definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
It was okay, I feel like it was easy to make so for a quick meal may be perfect. Food is hard to review because everyone has their own tastes of what they like and don’t like, I personally may try a different one next time, but more then likely I won’t buy them again. I do tend to like making my own foods though, instead of instant meals like this, so if you need something fast and nutritious that has decent flavor you’d probably love this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I'm a teacher, so I'm always looking for fast, healthy lunch options. I haven't had lean cuisine since I was in college, but I decided to give it another try. I usually get vegetarian frozen meals, but the ginger chicken was pretty good. The chicken didn't have the usual rubber texture of frozen meals which was nice, and the flavor was good. I don't think this would be enough food for a dinner but I will definitely try more Lean Cuisine options for lunch in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this because I'm getting weight loss surgery, I need lots of protein, which this has! And I need it healthy, which this is! So, I decided to get this. As it's "healthy" and has lots of protein, it's kind of pricy but well worth it because I only need one for lunch or dinner, whenever I'm having it. This was actually really good! I had lots of doubts about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have to say-can’t best the simplicity of the Sticky Ginger Chicken Bowl. So easy to pop in the microwave for a delicious nutritious meal. The portion is good too. Tastes like you worked hours to make it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This frozen meal was ok. It had good flavor, but lacked a little in the spice. It was slightly dry. I will give it another try, though. It cooked up well and is very convenient for meals at work. I added salt and pepper and that made it better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I didn't find anything special about this frozen meal. To.me it's just a typical tv dinner with bland flavor. But I guess if you are dieting this would not seem bland to you. Decent for a lean cuisine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This was a pleasant surprise! I do not normally buy these kinds of meals. Most frozen dishes are full of sodium and preservatives. However this is a healthier option. I must say it is very tasty. Not like other brands or bowls that are currently available. Easy to make in the microwave or oven. This really packs a flavor punch. Not too spicy or sweet. Will definitely purchase these and other flavors in the future [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This microwaveable ginger chicken bowl was delicious, the ginger was not overpowering, the rice was sticky, and the vegetables were evenly cooked. The instructions to cook were well written however it is one that you cook, then open the film to stir then cook longer. The meal portion were satisfactory and overall very good meal option! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
So this is definitely one of the better TV dinners that are healthier that I have tried. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel as it needed a little more sauce. The directions were about right for cooking it. It had a great flavor and left me filling full. I definitely recommend this if you are needing a healthier and easy meal.

The sticky ginger chicken bowl is good. The directions are easy and it cooks up in no time. A very fast healthy meal filled almonds, glaze, seared chicken, that is over rice. I did wish that the rice had more seasoning but other than that I really enjoyed it. The vegetables are fresh and cooked well once the meal is heated up. It is low in calories and great for meal prepping! I recommend this meal for on the go or simple fast meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I tried for the first time this sticky ginger chicken bowl by lean cuisine and it taste great. This meal was delicious and the bowl provides a reasonable portion of good food.

I have used Lean Cuisine products because they are tasty and help me to eat healthy. But I had not tried the new bowl dinners..I just tried the Sticky Ginger Chicken bowl and was very impressed. First it is larger 10!/4 oz. as compared to only 8 oz so helps to fill you up. It also has 18 grams of protein.and only 320 calories.Cooked as directed the veggies came out perfect not soggy.The sauce was flavorful ,a little thin but plenty to coat all the chicken,veggies and rice,I use a splash of soy sauce to give it a little extra flavor (but not necessary ) I was surprised that it filled me up and I was not hungry until my next meal time. I recommend this to all my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I had been bummed out to see that the almond chicken entree was no longer being carried in any of my area groceries. Then I saw this dish and decided to try it; I like it even more than what had been my favorite!
--------------------
love this dish. perfect amount of ingredients with good ratios.
--------------------
I love Lean Cuisine. It helped keep me alive in rehab facility where the cooking was so awful I lost over 30 lbs. in a month. My husband would stop at the store and grab one of those tasty meals so I would have something edible. However, this week I purchased a sticky ginger chicken bowl. It had less flavor than the stuff cooked in the rehab facility. I had to sprinkle it with soy sauce so that it tasted like something. No flavor at all. I have one other 'bowl" left. Perhaps I can feed it to the cat.
--------------------
I normally don't like the flavor of ginger and I actually bought this my mistake not realizing it had ginger in it. I was very surprised how great this meal tasted. Very mild ginger and slightly sweet.
--------------------
This did not have any ginger flavor. It had some sort of sauce that was too sweet. Would not purchase again.
--------------------
Great taste, will definitely buy again, and finally no red peppers! A little heavy on the added sugar.
--------------------
I hate frozen meals but this delighted my taste buds. Every bite was delicious! I am so happy with this purchase I will definitely be buying more of this Sticky Ginger Chicken.
--------------------
I don't like posting bad reviews, but this one had to happen. I like this flavor, and I routinely purchased it. I did notice that the amount of beef has been decreasing, and in fact, I received one without any beef at all. It's quite disappointing, and I started purchasing other brands of frozen meals.
--------------------
The flavor is absolutely perfect. And I don't really mind the ratio of rice to beef. It's brown rice, not white, by the way. Also, I thought it needed more veggies so I just opened a can of carrots and mixed them in. LC meals are a great starting point for a little culinary sleight of hand in the kitchen. Not enough beef? Some leftover steak from the fridge will solve that. Not enough veggies? Add whatever you like, frozen or canned. You still get that yummy sauce that pairs well with pretty much anything.
--------------------
I use to like this one but now its too watery and less rice.
--------------------
I can't stop buying these please don't take it away i love them so much my doctor was so proud of me for losing so much weight but i didn't tell her my secret that it was the lean cuisines and this is my ultimate favorite so yummy thank you for your hard work during the COVID-19 pandemic.
--------------------
I bought this for the first time about a month ago and I can’t say enough good things about it! Delicious! You have to try this one I guarantee you will love it!!
--------------------
I have bought this meal multiple times because it's my favorite. I took one for work today and I was missing a key ingredient..beef. Not one shred of meat was in this meal.Line workers and QA dropped the ball on this batch.
--------------------
I had this for the first time today and I was very pleasantly surprised. I´ve been eating Lean Cuisine for many years, and I expected it to be a little lacking in flavor or the beef, tough. But it was anything but lacking in flavor. It was delicious! And, I don't know HOW y´all get that meat so tender. Amazing! Definitely getting this again.

I have had this product several times, and am always pleased with the product. It is easily one of the best frozen entrees I get for lunch-at-work.
--------------------
This is my favorite Lean cuisine. I would recommend this. The meat is tender and the sweet and spicy is just the right amount of flavor, not to strong as in other meals I have tried.
--------------------
I have eaten home- made Korean food for years.  This is the first frozen entree that I've found to be very good.  This is something that I'll be buying on a regular basis from now on.
--------------------
This is a must-have repeat buy each time I stock up on frozen healthy lunch meals for work. The flavor and ingredients are the best! Hit's all my target food groups without being too heavy on sodium. It's filling
--------------------
I love this stuff! Could eat it everyday!! The whole family loves it! :)
--------------------
This is soooooo good. Just the right amount of spice and no broccoli (my least favorite vegetable)
--------------------
I recently switched to a gluten and dairy free diet and was so happy to discover that there were still a few lean cuisines I could eat. I just had this one today for lunch and LOVED IT! This will definitely be on my reoccurring list! Please make more gluten and dairy free meals!
--------------------
I had this for the first time tonight! It truly was so good! The beef was so thick and tender! The sauce was amazing with just the right amount of spicy! Definitely picking up a few more on my next grocery run! Bravo!!!!
--------------------
I love the sweet and spicy Korean beef, it’s my favorite.
--------------------
This is by far my favorite LC meal. I could eat this one 4 to 5 times a week.
--------------------
I love this Korean style beef meal. It's sweet and spicy and better than some restaurant meals I've had. I love that it's gluten free too. Thank you for such a great gluten free option!
--------------------
The beef is always tender and the sauce is delicious! Its a bit on the sweet side, but I don't mind. Sometimes I wish there was a bit more of that tender beef! One of my favorites!!
--------------------
We normally love Lean Cuisine. However, this particular flavor was just awful. The beef consistency was practically gelatinous & the rice had an unidentifiable odor. The flavor was NOT good.
--------------------
Maybe it's been a fluke, but the two times I've had this, the bowl's contents LOOKED LIKE THE PICTURE ON THE BOX! A very tasty concoction, but the word "spicy" doesn't deserve to be in the entree's title. It will be a perpetual entry on my grocery list.
--------------------
I’m always perplexed by folks buying meals labeled “lean” and whining about the lack of meat? There’s enough meat in this dish to pack 15gr of protein and, btw, the rice is brown. You want more sauce, don’t pick a diet meal!!! Come on folks, be less dim-witted. What might oughta concern you is the claim that they only use ingredients found in your kitchen. How many of us have “modified corn starch product” or “modified corn starch” in our pantries? Just curious since Nestle is mighty proud of its ingredients. Anyway, looking for more meat and unlimited sauce?....maybe ask the Golden Corral to create a line of frozen meals.
--------------------
This meal is well seasoned, with lots of vegs, and large chunks of beef over a generous portion of rice. Great alternative to all the chicken and pasta meals.
--------------------
My husband purchased this item and I was skeptical. Tonight I didn't feel like eating a bunch of meat and wanted something good. This was delicious!! I couldn't eat just one.
--------------------
What's not to like? Hearty chunks of seasoned beef, sweet and savory flavorful sauce, heary portion of rice and vegetables that heat up nicely... I highly recommend this one!
--------------------
One note - just spice. Seems like many dishes have same overall taste.
--------------------
This was really good!!! I usually buy frozen vegetables & add to these meals, mix it up with the sauce, this did not disappoint, will definitely buy this one again!
--------------------
This Lean Cuisine has always been my favorite. Lately, I'm getting disappointed by it. It seems to be less beef, less vegetables, and more rice. The last one I had was pretty dry as well. Still tastes great just disappointed by the amount of beef and vegetables lately.
--------------------
I absolutely love this!!! Tender beef and delicious rice!!! Amazing! I have lost 20 lbs eating lean cuisine!!
--------------------
For years I have eaten Sweet & Spicy Korean-Style Beef for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. As a result, I have developed a very sensitive palate for the dish. However, lately, I have noticed a marked decline in the taste and quality of the food. There is more rice and less meat, and not as much sauce. I am very disappointed in the current product and have begun the process of looking for a replacement product.
--------------------
Think cheap...... Disgustingly cheap Asian glare. Literally tried to at least eat half of it before I tried adding somthing that would help the disgusting taste. NOPE! Nothing helped. By far the worst I’ve ever had. Literally don’t waste all the money on this one. Complete trash...... AND I LOVE ASIAN FOOD, EVEN THE CHEAP KIND!!!!
--------------------
I've been buying these for a few months now and this one is my all time favorite. The only thing I'd suggest improving on is MORE SAUCE. The entire meal is only 320 calories. I'd rather them add enough sauce to cover all the rice, veggies, and beef and add 50 to 100 calories! Also more veggies, no calories there! Other than that, this Lean Cusine meal is amazing for when you're craving Asain food but don't want the calories.
--------------------
This was the first time I tried this one and it was delicious. Not too spicy and the flavors were great. The meat was so tender and the rice and veggies were a nice balance.
--------------------
I can't get enough of this dinner. Its simply delicious. The meat is especially tender and, overall, its not too spicy.
--------------------
I used to love Lean Cuisine, the only brand I bought. Now everything is so spicy, it is inedible. To bad they brought in "chefs".
--------------------
This is my favorite LC entree of all time. Was not expecting it to be as good as it was. My only complaints are, 1.one time, and one time only, the meat was slightly fatty. 2. Could use a bit more sauce and veggies! Other than that these are really good & keep you very satisfied!
--------------------
Wonderful dish. The meat is so tender I cut it with a plastic spoon. I am glad to see whole grain rice used versus white rice. The chewiness adds to all the textures you will experience in this dish. The flavor is great and the smell caught the attention of my Korean coworker that also approved of the meal. He knows his native cuisine like the back of his hand so take it as a compliment all you out there wanting to give it a try!
--------------------
Tasty but virtually vegetarian. I don’t eat meat often but sometimes I crave and oblige. This meal had one stringy piece of beef so basically stayed vegetarian
--------------------
I was pleasantly surprised at how good this meal was, I would definitely recommend it!
--------------------
I buy this all the time, it's my #1 go to meal! The meat is tasty & tender. I really enjoy the brown rice. My only negative is the quality control, sometimes I only get a couple of pieces of meat or the sauce is very watery. However the taste is so good that I still give it 5 stars.
--------------------
I wish this dish had a little more vegetables and maybe a little less rice.
--------------------
When I have a taste for asian and know I need to keep my calories in check - this is what I reach for. So tasty!
--------------------
This item was so much better than I anticipated. The sauce was delicious - spicy yet sweet - and the beef was tender. The right amount of vegetables were mixed in with the rice to add some texture. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it and plan to buy it more frequently.
--------------------
One of my favorites! The beef is tender, love the taste of the brown rice and the sauce is delicious. One suggestion that I have is wish that it was lighter on the garlic - a little too much for my liking especially for a work lunch.
--------------------
I have bought this line for almost 10 years but they have really improved and expanded!This is one of my absolute favorites out of many!!!So delicious and I appreciate the brown rice as a healthier option.Please keep the great dishes coming:)!
--------------------
The beef is very good but there could be more sauce. If there was more sauce, this would have rated excellent
--------------------
I've been buying the Cheese and Bean Enchilada Verde and the Sweet & Spicy Korean Beef (it's not hot/spicy, just tasty) meals and they are two of the best things I've ever eaten.
--------------------
I'm always looking for new, convenient and healthy options for lunch. I've tried many of the gf Lean Cuisine options and I keep going back to this particular one. Love the sauce in this dish. Lots of great veggies and fills me up until dinner time.
--------------------
I have been eating Lean Cuisines for my lunch at work for over a year now and this product has stayed on my top favorites the whole time. The sauce is so delicious, sweet, spicy, tangy and just all around amazing. The beef has been wonderfully succulent and tender every time EXCEPT once when it was chewy. But hey, can't be perfect all the time, right? I'm not sure what the yellow veggies are exactly but they are amazing with the sauce and rice. On a side note: PLEASE BRING BACK THAI STYLE GINGER BEEF!! IT WAS MY #1 FAVORITE. My god that meal was incredible. I'm surprised I haven't seen protesting going on because they discontinued it.
--------------------
I really am enjoying the ethnic flavors and hope they will continue this past the original introductory period. With all of the lean cuisine choices, I agree that there could be more veggies, but I love the flavor of the beef and the rice in this one.
--------------------
One of my favorite LC meals ever! A great blend of flavors, and this may sound weird, but great textures (expecially the rice). I highly recommend to all!
--------------------
I don't usually like healthy food like this but this is my absolute favorite except the green thing I think cucumber and it was delicious pls don't ever take this out of production I'd be very sad and keep up the great work I'll keep buying these until I get so sick of them ty for making good food
--------------------
This meal is absolutely delicious. I can literally eat it every day.
--------------------
I purchased about 3 of these 2 weeks ago. I'm glad I did- I am giving 4 stars because I clearly agree with some of the reviewers, the veggies were just not there (in size), just pure minced size veggies. However, the Beef was right on, tender, and perfect for this meal. Had the veggies kicked in (larger in portion and size) it would have been amazing. The rice was delicious, (brown rice)- overall the flavor was there! What I did notice on the box it said "limited time only". I surely hope not, because these are really delicious! In summary: Rice amount ok, Meat amount and flavor of sauce super delicious, Veggies - Need more.
--------------------
Sweet & Spicy Korean-Style Beef is life! the only one I eat everyday at lunch. keeps me full until dinner time!
--------------------
I loved the flavors! There were large pieces of beef. Reason for four instead of five: There was very little veggies hidden among all that rice.
--------------------
This one of my "go to" meals at work. It is the best frozen entre I have eaten.
--------------------
Love the taste! To up the fullness factor, I mix in a 1/2 bag of either plain steamed snap peas or zucchini - works like a charm. Also, I'm very finicky with the quality and taste of beef in general, but this beef is wonderful. So I'm totally ok with less but better quality meat. Another winner for me!
--------------------
This is my favorite Lean Cuisine Meal. The flavor is perfect, and it really satisfies cravings because it feels a bit decadent. I also love that it's gluten free. I could use a bit more zucchini, but no complaints from me.
--------------------
Delicious entree and the rice is a nice side. It's nice to get some flavorful meals that are low in calories and fat. Really tasty!
--------------------
I love the flavor but today at lunch mine didn't have any meat! I have seen people complain about the small amount of meat well mine had none at all.
--------------------
This is my second favorite Asian meal from Lean Cuisine. I love the Thai Ginger Beef but this one is also very tasty! There is good, lean, beef and great vegetables too with the rice. I think it is perfect for lunch and I always feel satisfied when I eat it. I am now hooked on Lean Cuisine and plan to try more from this line of food. You can beat the price either and the selection! Keep up the excellent work, Lean Cuisine!
--------------------
When I read the boxes ingredients I noticed 650 grams of sodium. You cannot call that healthy!!
--------------------
This is a new favorite. Perfect blend of flavors, subtle kick. Added cucumber and lettuce salad, steamed peapods, and two cutie oranges for a balanced dinner. Stuffed! I highly recommend this meal! Please keep this one Lean Cuisine!
--------------------
Just had this for dinner. I was very disappointed when I opened it up and saw or rather didn't see any vegetables. I mean really. You couldn't say carrots other than the 1 or 2 flecks of orange, not even a small floret of broccoli. The amount of beef was fine for me. I really had a bowl of rice for dinner. Not exactly what I am looking for in a fast healthy dinner. The positive I have to say is the flavor was awesome.
--------------------
I bought one box last week. I couldn't believe how delicious it was. Went back and bought 5 more boxes.
--------------------
I enjoy all the Lean Cuisine meals. Not only do they taste great they are low on calories and high in protein. On a diet eating these meals for lunch and dinner most every day, I lost 35lbs.
--------------------
I enjoyed this meal quite alot, and I did feel happily satisfied after I finished it. The flavors are quite nice without being overpowering or too salty, and with the addition of a little garlic chili paste you can turn up the heat without too heavily damaging the plate's nutritional profile. I really loved this one.
--------------------
Its not often I eat frozen meals but the holiday season had me in a hurry all the time. This was 2 dollars when I saw they had a sale on it so I said what the heck and grabbed a few different ones. This was by far my favorite. The beef was super tender and juicy, not much of it though. I am aware though its common in frozen foods. It didnt bother me. The brown rice and veggies with the sauce made for a light yet satisfying side. It was the perfect size meal for me and for someone who has trouble with portion control.
--------------------
I stole this one from my hubby one day and was very surprised about how tasty it was. So much so that I want to try more of these fresh and tasty meals on those work days that are too rushed for a real lunch break. I added more spice because I'm a chili head but other than that? I loved the bright yellow carrots, fluffy brown rice and just about everything this dish has to offer.
--------------------
I love the flavor of the Sweet and Spicy Korean Style Beef. However, the term "Beef" is an exaggeration. My most recent purchase had 3 smallish bites of beef, tiny vegetable pieces and a pile of white rice. Not even enough sauce to moisten all of the rice. Most disappointing. Earlier purchases had been more generous. And it has 9 grams of sugar and 7 grams of fat. Not worth the money or calories.
--------------------
I received this from someone who didn't want it. Now I want to purchase more! It was really good tasting and satisfied my craving for Asian food with significant calorie savings! I also appreciate the fact that there was brown rice and my entre also had quite a few veggies. I am trying to cut back on meat so that was not a significant concern for me. My major concern was the sodium content. And there were quite a few carbs but it was worth it....much better than a snickers bar with almost the same amount of calories! I can't wait to try more!
--------------------
I really enjoyed eating this. You don't get a ton of beef and sauce BUT you can mix it all together and it is delicious. My only complaint is the 15g of sugar. Its supposed to be a LEAN cuisine.
--------------------
The beef was tender, the sauce was good, and an abundance of rice with veggies. Will buy again for my lunches.
--------------------
I've purchased this dinner 8 or 9 times because it is so good. Being single and tired when I get home, this meets my hunger and taste needs. Another goodie.
--------------------
It has an excellent taste. i would recommend this product to a friend
--------------------
This is the first time my wife and I tried Sweet and Spicy Korean-Style Beef. We don't really know what Korean Style Beef should taste like, but this item tasted very good. We have tried many Lean Cuisine items over the past several years. We would buy this item again.
--------------------
Had this today, only 1 quarter sized portion of beef. like the flavor and will try again.
--------------------
So glad I tried this! Smashing flavors. Would like a bit more beef, less zucchini
--------------------
I love Korean BBQ so even though I don't normally buy the beef LCs I thought I would try this, but I was disappointed in this product. #1 it contains *19 grams* of sugar. #2 there were hardly any veggies at all (unlike the picture). I never expect much actual meat in these frozen meals, so the small amount of beef didn't bother me, but come on, veggies are delicious and have virtually zero caloric impact! And white rice is terrible for you, so to get a giant bowl of essentially all white rice with a sugary sauce on top of it was pretty disappointing. So much for my "healthy" dinner!
--------------------
The Sweet & Spicy Korean-Style Beef is my most favorite, it's like taste buds traveled to Korea only without a passport. Very tasty!
--------------------
The beef flavor and tenderness in this meal is excellent. Would like to see more vegetables.
--------------------
This is tied as one of my favorites. Great flavor, not so spicy that it makes my nose run. I agree that it could use more either meat or preferably vegetables.
--------------------
This is one of my "go-to" meals in the Marketplace category. I really love the exotic flavors in this meal and I find it extremely satisfying.
--------------------
a nice change than the usual Lean Cuisine Product!
--------------------
I was so excited to see this in my grocery's frozen food section. This has a perfect blend of spicy and sweet.
--------------------
I've been eating LC for so long that I've grown bored with what is becoming bland meals. I am excited that something different has come along and mixed things up! This is one of my favorites!
--------------------
So tasty I wish there was more, but then again I guess it wouldn't be "lean" cuisine!
--------------------
This is a favorite for my husband & myself! The seasonings are perfect!
--------------------
Finally found a tasty microwavable, low cal lunch entrée. Starting eating this 3 months ago and am down 20 lbs!
--------------------
I love Korean food and decided to give this a try. Pleasantly delighted. I buy it as often as I can find it. Must be popular because it isn't always available at my local store.
--------------------
To be very honest this is not at all spicy, like I would expect from authentic Korean food. That being said, it is DELICIOUS! The beef is super-tender, the portion of rice is perfect and the sauce is sweet and luscious. Could use more veggies, but if you pair this with a salad, you're good to go!
--------------------
I was hoping for more complex flavors but all I could taste was heat. Just OK. I could have doused an entree with hot sauce myself.
--------------------
I'm not always super excited to warm and eat my little frozen lunch. This is the exception! This is very tasty. Didn't need anything to spice it up. Quite delicious and I would recommend and eat every week without tiring of it.
--------------------
This is by far the BEST lean cuisine entree to me!! I love the flavors and sauce.It's just the right amount of everything. I highly recommend this!!
--------------------
The beef was tender for a frozen meal; there was a little heat in the dish...which I loved! I kept saying to myself, this is sooo good!
--------------------
I keep my freezer stocked with lean cuisine's and the sweet and spicy korean style beef is my absolute favorite.
--------------------
Great flavors and awesome pieces of meat! The sauce was very good.
--------------------
Just ate today and loved it!! One of my new favorites - healthy but super good!
--------------------
And it was the perfect size. Since I've had gastric bypass surgery, most meals are too much to eat. This one is convenient, the right size and above all tasty. I look for adequate amounts of protein and under 750mg of sodium. Thank you!
--------------------
I buy this meal all the time. The only thing I would like to see is that Lean Cuisine create this same meal with cauliflower as the mashed potatoes. That would make it a really high protein/low carb meal.
--------------------
The meatloaf is tender and has great flavor with the gravy. Only issue is the consistency of the potatoes. And jeesh take it easy on the salt. We can add our own. People are buying these to be healthier.
--------------------
This dinner is so tasty! The meatloaf gravy is savory and the potatoes are real! Add a little salt and pepper and you’re good to go! I eat two a week, at least! Only 240 calories and 22 net carbs!
--------------------
My grandmother is on a restricted sodium diet because of a heart condition. In addition to this (among several other medical concerns), she also has cognitive issues that make it difficult for her to adapt to sudden changes in her usual routine. Back in 2017, she was hospitalized from May until August for issues relating to her heart and lungs. At that time, doctors wanted to place her in hospice because they felt that she would not survive for more than a few more months. I could not accept this. My grandmother is a wonderful person; she took me in (as a seven year-old child) and raised me when my own father and mother would not. I refused to listen to the medical advice and took my grandmother in with me. While there have been bumps in the road along the way; over the last three years my grandmother has thrived. Balancing work and taking care of my grandmother, while more than worth it, has been a great effort. Although I strive to make homemade meals whenever possible; we have come to depend on the use of frozen meals when this is not feasible. The Lean Cuisine Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes meal was one of her favorites; one that she would enjoy at least a few times a week. Until very recently, this meal had a sodium content of 540mg. It now has a sodium content of 870mg. This is an increase of 330mg for the same sized portion. If I may, I would like to make a few comments and pose some questions regarding this change. Why was this change to a higher amount of sodium implemented? Had there been a deluge of complaints about the taste of the meal as it was previously made? According to Lean Cuisine’s Frequently Asked Questions (specifically under “Why is the sodium level in your products so high?”); it states that “Lean Cuisine is part of an initiative to undergo gradual but steady recipe changes through 2015 in order to bring down sodium levels”. Has Lean Cuisine left/given up on this “initiative”? Also, in that same statement, it says that “the u.s. [sic] department of health and human services [sic] and department of agriculture [sic] advise that adults in general limit their sodium intake to 2,300mg daily. the [sic] guidelines further recommend a reduced limit of 1,500 mg for persons who are 51 and older and those of any age who are african [sic] american [sic] or have hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease.” Based off of the guidelines given; would it be safe for me to assume that Lean Cuisine does not recommend that people over the age of 50, African American’s of any age or individuals diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease partake in this particular meal, at all? Finally, I would just like to ask if it is reasonable to put 870mg of sodium (well over a third of what even a healthy individual is recommended to consume in a day) in to what is a rather small portioned meal? This itself contradicts another example from Lean Cuisine’s Frequently Asked Questions (specifically under “How much sodium in Lean Cuisine?”); where it states that “Lean Cuisine dishes have between 280mg and 730mg of sodium (avg. of 600mg). We passionately care about balancing flavor and nutrition in our recipes. On average, eating a Lean Cuisine entrée would represent 26% of your daily sodium intake as recommended by the FDA”.
--------------------
I bought 5 different meals of this brand and I've never been this picky to where I cant eat something, let alone throw away something I've spent money on. With this particular meal the potatoes tasted like I was eating a spoonful of salt rock. And no words for the meat just terrible extremely bland.
--------------------
I really hated the taste and texture of the meatloaf. I couldn’t eat it. The potatoes were pretty good, but overall not a good meal.
--------------------
My parents, age 90 and 92, rely on Lean Cuisine for many of their meals as mom doesn't cook much anymore. Dad had a heart attack last fall and has to restrict his sodium. This meal at 540 mg Sodium was a really good flavored meal and one that he really enjoyed. He doesn't have room in any of his meal periods for an extra 330 mg sodium. So disappointing. We no longer will be recommending this particular Lean Cuisine meal.
--------------------
The taste is amazing, not what I was expecting. The meatloaf and mashed potatoes didn't taste fake or over salty. Loved that the gravy was a brown gravy instead of a sweet ketchup like one.
--------------------
Sodium in the new version at 870 mg compared to 540 in the previous more tasty (IMHO) version? What is happening to more healthy foods? There are other varieties of Lean Cuisine that I've enjoyed, though now the Glazed Chicken, Parmesan Crusted Fish, and othershave changed for the worse.
--------------------
This was one of my fave go-to meals that I always had in my freezer. Low calorie and low in carbs compared to most. Sodium was reasonable for a frozen diet meal. Generally much less than the Smart ones. So I was shocked to see in the new version that the sodium has increased from 540 to 870, a 60% increase in sodium, and a deal breaker for me as I need to limit my intake. As much as the Lean Cuisine Pepperoni Pizza. The meal certainly doesn't taste any better for it. This is not the first meal they have ruined. First the Glazed Chicken, then more recently the Tortilla Fish, and now the Meatloaf. I have been a long-time fan of Lean Cuisine but with the changes, I will have to start looking elsewhere.
--------------------
Doesn’t taste like diet cardboard food. It’s actually very good.
--------------------
Why must you add soy to all your chicken and beef products? Twenty years ago Lean Cuisine meals never included protein soy isolate, which is just an extender and offers Nestle a greater profit margin. Soy extender makes the food taste unnatural and rubbery, like it was made in a lab. I would much rather pay more for a better quality piece of chicken or beef. In the late 1980's Lean Cuisine made the best chicken marsala - real chicken breast, no extenders that came in a bag. It was restaurant quality. PLEASE REMOVE ALL YOUR SOY AND OTHER BINDERS FROM YOUR MEAT AND CHICKEN ENTREES. CHARGE MORE BUT GIVE US ENTREES THAT ARE JUST CHICKEN OR BEEF - WITH NO FILLERS OR ADDITIVES. PEOPLE WOULD BE HAPPY TO PAY A LITTLE MORE FOR BETTER QUALITY, NATURAL MEALS.
--------------------
Picky husband loved the meatloaf taste, potatoes were good too. Cooking direction was spot on . Will buy this again.
--------------------
I'ts OK but would be better with brown gravy instead of the tomato base
--------------------
One of my delicious favorite go to from lean cuisine!
--------------------
I have been saving my money so I can buy more than one of these at a time. I never had meatloaf in my 64 year old life, so I wasn't prepared how to react. I LOVED it and the mashed new potatoes. The sauce/gravy was really good. The new potatoes was a nice surprise and I was pleasantly full. I can't wait to get more of this product. Who knew I'd LOVE meatloaf? The best!
--------------------
I had this in the freezer and when school started back I found it just when I needed an easy comfort meal. The potatoes were "real" and mashed well with some peel...just like homemade (if I ever make them anymore!) Meatloaf was just the right size and filling! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have been buying this product for years. It is very flavorful and it is my favorite Lean Cuisine choice. I am on a low sodium, low fat diet. It falls within the boundaries of my dietary limits.
--------------------
I tried this product out about a week ago and it was delicious. I am not a big fan of lean cuisine but I won't mind buying this brand again. Next time I'm in the grocery store I might pick another one up so my children can try lean cuisine out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I prefer dinners with about 20g of protein to carry me to the next meal without hunger. This does the trick and tastes good too!
--------------------
Lean Cuisine takes concern when it presents it's product. Everything including the price is just right.. Sometimes I get home to tired to cook, I get a wonderful meal in ten minutes. add a salad an all is good.. The best part for me is that so many of these great meals work with Weight Watchers!
--------------------
I alternate between the glazed turkey tenderloins with sweet potatoes and stuffing and this one. Filling and tasty!
--------------------
I should have known better. The taste of this was ok, I just kept thinking, "I wonder what is in this patty". I buy these for lunch at work. Will not be purchaing this again.
--------------------
I got this a few months back and i really enjoyed the meatloaf with mash potatoes togather.would buy again for a quick meal. Would recommend to anyone that's single and don't feel like cooking a big meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I used to love the meatloaf, but it seems they are using their salsbury steak patties as meatloaf now and just changing the sauce. Not great!
--------------------
I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor and texture of this meal. I like Lean Cuisine meals in general, but I don't eat them expecting the full flavors of a home cooked meal. However, the meatloaf tasted just as good as if I made it and the potatoes were equally delicious. Great meal for a lunch break during work.
--------------------
I only recently began buying frozen dinners- but I had surgery, and I can only eat so much at once, and need a lot of protein, and Lean Cusine is just the ticket.I bought this one because of the raving reviews... did they change the recipe recently? The "gravy" on the top tastes like salsa... or maybe ranchero enchilada sauce? NOT what goes on meatloaf. Very odd and didn't go. Other than that, the meat tastes OK, and the mashed potatoes were pleasantly good.
--------------------
I've tried tons of frozen meals but lean cuisine comforts are by far the best...great flavor, good portions, and full of real ingredients. Also very affordable so instead of wasting time and money on fast food, be sure to pick up one of the many lean cuisine comforts in the frozen isle.
--------------------
I didn't hate the mashed potatoes, the meatloaf needed real ketchup. I would but this again, but I would have enhance the flavor myself.
--------------------
I often find frozen diet foods very "diet tasting". This meal was fantastic. The meat wasn't filled with gristle or fat. The potatoes have some skin in it which provided an enjoyable, satisfying texture. The flavor of this meal was spot on for a lean meal and I ate it slowly as to enjoy every bite. I will definitely be purchasing this meal again and will purchase in bulk for days I simply need some "comfort food".
--------------------
I had my Snr mom help me with the taste part of the test. She said it was seasoned well enough for her. We did like that it could be heated eather in the oven or the microwave. We chose the microwave for this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I had this last night and really liked it a lot, also the sodium content was better than a lot of other meals from different companies, - but the portion of the mashed potatoes was sooo small, it wouldn't even be enough for a 2 year old toddler! I'd gladly buy it again but with a normal portion of mashed potatoes? Thank you for considering this!
--------------------
This is one of my favorites. I add some reduced 50% sodium peas for some more color and veggies. I wish you would lower the sodium content of your meals. Let the buyer add salt to taste.
--------------------
I'm not a huge fan of meatloaf. I bought it because the mashed potatoes looked good. To my surprise, the meatloaf tasted even better than home cooked meatloaf! And the mashed potatoes were the best mashed potatoes that I have ever had!
--------------------
Bought it a week ago I'm so glad I did my son and his girlfriend also liked it
--------------------
This is a low fat, low calorie dinner which I didn't enjoy the taste as much i thought I would. But I will try the other lean cuisine dinners. I would say this is a product for anyone who doesn't like salty products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
First time having this one, won't be my last!! Did not taste like a "diet" meal!
--------------------
I was so excited to try this product but it didn't meet my expectations. The potatoes were good but the meatloaf needed more flavor to it. But for being a frozen food item I guess it was good. I don't think I would buy again though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this over a month ago, an really enjoyed, it didn't taste processed, very tasty , got some more different meals, I like it because of the portions, they are just right, it's become a meal the I enjoy regularly [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I don't normally shop for premade food as taste is usually a compromise. I really like meatloaf. Although this was not as good as my moms it was pretty good and if I wasn't ravenously hungry I could do this dinner again. It was a large enough serving to take my hunger away but I was hungry again in another hour. I am a pretty big eater. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

While it’s not home cooked it is a delicious quick substitute. The potatoes were creamy and the meatloaf was satisfying. Lean Cusine is an easy way to get a full meal when I’m on the go or in a rush at work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I really liked how easy it was to prep this meal, just heat up and you got a complete meal in a few minutes. Great taste in a traditional comfort food meal. Creamy mashed potatoes and tasty meatloaf while still eating healthy and keeping your lifestyle. Would definitely buy again and might even become a staple in my home.

This line on Lean Cuisine meals have a great flavor and provide plenty of variety so you won’t get bored. I keep a few in the freezer for when I’m working late or other things come up. The portions are ideal to feel full but not overstuffed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this product free in return for an honest review. I wasn’t sure how this Lean Cuisine would taste, as I’m not dieting. But I gave it a try, the potion was a decent size. The meatloaf and mashed potatoes was mmm mmm delicious. The meatloaf was so tender, it like literally melts in your mouth, the red skin potatoes was creamy and delicious. It tasted great to my surprise lol, I enjoyed it :)!! I definitely recommend this product, if you’re looking for a healthier lifestyle or just wants to eat better.

--------------------
I picked this up in store figuring I would just give it a try. I normally dont use microwave dinners, especially lean ones. So, it cooked it which seemed to get done faster than most, when I opened it looked like someone took care to prepare it. The taste was actually pretty good compared to other brands Ive ate.

I tried this recently & thought it was a great little meal for lunch. It was a good sized lunch portion, it was nicely prepared & packaged. The meat tasted surprisingly well for being frozen, it was seasoned well & the sides were accommodating sized portions that also tasted good. The variety of different meals was also a nice surprise. I already have a few more I wanna try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
It's hard to believe that this meatloaf is low fat. The flavor was way better than I expected from a frozen dinner. I also liked the mashed potatoes and how buttery they are. A really delicious meal to eat when you're low on time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I've been buying Lean Cuisine for years but had never seen meatloaf and potatoes in one so I was very excited! Meatloaf and potatoes are a staple at my house but I don't have time to make it. This is a very nice alternative! Gives me the comfort of home without the kitchen mess, easy peasy and a healthier version. I found it to be quite satisfying! Meatloaf had just the right amount of seasoning, nice tomato sauce and the potatoes were nice and creamy without the heaviness. This will be a nice substitution for when I don't have time to cook my own plus it's very handy for work lunches! Yum! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Since I pack my lunch for work I couldn't wait to try something new but all while being a snack that would fill me up. It was ready in five minutes and the mash potatoes were awesome.The little pieces of meat gave it a great taste and the meatloaf was soft and easy to cut into with my fork.Reminded me of a home cooked meal.Great for my entire family as you just need a microwave.It also filled me up and to my surprise for being a microwave prep meal it was very tender and not bland like most quick meals I've tried in the past.I've already recommended this to my family and friends. It's five stars all the way as I was able to save money as this was very affordable! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Meatloaf & mashed potatoes were almost like homemade but not quite. although it was better than the typical frozen dinner it still had the same texture of mashed potatoes. i am not sure how potatoes can be improved frozen however. the meatloaf was tasty. texture was good on it. if i had to choose another frozen dinner for lunch i would more than likely sway towards this one again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Lean Cuisine Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes is so much better than the 'olden' days tv dinners. It's very easy and convenient to make and eat.

If I served Lean Cuisine Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes to my family without mentioning that it was a heat up dinner I'm positive they wouldn't know the difference from homemade. The quality and taste is outstanding! It's rare to find a quick fix meal that's very good, Lean Cuisine has mastered this though. Hands down best easy fix in the market. Lower in calories than any others and all around healthier! I feel really great about feeding Lean Cuisine to my family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Meatloaf is one of my favorite meals to make. I will say that the taste of the Lean Cuisine was a bit above average. It is a filling meal that doesn't weigh you down in calories and has a good amount of protein. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The meatloaf was the best meatloaf I've had in a TV dinner. The sauce complimented the meat, and was not a distraction. The mashed potatoes was a chunky with skins potato and again was different than other dinner where the mashed potatoes are soupy. It was hard to believe that it was, "lean" cuisine.

I bought this product 1 week ago and just trying it now. It only took 4min in my microwave the meatloaf has great flavor, its moist not dry, theres a perfect amount of gravy on it.

Got this lean cuisine meatloaf and mash potatoes this weekend, and wow, there was a lot of it and very full filling, the whole meal was just enough to eat, did not want anything added to my plate and did not have any seconds after that, some meals will leave you hungry afterwards, but this was a great meal and very delicious, I have a list of lean cuisines on my grocery list from now on, no time to cook it, as it takes so long......I want it just like this from now on it is just like homemade I grew up with and not having the whole day to prepare and fix it...love lean cuisine and on a diet now so this is awesome.

It is very comfort food. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This isn't the best on the go meal I've tried but it tasted fairly good. This product is loaded with sodium so it's not best for high blood pressure people. I would like to see more protein in these frozen dinners. My overall experience with this is if you like quick dinners as you may not have enough time either from working on the job to home life, this would be a good choice. I would recommend.

I was very impressed with the level of nutrition in the meal and found it to be well within reason of what im looking for for a lunch option. The flavor was really good and hearty. My only complaint would be that there aren't many flavor options. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I picked up Lean Cuisine's Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes while shopping for the family groceries. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy and quick it was to prepare.

--------------------
This is by far my favorite lean cuisine frozen meal. There is no comparison to the others! It’s a nice light meal, I always bring it to work because I know it’s something tasty that I can eat quickly, and won’t make me feel gross afterwards. However, it seems Target is the only store that carries it! I hope it’s not being discontinued, I love it!
--------------------
Such a nice and lite dinner. I love the pasta and broccoli mix. Super quick and easy to make , plus it’s a low calorie meal. Will be getting more
--------------------
I love this one the most! I have eaten it about 500 times and still can’t believe it’s only 300 calories. Sometimes I add my own broccoli to it - and it for sure benefits from some black pepper, in my opinion. The only problem is that suddenly I can’t find it ANYWHERE! The usual grocery stores that have it are always missing it for a few weeks now - I actually came here to see if it had been discontinued (please please don’t!). Is there a product locator? Help!
--------------------
I bought this a month ago at my grocery store and i’ve been craving it since but they never have it anymore
--------------------
I thought I would try this for a side dish. It is absolutely without flavor. There is a cheese sauce, but it has no taste, just liquid. Very disappointing Lean Cuisine.
--------------------
...it's just a little bland. Could really use a bit of seasoning or even some bacon bits. Other than that, a good, filling dish. Will buy again (if I can find it...seems to have vanished in my area).
--------------------
The one I just opened had no broccoli in it! I was going to eat this because I needed some vegetables. Not happy!
--------------------
Wasn't my intention to buy, but I am happy I did. Very delicious and I was expecting the "healthy" taste but I didn't, which is a huge plus. It can use a couple more broccoli pieces.
--------------------
Needs more salt and way more broccoli -- the photo is very misleading, there were just two pieces. This was not good. There was a bunch of soupy sauce left over, it was bland, no broccoli....not going to get it again.
--------------------
Wanted to try something new and landed on this as it was on sale. Broccoli was crisp. Pasta was good. Just wish there was a stronger cheese flavor(I prefer sharp cheese while this is more of a mild taste)
--------------------
This meal has a good flavor and a nice balance of sauce, veggie, and pasta. I can only find it at a Walmart Marketplace that is nowhere near me, but I make a special trip there to buy four of these at a time, enough to have one a week for a month. More meals like this, please, Lean Cuisine.
--------------------
This is my favorite meal! I love the cheese sauce and grated cheddar on top. The broccoli adds to it as well. I can eat this daily. I do add some black pepper to enhance the flavor.
--------------------
Not as cheesy as I had hoped, and skimpy amount of broccoli.
--------------------
I've had this product a few times and it's taste great. Down side carb protein ratio needs more balance
--------------------
This is one of my favorite Lean Cuisine meals. It's mac & cheese w/ broccoli, so how can you go wrong!
--------------------
Trying what is new, but not completely satisfied. If you love cheese, you will love this! Cheddar cheese sauce and cheddar cheese together do not seam to mix.
--------------------
This mac n cheese with broccoli is absolutely delicious. The broccoli and pasta are cooked perfectly, there is a crunch to the broccoli, I like that, but it definitely needs more broccoli. It isn't the pasta thats going to keep me full, its the broccoli. I had this for lunch today and added some steamed asparagus. I will buy this again, its priced nicely. The nutritional profile meets my standards for a frozen entree and I plan on trying more, but only the no meat varieties. This entree with a side of broccoli will make a delicious healthy fast easy work lunch.
--------------------
Love the taste but too high in sodium to be considered Healthy
--------------------
Holyy molyy! Real cheese! It's very good broccoli.
--------------------
I bought this yesterday for the first time and was in Heaven eating it. I love the recipe and broccoli and rotini pasta was perfect. I wish Lean Cuisine made more meatless entrees. The first meals that are always sold out are the meatless ones. I would like to see a vegetable stuffed cabbage casserole with rice, cheese, corn, peas, onion, and shredded cabbage.
--------------------
I had high hopes for this product, but I was extremely let down. The meat looked like something you'd find in cat food. The flavors were okay, but it was extremely sweet.
--------------------
I love this meal, but find it very difficult to locate in the stores.
--------------------
I bought two of these today. The box looks the same, but the calories went from 250 to 260. I didn't think anything of it, then noticed that the cooking directions went from 5 1/2 minutes on high without stirring, to cook for 3 minutes on high; stir; then cook for two 2 more minutes. (One reason I loved it was that you didn't have to stir it while cooking). THEN, when stirring it, I noticed it was kind of watery. (Oh well, I've never stirred it while cooking before, so ...) Finally, when it was done, I stirred it again, and it was still watery -- much less beef, less macaroni and watery sauce. Taste test -- not nearly as tangy as before, very bland. What did you do to my favorite frozen diner, Lean Cuisine? Why did you have to mess up a good thing? It's now bland, tasteless, the meat is chewy, the sauce is watery -- no more of these for me. I'll have to find a new favorite now. :'(
--------------------
First time trying this variety and was really pleased. Tastes very good, you really want to eat it.
--------------------
I just tried this for the first time last week. It was excellent. I usually place a bed of raw spinach on my plate and top it with a LC dish. I added a little bit of hot sauce to this and it was perfect. My teenage son even enjoys this.
--------------------
It tastes great but has way too much sugar. It tastes like it has at least 1 teaspoon of sugar in this little container which kind of defeats the purpose of buying Lean Cuisine and also means I have to watch what fruits I eat and what I drink later because this might have just been my full day's allowance in one meal. It was very tasty but I won't buy it again.
--------------------
So I'm pregnant and at a stage where I'm just ravenous all the time. I LOVE lean cuisines for my lunch at work. Today I tried this Macaroni & Beef meal for the first time and I'm so full I'm about to pop. It tastes very very good and obviously very filling. I need a nap now!
--------------------
I know. You were craving THAT can and you looked at the label. You screamed. You wondered how you managed childhood with that. Really. That's gross. But this? It's better than I remembered and it tastes edible. More than edible. And the sodium content isn't as bad as I was expecting for a frozen dinner. On a night when I'm having a severe flare up, this is a really good option because it's that instant shot of protein and okay, macaroni really is comforting. And those chunks of tomato are pretty darn satisfying to bite into. That makes me feel very grown up.
--------------------
Was very surprised how good this one turned out to be. Might be my favorite one.
--------------------
This Lean Cuisine meal is one of my favorites. I always pair it with some microwaved veggies for a filling, nutritious, and comforting meal. This meal tastes very much like my mom's "goulash" tasted and is very much on my comfort-foods list! =) The tomato sauce is tasty, but not highly seasoned. It's a tomato-y, flavorful sauce, without being seasoned to taste Italian or Mexican. (I love both Italian and Mexican cuisine, but this simpler sauce is perfect for this more American-type dish.) The noodles are tender, but not mushy. The meat is tasty and plentiful. I enjoy this simple and scrumptious meal a couple of times a week and highly recommend it. Yum! =)
--------------------
I bought this and I was a little disappointed. I love pasta products...this one was just not what I thought it would be...
--------------------
Tastes fantastic - one of my favorites! Right amount of pasta, I do add a bit of parmesan cheese to finish it off.
--------------------
This reminds me of the macaroni and beef that we had often growing up. It is one of my favorite go to meals.
--------------------
Loved this from the start, great flavor, great portion size.
--------------------
Quick and simple meal for lunch. Good flavor and satisfying.
--------------------
This is my favorite lean cuisine meal. It tastes homemade. I never get tired of eating it ;) P.S, I've lostried over 20 lbs by eating lean cuisine meals for lunch, along with healthy breakfast, snacks, and dinners. It makes lunch time easy.
--------------------
Full of flavour and great for anytime of the day would reccomend to anyone !
--------------------
This mac and beef was very good - that and a big salad - what a great dinner; very satisfying
--------------------
This one is by far my favorite meal. I love the taste and it feels me up. However, I can't seem to find them hardly at any of my local stores so when I go out of town and find them, I stock up.
--------------------
It was very good. I also liked that it was quick and easy to prepare.
--------------------
This is a meal that warms you up. It's a hearty dish that tastes good (could use cheese - I often add my own) and fills you up. Most of their pasta dishes with meat sauce - this one, the lasagna, and the spaghetti w/ meat sauce all taste relatively the same so if you like one you will probably like them all.
--------------------
This is a standby -- tasty basic food. It's not fancy, but a satisfying lunch.
--------------------
This reminds me of the beefaroni my mom used to make when I was a kid.
--------------------
This really warms you up on a cold day. I haven't been able to find it lately, maybe others like it as much as I do! It is a very satisfying meal for me. The flavors are good, I add just a dash of parm cheese to it.
--------------------
It tastes almost like lasagna. But so much better. Reminds me of a meal my mom used to cook.
--------------------
The macaroni and beef was delicious I wish I bought more than one.
--------------------
Great taste just enough to eat. Not too little. It was just right
--------------------
I liked this immediately upon trying it. As a college student, I can say that this is great for study nights. I love it.
--------------------
It was good for my dinner and I only made a veggie and salad to go with it.
--------------------
Love Classic Macaroni and Beef! I add some chili powder and dried onions when I want a spicier dish. I eat this with some raw veggies on the side for a very satisfying lunch.
--------------------
I had one of these entrees for lunch and I couldn't help but notice how spicy it is. I don't remember ever it being so spicy. I like something with less spice.
--------------------
I have yet to get tired of this meal. It has the perfect combination of sauce and meat. The only thing I add is crushed red peppers to it for a little kick.
--------------------
I like beef and mac & cheese so I tried it and does need some salt and pepper and just a little bit of cheese overall a good meal
--------------------
May need a little parm, but overall a great value and good nutrition when I add some unsweetened applesauce or carrots for a side.
--------------------
The best Lean Cuisine meal that I’ve had so far. The turkey tasted good and I was pleasantly surprised by the stuffing and the apples. Great meal for the price.
--------------------
This is my favorite meal so yummy and the apples are amazing so much so I been trying to recreate it to make for Thanksgiving this year
--------------------
I love this meal but am wondering what the nutritional information is without the apples. This meal is 10 SmartPoints on WW and I am trying to figure out the points without the apples - guessing it is much less. Any help is much appreciated.
--------------------
Their new and improved is anything but. I just threw mine out in disgust.
--------------------
I generally have 3 of the roasted turkey per week. The new version is good except the stuffing. It is always dry & crunchy. I follow the directions but nothing like previous recipe.
--------------------
This is thew best tasting Lean Cuisine I've had in a years. It just has turkey, great savory stuffing, and the BEST darn apples I have ever tasted in a frozen meal.
--------------------
This is one of my favorites. The turkey is tasty and tender and the meal is substantive. The apples make you feel like you are having a decadent dessert.
--------------------
I have been eating the Roast Turkey Breast with apples for years. It's my favorite and now the box says new and improved. Why did you have to go and change it? They only difference I noticed was the apples were so bland now. The meal went up in calories and down in taste. So disappointed.
--------------------
My first time buying Lean Cuisine dinner, chose the turkey/dressing and spiced apples. I am on a restricted diet but needed to beef up my protein intake, very good, will definitely do again
--------------------
I bought this within the last week for a quick meal as I love turkey & dressings. I have to say it definitely has lots more flavor and taste than in the past. I added chopped walnuts (I know others can be allergic) and it made a great lunch!
--------------------
The roasted turkey with cinnamon apples was so delicious. But now the package says it's new and improved, and the microwave instructions have changed. The turkey dressing is now oversalted and gummy, I couldn't even eat it. The "new improved" cinnamon apples are now gummy and mushy. Why the change???
--------------------
The taste and texture of the turkey, dressing and gravy is great, however the apples are too sour for my liking. Has the recipe changed? It seems like they used to be sweeter. Now I can't even eat them so the meal isn't enough food for a lunch or dinner.
--------------------
I've tried just about every frozen turkey dinner and this is the first that my husbands liked!
--------------------
Love Lean Cuisine meals but always counted keeping track of the points for my limited diet. I understand it's a marketing issue and Nestle is making more money without the " diet" connection, but at least you could have put it somewhere in the fine print.
--------------------
Well I must say it’s one of the most original tasting meal I’ve had! The turkey was moist, the stuffing was savory as was the gravy. And at the risk of sounding like Ted Mosby from How I Met Your Mother, I like cinnamon! The apples were superb! I’ll be buying more of this meal, providing our store gets them in some more!
--------------------
I started buying these a couple weeks ago and I can?t stop I need to have them every week and they are such low calories it?s amazing!
--------------------
I bought this a couple wks ago Microwaved it for dinner’& it looked like stuffing & gravy was burnt or something yucky!
--------------------
I love this dinner so much I've had like over 3 or so dozen work days in a row!
--------------------
Very tasty, just enough for lunch and easy to fix.
--------------------
The turkey is good, but I LOVE the apples. Wish they would sell these by themselves!
--------------------
LOVE this meal. Turkey, gravy and stuffing like homemade. Apples in a delicious sauce, spectacular. Best frozen meal I have ever had.
--------------------
I am absolutely OBSESSED with the cinnamon apples!!!! Please where can I find a recipe for this?????!!!!!! Or Lean Cuisine please make a frozen dessert with just the cinnamon apples! I've been trying to search the internet for a copycat recipe. No success yet. :(
--------------------
It is the best! I buy this selection in multiples.
--------------------
Top favorite. Seems to be seasonal. Great flavor. Lunchtime perfect. More turkey
--------------------
I am 84 and I only have to fix food for myself. This was just right for me. I loved it . The taste was wonderful. I think I will just buy a bunch of these and not cook so much.. That is if I can afford them. I guess I will have to try and catch them on sale somewhere.. Thanks fo a wonderful dinner..
--------------------
I'm going to buy more of this dinner. 12 characters too short error message????
--------------------
I recently tried this for lunch and it was amazing! Great flavor, meat didn't have any fat on it which is awesome, and the apples with cinnamon were spot on. This is my new favorite Lean Cuisine product!
--------------------
The stuffing on this meal is not prepared. No moisture, dry crumbs and some of it is all stuck together in a mass. Figured it is a fluke...but keeps happening. And there isn't enough gravy. Apples are tasty. Why not skip stuffing and potatoes or squash
--------------------
Used to be great, used to be my favorite, but it's ingredient ratio has changed, now it has way more stuffing and less turkey, so it's mostly empty calories, and does not taste as good.  Since they changed their meat to stuffing ratio, I threw away half of the stuffing. I will look for other brands.
--------------------
I by the one with sweet potatoes and than one with apples. Wish they swap out soggy stuffing with the sweet potates. Also the other one the stuffing is good with the cranberries or whatever is in it. Buy this one only for the apples.
--------------------
Probably the best frozen meal I've ever had ,always sold out at store have the guy hide for me...
--------------------
I eat Lean Cuisine for lunch about 5 times a week. The turkey and apples is my favorite!
--------------------
I've been buying this particular flavor of lean cuisine for YEARS. I just love the flavor. The Turkey may be a meager portion but this is a diet meal. The stuffing can get hard in some spots but what do you expect from a microwave. Some people don't realize that microwaves don't heat very evenly. I just put that stuffing into the gravy and let it sit for a while to get a little mushy. But the APPLES! OMG! I LOVE THE APPLES! I wish they made a side dish of just those. Perfect mix of sweet and tart and the perfect ending to the meal. In my mind that's what makes the meal those delicious apples for dessert!
--------------------
Turkey, gravy, stuffing! what's not to like! Love all Lean Cuisine turkey entrees! not usually a fan of cooked apples but these are good.
--------------------
The turkey and dressing is very tasty. My problem is the apples. I don't like cooked apples so I don't eat them. I'm not asking you to take them out, but for someone who is watching all of my calories, I would love to know how many each item has so that I can get an accurate count. Another example are the meals with the roasted potatoes. I hate them but to get the rest of the meal, there are no other choices. I take them out. Please, somehow, give us some type of way to count the actual part of the meal that we eat and disregard the calories that we don't. Thank you!
--------------------
I enjoyed this particular meal and will purchase again
--------------------
The flavors are wonderful and the turkey is very tender and juicy. But, the apples are WAY too sweet. With 23 grams of sugar in the dish, you could probably cut it in half and they would still be delicious. Overall, I enjoyed the dish.
--------------------
This is my new favorite...love it so much they run out at the store
--------------------
There seemed to be a little more turkey in the meal I had the other night than it usually has. There is some spice in this dish that I really don't like. I'm not sure what it is. the soft pieces of stuffing taste good, but not the hard pieces. I try to skip the gravy. I cook the meat in one bowl and the apples in another, removing all the food from the plastic tray. This is a good quick meal, but it's never enough, so I make half a sandwich and cooked vegatables also.
--------------------
not even close to being a good meal for a person watching there calories, sugar or sodium... this is a joke, right. cut the sugar and salt, maybe add more meat and less gravy and apple goo.
--------------------
I'm at work right now, eating my Roasted Turkey Breast with cinnamon apples. It's my all-time favorite Lean Cuisine meal, and I've had it for about 3 months straight now and I still enjoy it as much as I did when I first started this streak in November. The turkey and stuffing don't taste fake, like some of those other companies. And the cinnamon apples are always a great way to end the meal! Everyone says I'm going to get sick of eating it everyday, but it hasn't happened yet, and I don't see it ending.
--------------------
My favorite LC of all! The turkey dressing & gravy have a great flavor. The baked apples make this for me as I feel like I’m getting a dessert! I add a salad and have a nice balanced meal! the calorie content is low for what you get ❤️‼️
--------------------
Have started my new year resolution to lose weight/become healthier. I tried this entree today for the first time, and have to say it was really good for a frozen microwave meal. I actually enjoyed it alot. Turkey and dressing was good and the apples are a nice finish. Will definately have this one again. The sesame chicken is VERY good too.
--------------------
This is the best Lean Cuisine meal and I eat it a couple times each week. Though I was slightly disappointed to notice when I recently bought several of these that the calorie count has jumped from 260 to 290 even though the weight is the exact same. Where did the extra 30 calories come from?
--------------------
This was always my favorite Lean Cuisine meal, especially since it only had 260 calories in it. Imagine my surprise when I got one out of the freezer and discovered that 30 more calories were now in the meal. Same amount in box - 9-3/4 oz. Everything is the same, except for more calories. WHAT HAPPENED?..
--------------------
This is one of my favorites; however I noticed today the calorie count has changed from 260 to 290, even though package weight is the same. Why the increase? So you've been lying to me?
--------------------
I've eaten this several times, it's really good. The seasoning is great, love the mashed potatoes, although I usually put a little butter and a sprinkle of salt on them, otherwise they'd be a little bland for my taste. The turkey is seasoned good and is tender. The stuffing is ok, but then again, I'm not a big fan of stuffing anyway (unless it's saturated with turkey juices).
--------------------
I love this one, it is the only one I get! However, for the last month or so 9 out of 10 have little pieces of plastic in the apples and NO it is not the plastic cover on the top. These are hard little pieces of plastic. I eat these 5 days a week and honestly it is now just getting to be annoying.
--------------------
Not the best Lean Cuisine meal, it consisted of 70% dressing and almost no actual turkey!
--------------------
I eat this turkey and dressing dish at least 3 times a week. It reminds me of home and satisfies my hunger and sweet tooth. YUMMY IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY LOL
--------------------
Honestly, i dont like tukey Im not sure what compelled me to buy this, but im SO glad i did. The turkey is SO delicous, the gravy is amazing, i love the stuffing.... But the apples. Oh my gosh, the apples. They are the perfect amount of sweet and tart. They should make a dessert dish with just the apples! Omg will buy again.
--------------------
I know I have had this meal in the past, probably a couple of years ago, and enjoyed it. I recently tried it again and it was so foul-tasting, I put it right in the garbage disposal. After one bite, it just left the worst taste in my mouth. I will definitely not buy this one again.
--------------------
This is my favorite. The apples are always yummy. This is one of my staples, when trying to lose a few pounds.
--------------------
I have tried many of the Lean Cuisine line, however, the Roasted Turkey Breast with apples and stuffing is my "All Time Favorite". the seasoning, portion and taste is on point.
--------------------
It's consistent and is our go to dinner. Yes indeed.
--------------------
I tried this 'comfort' variation of turkey breast because I like Lean Cuisine's roast turkey with stuffing, mushrooms and green beans. I was very disappointed. The dish was overwhelmed with rosemary and the turkey portion was skimpy.
--------------------
I may have gotten a bad batch, but mine contained absolutely NO turkey breast whatsoever. There was some stuffing and gravy and plenty of apples, but no turkey. If I could give it less than one star, I would.
--------------------
Best thing since sliced bread!!! Fresh Turkey, gravy and stuffing are great!! The apples are a sure bet for anybody, young and old!! Thanksgiving all over again!!
--------------------
Such a pleasant surprise! I'm not really one for stuffing/dressing but this was so flavorful and delicious and the apples were just spot ON. This was perfect, I'm so glad I decided to try this one and it is definitely going to be one of the ones I look for now.
--------------------
Just ate my first and last. What happened to the potatoes and gravy? Everything was a gummy mess- the sauce for the apples and the gravy.. I also prefer the larger stuffing cubes.
--------------------
Looks good on package, but just like the other one that has stuffing you can't eat it!! The stuffing becomes hard as a rock, and I'm not breaking another tooth on these products again! Yes I said again! I broke a tooth on the french bread pepperoni pizza a few weeks ago; because the bread portion became extremely hard and unable to bite into.
--------------------
This is my go to favorite Lean Cuisine when I'm struggling (really hungry). I love the turkey and stuffing, reminds me of Thanksgiving. Also when I'm craving something sweet the Apples hit the spot!
--------------------
Way Too Much Sodium - Ruins the flavor.....................................................
--------------------
I have been watching my weight for all my life and I really didn't expect much taste when I purchased this for the first time a few years ago. Boy, was I wrong! The turkey is real turkey, not processed and the dressing and gravy is the best that I have ever had in a frozen dinner! So tasty, just needs stirring to moisten it after cooking. But my all time favorite is the apples. Can't say enough good things about them except that I want the recipe so I can make them myself. I would love it if you would make a side dish with just the apples! Yum!!!
--------------------
Very tender turkey, just enough stuffing and gravy. I love the fact that it has dessert with it! It's so easy, pop it in the microwave and voila! If it were on a plate it would be hard to tell it was a frozen meal, cooked in the microwave. Love it!
--------------------
First time trying Lean Cuisine meal - and won't buy anymore! Anyone thinking this is anywhere near good food never ate the real thing. There were only a few small pieces of something that MAY have been turkey hidden in what is called "dressing". And then the cinnamon apples were tasty alright but turned out to be the main course. Yep - the picture on the box got me thinking turkey was in there - get your microscope out while you hunt!
--------------------
I wasn't sure about this because it reminds me of Thanksgiving and I didn't think it would be good! To my surprise this was actually very tasty and spot on!
--------------------
Tried this for the first time at lunch the other day. Wasn't too sure about it but after one bite it's become one of my faves. Like Thanksgiving! The stuffing is very tasty and the apples were good, considering it is, after all, frozen and microwaved. I bought a few more yesterday!
--------------------
I had it today for launch, and there were 2 small pieces of Turkey, soggy stuffing, and not a good tasting turkey. The apples were gross covered with lot of sugar. This has happened the last 2 times. It is disappointing when you expect to enjoy your meal and you just have to throw the rest because it is not edible. Thank you.
--------------------
First time I tried this the sauce from the apples boiled over into the turkey portion, giving everything the flavor of the apples. Now I take out the apples, heat the turkey, and heat the apples separately. Turkey is tender and good quality. Very delicious.
--------------------
Not so pleased with the apples, not a good mix for me, I will stick to the potato side. I wish the side dish had it's own nutritional breakdown, that would help for those who don't eat all off the meal.
--------------------
While I don't have to count every pea or grain of rice in a photo it is hard to avoid the nice looking portion pictured on the package and then find two whole pieces and a series of scraps that don't add up to the other 3 of the 5 pieces shown. Also the apples aren't as fresh looking as shown as they are covered with a heavy sauce. The taste was better than I expected from a microwave meal. Other reviewers love the apples and then tasted good. It was the difference between the photo and quantity of turkey that I was speaking of. I enjoyed a sweet finish to my meal without having to eat a piece of candy or something.
--------------------
I've been trying to lose weight so I was told to try this and I was pleasantly surprised.
--------------------
This is one of, if not, my favorite frozen meal. The turkey is really good, the dressing is not bad, but the soggy dressing ( I always throw them out), needs to be replaced with sweet potatoes without brown sugar, cornbread type dressing, Rice pilaf, or even just more turkey with no carb. The apples are crazy good! I've made two meals just to eat the apples. I've tried to replicate them to no avail. Lean Cusine should make a dessert meal with JUST the apples! Or maybe a low cal cobbler using the same apple recipe. They are the perfect balance of tart and sweet:).
--------------------
I bought a couple of these when I went grocery shopping with my husband the other night, and boy I am glad I picked out this particular flavor! I just had my first one today for lunch, and it was delicious! The roast turkey and stuffing were on par to my liking, and the cinnamon apples were delicious, just the way I like them! I will definitely buying these again!
--------------------
Turkey is no good!!!!!! No Flavor!!! (The F is for Family btw :p)
--------------------
I have been buying this meal for over a year now, and it's one of my favorites. Lately, I have noticed that there are fewer pieces of turkey, less stuffing, and fewer apples overall.What's the deal, Lean Cuisine? Why do some packages seem to have less product than others in the same meal? I still love it,and I plan to buy the 5-7 packages I do now per week.It has helped me to lose 48 pounds within the last year.
--------------------
I was skeptical of this as I don't care for stuffing very much but figured it was a low cal meal so how much could there really be? It had more than expected and was better than I expected. Is it gourmet stuff? No but it's still decent...very herby. I had four decent sized turkey medallions and two smaller ones. It was a decent amount of protein. The apples were good if a bit meager.
--------------------
For an easy 260 calories, it's a great pack and go meal at work. I really just don't like frozen vegetables, so it's great I have one option that isn't straight up pasta or meat with veggies if I want a quick frozen meal to hold me over or replace lunch. I highly recommend it for someone who's pickier. I wouldn't say it's -amazing- but it's one of the best frozen meals I've had.
--------------------
The stuffing/turkey was a little too salty and had a very overpowering sage taste. Apples extremely sweet. 4 tiny pieces of turkey.
--------------------
Tasted horrible! I'm glad I fixed it for myself before I served it to others in my family. I threw it away after a couple of small bites.
--------------------
Turkey was OK, but much to my surprise, the cinnamon "apple" dessert had no apples! Maybe I missed the fine print where it says no apples included...
--------------------
I have been eating this for a long time, I also make a small amount of instant potatoes with skim milk to go with it. Is like a comfort meal but without all the calories. I dump the dressing and turkey on top of the potatoes it delish.
--------------------
I eat TV dinners all the time and this one was just not good the meat was dry not enough scouse and the fruit was a mush not vary happy with its one
--------------------
TO MUCH SALT IN STUFFING!! MINE DID NOT LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE PICTURE
--------------------
Turkey is excellent quality white meat and the stuffing and gravy really hit the spot! The apples are a low cal sweet treat that are a good match with the turkey and stuffing. I have this about once a week for lunch.
--------------------
this meal really satisfies a certain craving without having to do hours of work.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite Lean Cuisine meals. Sometimes you just want good food with no frills. The texture of the stuffing can be a little too mushy or a little too hard or a combination. Overall, the taste of the turkey and gravy and the apples is very good. This is a variety I regularly purchase to keep on hand. One of my favorites.
--------------------
The turkey tastes fresh and is tender and the apples have a nice sweet taste
--------------------
This turkey meal is tasty and straightforward. Especially for being a "diet" meal, it is definitely one to be consumed for either a lite lunch or relatively hearty dinner. Thank you for making a great tasting but sensible turkey meal!
--------------------
Love this product this is my favorite out of all of them.
--------------------
I always buy several of these turkey dinners as well as many of the other Lean Cuisines. I eat these meals every single day for my lunch and my dinner. There is such a variety of different things you can eat. Easy to microwave and they all taste great. You can have any kind from sandwiches to Italian to good old mac and cheese. you name it you can eat it. Whatever you feel like at the time. Great Products
--------------------
It is a little bit of Thanksgiving whenever you want! Love the apples and turkey.
--------------------
When I want a home cooked meat and potatoes meal, I don't always have the time to cook... that's when I reach for this meal... It's so good!
--------------------
I eat this several times per week. Great taste. My absolute favorite Lean Cuisine
--------------------
Turkey is my favorite meat and this is a wonderful combination of turkey and all the fixings!
--------------------
Love this meal and my Kids will also eat this. Makes me feel like Thanksgiving all year.
--------------------
The turkey and gravy is quite tasty and the turkey pretty tender. I love cinnamon apples and rarely get to eat them so I really enjoy having them in this meal. I don't care for the stuffing - it's too dry, but other frozen meals have similar dry stuffing.
--------------------
The turkey is inoffensive - not too dry, not really moist, but it's REAL turkey, not "processed parts" like in other brands of frozen low-cal meals. There's lots of gravy, though I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. The stuffing is dry in parts, soggy in others, but it's got a decent flavour that could use a little more celery to bulk it up. BUT, it's the apples that are KILLER! They're potentially addictive, so I only allow myself this entree twice a week so I don't get burned out on the turkey and stuffing portion. Fabulous!!
--------------------
This WAS one of my favorite Lean Cuisine Entrees. Then they changed the formula and it was just bad.... I can't say what went wrong but the taste was "off". I thought I may have gotten a bad batch so I waited 6 months and tried it once again. The flavor is still bad. I miss the original formula.
--------------------
I LOVE their Vermont White Cheddar Mac & Cheese, so when I saw this at the store I was excited to try it. Big mistake. This stuff is so disgusting. It tastes and smells like vomit, like stomach bile. Its also neon orange??? I do not recommend this product, but I highly recommend their Vermont White Cheddar Mac & Cheese!
--------------------
I don't know if the recipe has changed, but I don't like it at all. The orange color is disgusting (looks nothing like the picture on the box) and the texture is mushy.
--------------------
I have to say that I LOVE Lean Cuisine, but this Mac and cheese tastes awful! I've purchased it twice, the second time thinking that maybe the first one was a fluke and it was just as bad. The Vermont white cheddar Mac is SOOOO much better. This one tastes like cardboard.
--------------------
This product was just plain gross, so bad I got up and spit it out. It was very frothy (whipped looking) the most disturbing color of orange (whoever there that came up with that idea should be fired) and tasted foul. It will be real hard to try a flavor I haven't had before after that experience.
--------------------
I buy this all of the time and I love it! It has a lot of great taste and satisfies my desires for Mac and cheese.
--------------------
This had the worst taste ever. I loved the Marketplace Vermont Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese but Lean Cuisine isn't making it anymore. I could eat that 5 days a week for lunch. But this one tastes so horrible, I couldn't even eat it. Who buys this??
--------------------
I've eaten 3 versions of Lean Cuisine Mac and Cheese. The one in the black box was quite good. The other one in a white box was OK but this version is absolutely horrible
--------------------
Hey, my name is Aleilah and I’m am 13 years old. So with the whole coronavirus going around and the world being on pause, i thought I would go and buy some package foods ;). So I go to the store and go to the frozen section and get your amazing Mac n’ cheese! Then they next day you know I warm it up in the microwave for the time it says to put it in. So I did and it was okay. The cheese texture kind of tasted like grits. But the next day I try it out again because I don’t wanna give up on the Mac n cheese! So I put in the the microwave for 5 minutes because I think maybe the cheese needs to melt more. Then after I take it out I wake a minute or too. After that I start eating it and I realized it was such a nice Mac n’ cheese combo! The noodles were so soft and not mushy or soggy at all! However, the cheese was all melted of course, but the cheese just didn’t seem to fight in with the noodles. But if the cheese was used with American cheese or Mozzarella it would have been perfect! I just giving you guys suggestions so that you guys knows what up! Please don’t feel like I’m dissing your Mac n’ cheese in anyway, I’m just giving you ideas on how to make it better!
--------------------
I finally brought myself to try this... Only when the store was out of the Vermont White Cheddar Mac & Cheese.. Big Mistake-- I've never found myself unable to finish a LC... but I hate to say, after 4 bites, I gave up. NO... Just no.
--------------------
This meal was my replacement for Stouffers after we started eating healthy. Tasted good but my only complaint is that there is too much sauce for the pasta. Sauce is very watery and does not taste like much but the pasta is really good. Have purchased this twice and had the same experience. Would recommend but would recommend to strain the dish after cooking to get rid of some of the excess sauce.
--------------------
This was the most disgusting Mac and Cheese I have ever bought! Looked good on the box, but came out a few elbow macs in a cheese water sauce.
--------------------
Since I've started eating Lean Cuisines to lose/maintain my weight, I've created an unofficial mac and cheese Fridays for myself. Is it sad that I look forward to them? Maybe, but whatever gets me through the day! The orange color was initially a little off-putting, but I've gotten over it and really enjoy this dish. The only times I've had problems with it being lumpy or watery is because the meal defrosted a little too much on my way home from the grocery or on my way in to work. Following the instructions is key as well, but overall I'm very satisfied with this product!
--------------------
No flavor at all, watery orange pasta, disappointed
--------------------
This was probably the worst one I've had of theres so far. Its bland and just not good
--------------------
This has been a go-to for me for years, both as a side to go with baked chicken and green beans and as a quickie "casserole" with a can of tuna. It's not quite so rich as truffle mac & cheese but at a small fraction of the calories and fat, it's a great alternative
--------------------
This has such a great taste. This mac and cheese is probably one of the best I have ever had!
--------------------
i bought this food today cause i was craving mac and cheese and this is so flavorless it taste like water... DONT RECOMMEND
--------------------
I used to buy this years ago and loved it. I recently decided to try it again and I was shocked by the taste difference. I could not taste Macaroni, or cheese, just an taste so off putting it reminded me of paint or plastic. Threw it out after two bites and had to find something else for dinner.
--------------------
Considering that it's frozen and "healthier" than regular mac and cheese it's not bad. There's not much cheese taste and less flavor because of the lower sodium but it's good enough for what it is.
--------------------
So my mom and I are allergic to milk- we can have it in small portions but only fat-free, skim, etc not whole milk...this mac and cheese is a godsend! It doesn't trigger either of our allergies and is so good in a pinch where we have limited options we can eat in tv dinners. I saw the commercial for Vermont white mac 'n cheese on tv just now and was worried my fave got replaced. Please never ever discontinue it!!! If you want real mac 'n cheese try the vermont one instead.
--------------------
I just purchased this mac & cheese, which I have eaten for years, and when I took it out of the box the dish was ORANGE.. I cooked it anyway and when I went to stir, there were brown specs all throughout the dish. Potentially it was burnt before packaged??? I am a huge fan of Lean Cuisine and the no preservatives, great flavor, and high protein, but this was terrible!
--------------------
This is one of my favorites but now that I have eaten your macaroni with broccoli... I’m crazy about that one more so!!! This way I get a great veggie to go along with my comfort food. And the two go great together! Just have a hard time finding it in TX! It was available in FL everywhere! I’ll ask Walmart to stock it here now. I only eat Lean Cuisine meals. You have an awesome selection!
--------------------
The mac and cheese is bright orange ... not it's usual color. What is going on ? Didn't eat it, was scared too.
--------------------
Can't really describe it, but it just tasted bad. I have had other Macaroni & Cheese and this was by far the worst. Was hoping to have lunch This is the first Lean Cuisine product that I have purchased that I was not satisfied with.
--------------------
So I’ve bought this like 3 times because I was desperate for mac and cheese. Worst decision ever. This stuff tastes disgusting! It tastes bland. I checked the ingredients and turns out it only uses cheddar cheese. Are you guys kidding me? What amateur only uses one cheese in their mac and cheese? That’s probably why this stuff is horrible! The only flavor I taste is quite frankly one of the most terrible things I have tasted. I’ve tried to eat it with other things like chicken or garlic bread to add some taste/cover up the flavor of the mac and cheese. Nothing has worked. As a lover of mac and cheese, I’m beyond disappointed in the quality of this. I thought maybe after 3 purchases spread among a few years would’ve given you all a chance to change the recipe. Nothing has changed! Will NOT purchase again.
--------------------
Such a bummer. Couldn’t finish it. It tastes awful!
--------------------
I haven't eaten Lean cuisine in years but I bought a few this past week. I tried this one today and it taste awful. The noodles tasted like plastic and the sauce was creamy but no flavour.
--------------------
I buy Lean Cuisines almost weekly for lunch but this one ended up in the trash after a few bites. I should have taken the neon-orange color and clumps of "cheese" as a warning before trying it. I'll stick with your other products, including the White Cheddar, but please consider a different recipe.
--------------------
I've had this macaroni and cheese many times. It always looks great out of the microwave and has a delicious, creamy taste that I love. I'm so sorry to see that many others don't like this macaroni and cheese. Some other reviewers claimed the recipe changed, which kind of scared me to have this macaroni and cheese again. Thankfully, I enjoyed this again tonight since it still had that great creamy taste to it. This is honestly one of my favorite Lean Cuisine dishes ever and I plan to have more! :)
--------------------
I used to really like the mac and cheese, it was almost like my favorite mac and cheese from another brand but with fewer calories. I haven't had it for a few years, but picked up a few this weekend. I tried to eat one last night and I could only eat a few bites and threw the rest in the garbage! I guess the recipe has changed because this tasted like puke! I'm going to try returning the other mac and cheese I bought to the grocery store.
--------------------
This macaroni and cheese meal hit the spot. It might not be something I grab as often as other meals for the sake of there being less variety in the dish, but I would recommend it for most tastes. There was plenty of cheese in this dish. The consistency was just thick enough and not runny. I do realize frozen macaroni and cheese is hit and miss but I was satisfied with lean cuisine's version.
--------------------
I've been eating this mac and cheese for years. I love how the edges get a little dark and extra chewy when you microwave it a little over the recommended time. I think it's really tasty and satisfying! I'd like to give a shout out to the Lean Cuisine company for being so helpful and accommodating over Facebook when I had a concern. Thank you for great food! I did reviews for the traditional four cheese pizza and the Vermont mac n cheese a couple years ago. I alternate between the three for lunch all the time!
--------------------
Although this Mac and cheese is a bit lackluster in flavor - very under seasoned for being so high in sodium, it is still a go to guilty pleasure for me. It's currently 10:18 and I know it's not good to eat late but I was craving some Mac and cheese and hey at least this is better than some potato chips! I actually enjoy this one - the portion is great size and actually can be savored. Though people say it is clumpy, you REALLY need to stir good. When you first remove from the microwave, it is still a bit frozen - break it up really well and scrape the edges of the container and mix it all together well, then cook remaining time and the clumps are avoided. I do agree with another review that it tastes a bit like pasta water but for the amount of "pasta" you get - I don't think it's that bad! Only improvement I would make it to find where all the sodium is going - decrease it so you have some left to season! Definitely pick this up and give it a try with an OPEN MIND!
--------------------
The cheese is orange and they say it is real cheddar cheese. I have never seen orange cheese of any kinf. IT IS GROSS TO LOOK AT.
--------------------
I buy LC often and find this Mac and Cheese to be very very good! I absolutely love it and for diet food, is very tasty.
--------------------
I bought this product and while it is more healthy than the competitors, the flavor is lacking.
--------------------
I bought this last week and when I opened the package or was orange. Thought I would cook it to see if it changed anything. It was still orange and took a couple bites before tossing it out. I like a lot of your other recipes but but horrible job on this one.
--------------------
I occasionally bought these when I wanted mac & cheese. It was a pale color and was okay. I bought three boxes yesterday and cooked one. When I opened the box I saw this day-glo orange mess. It tastes awful and the cheese sauce clumps together. Looks nothing like the pic on the box. What is Cheddar club cheese? Is this what makes it glow?
--------------------
Where has the oven baked Mac and Cheese gone?? The microwaved ones are absolutely dreadful. Won't be buying them.
--------------------
I thought that the cheese and mac was very good considering it is a low calorie frozen meal. The cheese was creamy but it was not overpowering. Most frozen meals the pasta is mushy but this was not. I enjoyed it very much.
--------------------
The sauce tasted grainy and was not smooth and creamy like I had hoped
--------------------
I just had this for dinner tonight and it was too rich/salty and the cheese sauce was clumped/lumpy. I liked the mac & cheese that came with the Salisbury Steak meal more. This also took 2 minutes longer than the suggested time, which is weird to me because all the other meals I have had were timed perfectly. I couldn't even finish it. I will not be buying this one again.
--------------------
I purchased this product because I had been satisfied with some other Lean Cuisine products. But I was terribly dissapointed! This meal was completely tasteless! I have never experienced something like this. I tried to add salt, but it did not help. I hate throwing food away, but I had to do it with this one...
--------------------
I used to think it was pretty good! Now I find it inedible! Disgusting! I threw it out!
--------------------
I like almost all of your products but did something change with the Mac and cheese? It's dayglow orange! It doesn't even taste like cheese. I had to add shredded cheese to it just to make it edible but the color is very off putting. I won't be buying it again. It just can't be good for you at that unnatural color of orange.
--------------------
Purchased the Mac and cheese since they were on sale but multiple boxes I attempted to eat tasted awful. The mac and cheese had an orange color and tasted really bad. Had it throw it out after a few bites every time. Expected better from Lean Cuisine products.
--------------------
I'm surprised by all the negative reviews. I was scared to try it because of all the negative feedback but I'm glad I did! It was very good and you get a lot! It fills me up! There's not a ton of cheesy flavor but it didn't taste bland to me at all as a lot of other people are saying. Give it a try!
--------------------
I love the regular Stouffer's mac & cheese & tried this as a lower-calorie alternative. Fell short of my expectations.
--------------------
The Macaroni and Cheese is so good. I am trying to eat healthier so I decided to try Lean Cuisine again. This Macaroni and Cheese does not disappoint. It is very creamy and I can eat it without feeling guilty. Thank you Lean Cuisine.
--------------------
I've bought this a couple of times and it is just so bland. It literally has no flavor. I've tried adding even more salt and pepper or even hot sauce and it just doesn't taste any better. I love lean cuisine products, just not this one! The White Mac n Cheese from Lean Cuisine is much better, but not as filling.
--------------------
I've been a fan of macaroni and cheese for years. This is probably one of the best macaroni and cheese products today along with the Vermont White Mac & Cheese also made by Lean Cuisine. I haven't tried Stouffer's mac and cheese yet, though I have had many mac and cheese products(such as Kraft mac & cheese and Velvetta) that have more fat and calories than this one, but they tasted rather bland. This product, on the other hand, has a creamy cheddar cheese sauce with a nice, smooth taste. It doesn't quite have as much cheddar cheese flavor as I would have preferred, but it does have more flavor than the products I mentioned earlier. The pasta is nice and tender, and it cooks nicely in the sauce. Overall, this is a really good meal and I recommend giving this a try.
--------------------
I LOVE this mac and cheese! I read quite a few negative reviews here on the Lean Cuisine site, so I wasn't sure if I would like this dish. I am a mac and cheese addict! I used to regularly eat Stouffer's mac and cheese, but in the past few months, I've been striving for portion control and reducing my sodium intake. Lean Cuisine helps me to easily stay on track. I tried this LC mac and cheese, and to my happy surprise, it was DELICIOUS! The pasta is cooked perfectly; not gummy or too soft. The sauce is creamy and has just the right amount of cheddar tang. There is less sodium than you'd find in Stouffer's or restaurant mac and cheese, but it is not bland. If you're not limiting your sodium, you'll probably sprinkle on a touch of salt, but even without it, this is still a delicious and satisfying meal! The ultimate comfort-food! If you've been hesitant to try this dish because of negative reviews, definitely give it a try! I'm so glad I did! =)
--------------------
My normal brand of frozen Mac and cheese I buy was not available at the store today. I decided to go with Lena cuisine as I have liked some of their meals. I like the noddles but the cheese sauce just well it tastes weird. I have had worse, but I probably won't buy this again.
--------------------
I love how cheesy the Macaroni & Cheese is. The cheese taste fresh and its the prefect consistency. The noodles cook really well as well. The noodles aren't hard or too mushy. Overall its a great meal!
--------------------
I love this product! I have been eating it for years. Can't do without it:)
--------------------
I've been trying different Lean Cuisine selections and have really found them to be quite tasty, with the exception of the Mac and Cheese. It looked very appealing to me - creamy (even after a few minutes) and cheesy-looking. Very disappointed that it had no taste whatsoever. I tried to add a little salt but that didn't help. Tried to finish it but couldn't eat more than a few spoonfuls.
--------------------
Normally Lean Cuisine is pretty good but this cheese-like mess was gross. I was so hungry when I can home from work that I nuked it and started to eat it - it tasted like chemical cheese with a waxy feel. I actually wanted to throw it up and get it out of me. I brushed my teeth but I could still remember the taste. Needless to say I will never buy this again.
--------------------
I buy a ton of frozen meals, as i usually take them to work with me for lunch. I love MacnCheese and have tried tons of different brands and types. This is easily the worst MacnCheese I have ever had - a generous portion size, but completely flavorless. It was very strange because the texture is right, but there is nothing going with it. Definitely skip purchasing this one!
--------------------
Tried this tonight. Absolutely was disappointed in the meal and the recipe and quality. Don't waste your money. Other varieties are better from lean cuisine. Mac and cheese is my favorite but this was so disappointing
--------------------
I didn't like it. I gave it a fair rating (2 stars) because it tastes like what you expect it to taste like. & I hear nobody really likes frozen Mac & Cheese so.... If you like frozen Mac & Cheese or the Mac & Cheese at Old Country Buffet you will like Lean Cuisine's. But if you don't you should try another Lean Cuisine meal. Lean Cuisine has many other cheesy pasta options. You're sure to find one that suites your tastes.
--------------------
It is one of my favorites. Easy to make and delicious too.
--------------------
Macaroni and cheese is one of my comfort foods. Lean Cuisine helps to enjoy my comfort foods without the fat and calories.
--------------------
Full of the all the cheesy flavor you want without all the fat. A great pick!
--------------------
This mac n cheese was average. It wasn't exceptional but it was good and I'd probably purchase it again. Tastes like the product you'd buy at a deli or premade at the grocery store. Heated up easily, added salt + pepper to taste and had a decent lunch.
--------------------
This is my go to simple vegetarian meal. A little tabasco sauce and black pepper perfect. Add a salad and done.
--------------------
Very good and creamy Macaroni and cheese. Good flavor.
--------------------
I could eat this everyday , I love the cheesy taste and sometimes I overcook cuz I like it crusty .It is one of my favorite meals!
--------------------
I use this as a quick and delicious side dish whenever I'm in a hurry or can't decide what to have.
--------------------
I love to mix in some cooked zucchini or green chiles and make this really healthy.
--------------------
This is decent mac and cheese. Other brands are better
--------------------
I normally make my own homemade mac and cheese, but I was looking for something convenient and healthier. I found just what I was looking for with Lean Cuisine Macaroni & Cheese meal. It tastes great and this is my new go-to meal. My only regret is that I didn't buy two meals when I was at the store!
--------------------
I really do like this mac but I wish there was MORE and maybe a little crunchy goodness.
--------------------
I though this Mac and cheese was actually pretty good for being a freezer meal!
--------------------
This is my go to for comfort food. It is as if I made a pot of mac and cheese at home. My big problem is portion sizes, so this is the perfect blend and size.
--------------------
Bought this today and really didn't like it. Not much flavor at all and it's very bland. I'll stick with the Vermont cheddar kind.
--------------------
Havent eaten a couple different products at home/friends/family, as well as some coming already prepared (deli etc), but this is the one i coudnt eaten more than 2 spoons before throwing it out. I know neste products since the late 70s, and understand there is a difference between products sold in europe/swiss vs over here, but this i the first time i not only dont like the taste, but it being so awful was a surprise. Not even talking about the large amount of sodium...
--------------------
The container broke into pieces in the microwave even though I followed cooking instructions. I've never not liked mac n cheese and this was pretty bad.
--------------------
It's really not bad- I don't NOT enjoy it, but between this and their VT cheddar version, I'll always take the VT cheddar.
--------------------
I bought it as kind of a cheat lunch, was pretty good. I added a piece of fish to it for some protein
--------------------
I really don't mind the taste. I don't expect much out of it because it's diet food but every time I eat it it's like I'm eating bits of sand. There is something crunchy in this stuff. I thought maybe I got a bad box but it's in every LC Mac and cheese I buy. Please look into this.
--------------------
I love this macaroni & cheese. It's creamy and cheesy and if you slightly overcook it, the crisp edges taste good too!
--------------------
I was looking for the regular macaroni and cheese which I really like, but our stores are not stocking it regularly so I chose this option instead. There was very little flavor and I was sooo disappointed. I thought the portion size was a bit small, but I ended up not finishing it because it tasted so bad. I will NOT buy this product again.
--------------------
I loved the creamness of the cheese. It was a meal that tasted so good and filled me up. I will be adding this one to my list also.
--------------------
I love that I can get my Mac and Cheese fix when I'm craving it!
--------------------
I was shocked they even carried Mac N Cheese for the fact...let's face it...mac n cheese is fattening. So this was one of the first things I grabbed from the freezer. It didn't have much taste. I'm shocked it had so much sodium because I couldn't taste any salt at all. I loaded it down with pepper and dug in anyway. You have to take the good with the bad when it's only 300 calories.
--------------------
This meal is creamy but lacks a lot of "cheesy" flavor. Love the new white cheddar Mac. The pasta is way too soft.
--------------------
I bought this in 2003 because a friend had suggested to me, and I have been eating it ever since!
--------------------
A healthier way to get a mac and cheese fix when you need it.
--------------------
I found it a bit bland but with other foods it made a nice side dish
--------------------
Oh man, I love cheese and this product was just awesome! It was so cheesy and delicious. 2 thumbs up!
--------------------
This is definitely not one of Lean Cuisines best meals... It's very bland, no taste. They could definitely make some adjustments to this dish.
--------------------
A fast and healthy lunch hour meal .thick and creamy.easy to make
--------------------
This is great not just for a meal but also to serve as a side as well. Super creamy.
--------------------
Pasta was a good texture and tenderness which i've had problems with with previous frozen mac & cheese. The sauce melted nicely, but was missing something. It was just a hint of cheddar. It wasnt too bad. I'd buy it again if there was a big selection.
--------------------
I like the original Macaroni and Cheese. It is very creamy and delicious and I hope they continue to make this great tasting dish.
--------------------
The amount of cheese needs to be increased as tastes a bit weak.
--------------------
Good as a side dish, it is consistently dependable; the kids like that.
--------------------
OK - somewhat satisfies Mac & Cheese craving without the calories.
--------------------
I had high hopes, but this fell flat. No flavor, watery mac and cheese. Very Disappointed.
--------------------
Lean Cuisine gets the job done when it comes to their Mac & Cheese (as well as all their other products). In the 26 years of my life, I've had a good amount of Stouffer's Mac & Cheese. I know the taste! I've been eating Lean Cuisine for years and every time I've had their Mac & Cheese, I've always been like, "hmm....man, it tastes similar to Stouffer's". It wasn't until today that I actually did a quick research(Wikipedia of course) looked up both companies, and found out that they are under the Nestle umbrella. So basically, Lean Cuisine is the healthier version of Stouffer's, which is awesome. If that's the case, Lean Cuisine's Mac & Cheese is mostly likely a some-what healthier version of Stouffer's Mac & Cheese. They do a good job at keeping it healthy without jeopardizing flavor. If you want to enhance the flavor a little without turning their healthy dish into an unhealthy dish, add a little black pepper and some Italian seasoning.
--------------------
Thank you for going back to the original recipe about the rice, poblano peppers & corn in a sour cream sauce.!!! Back to buying this dinner again.
--------------------
Thank you for returning to the original recipe! I truly enjoy the poblano pepper, corn, and sour cream sauce with the fish fillet. This has always been my favorite Lean Cuisine entre.
--------------------
Unfortunately, I have a sensitive digestive tract and therefore have trouble finding quick lunches for work. Your tortilla crusted fish was a dish I could tolerate. Until now. Something about the new sauce makes me sick. Maybe more dairy than before? Definitely more sauce & I agree with another post that the fish crust gets soggy. Please go back to the original recipe! (Same issue with Sesame Chicken -what changed?)
--------------------
Mine also stunk up the kitchen, the sauce tasted somewhere from bitter to just plain awful. I felt sick the rest of the evening............ I totally loved the old formula. Also loved many of the new bowls, except the ones with spicy sauce. I eat Lean Cuisine daily.
--------------------
This was my favorite Lean Cuisine dish until you "improved" it a few months ago. I hated the new version and so I reluctantly quit buying it. But today my wife found packages advertising "Original Recipe!" She snapped up every one of them. PLEASE tell me you've decided to go back to the original recipe permanently. Then I can have my favorite back!
--------------------
This has always been my favorite Lean Cuisine entree. But this new recipe is not good. The sour cream sauce was so much better. The lime and cilantro is too strong, has a bite and does not complement the fish.
--------------------
I loved the tortilla crusted fish until it was "improved." The intense lime flavor that was added does not enhance the dish. And I really like lime! I live in the southwest and have eaten a wide variety of southwestern and Mexican dishes, yet have never encountered anything like this.
--------------------
I didn’t realize this was an update until I tasted it and wondered why it tasted different. Definitely not a good improvement. Original was much better. Will not purchase this version again.
--------------------
This used to be my go-to frozen meal before the recipe was changed. It used to have a creamy, cheesy flavor with a hint of peppers but now it just tastes like mustard. I really hope you go back to the previous recipe because I can’t buy it anymore. No need to improve on something that was already delicious.
--------------------
I literally just finished eating this dish, and its the new version. I cooked it as per the directions(uncovering the fish). I thought it was absolutely delicious! It has a very slight spiciness to it, the fish was flavorful and crisp, and the side with sauce was creamy and scrumptious. I'm on a low salt diet as well, and Lean Cuisine has quite a variety of dinners that have a reasonable sodium content. Thank you!
--------------------
I have purchased this dinner multiple times in the past. On this particular occasion I found sharp pieces of plastic inside of the fish. I was horrified because I had ate a lot of the fish. Now I am concern exactly how much of the plastic was inside of the fish. Please be careful when purchase this product.
--------------------
I use to buy Tortilla Crusted Fish in quantities of 6 at a time. I noticed it said New and improved. My personal preference is the original. I will not be buying this one in the future. The fish is good but the spices and lemon/sour flavor is not good.
--------------------
This used to be one of my favorites. But the "New and Improved" formula is terrible. The flavor of the rice is too strong and ruins the whole dish. Very disappointed.
--------------------
This used to be my favorite Lean Cuisine meal to take to work for lunch. I hadn't had one in awhile so I bought a couple and saw it was a new recipe. I prepared one for dinner and I had to throw the rice away - it not only looked very unappetizing (slimy looking) but it tasted awful! The fish was edible but not as good as it used to be. Why ruin a perfectly good product?
--------------------
I also prefer the original .It was my favorite meal. The new one is too spicy.
--------------------
This has been my go to frozen entree for several years, I always kept several in the freezer, and I particularly liked the flavors of the rice side that it was served with. So last time I shopped I bought 3 of the new and improved version, and what a disappointment. The fish wasn't as crispy or fresh tasting, and the rice recipe was totally different, the good flavors were gone and replaced with something spicy that was too hot for me ... what is this latest trend with replacing flavor with heat? I'll probably throw away the other two and look for a different "go to" meal.
--------------------
So disappointed with the new flavor. The old flavor was fine. There was no need to "improve" it. Now it tastes too vinegary or lemony. I used to eat it 4 or 5 times a week, but probably won't buy it again.
--------------------
The original recipe was so good. My Mom and I used to buy them frequently. Then the recipe changed and it's horrible. The sauce used on the rice tastes like dirty mustard socks. It leaves a film in your mouth that's hard to get rid of. Too bad Lean Cuisine messed with a good thing! We won't be buying this new recipe anymore. Miss the old....was very tasty.
--------------------
This has been one of my favorites for years. The new ingredients are way to spicy and have ruined any underlying fish or sauce flavors. Please change back.
--------------------
I have purchased the Tortilla Crusted Fish for years and loved it. This new and improved is horrible. I am not a fan of lime and the lime taste in this is overwhelming. Also the rice is not the same consistency as the old version. It was all I could do to eat it, but it was the only thing I had brought to work for lunch. I will not be purchasing this anymore unless it goes back to the old recipe!
--------------------
Old version was way better. New version tastes like I’m eating a bar of soap.
--------------------
This has always been a go-to for lunch. It has changed; less rice, more sauce, different flavor - more cilantro? I preferred it before these adjustments.
--------------------
The ORIGINAL Marketplace Tortilla Crusted Fish with sour cream sauce was AMAZING!!! Then it was just recently replaced with a 'New & Improved' version that is absolutely awful! The new cilantro sauce is so overpowering it even ruined the flavor of the fish. I literally threw the whole thing into the garbage disposal.
--------------------
This was one of my favorite Lean Cuisine meals when it had a sour cream sauce. Now they have "improved" it with a lime and cilantro sauce and I hate it. Much too sour. Won't be buying this one anymore unless they go back to the old recipe.
--------------------
Just not. Terrible change.
--------------------
you thought you were making it better. It's no where near being as good now that you've made changes.
--------------------
Used to love this but the new rice is awful. Too much lime. I prefer the old creamier sauce. I have discovered that "new and improved" never is is improved. Go back to the old rice, please.
--------------------
This was my favorite lean cuisine meal. It was 5 stars in my opinion. Now it tastes awful. Please go back to original recipe.
--------------------
the fish is as good as ever....was one of my very favorites. and I used to enjoy the cheesy sauce on the rice. now the sauce is so bitter and sour. i hate the flavor so i threw it out.
--------------------
Been eating this for a couple of years, especially during lent, and I wish you would change back to the other rice.
--------------------
I’ve been looking forward to eating this all week and it was such a disappointment! Atlees it leaves a weird aftertaste in your mouth I don’t like the new seasonings and the rice looks and tastes very unhealthy… Just a gooey sauce. :(
--------------------
It's a well-portioned piece of fish (a little larger than a "tender"), and the rice/corn/pepper mixture is great. The new version is a little more lime-flavored, but still a good lunch meal (especially compared to what I don't have time to throw together in place of it). It's a great taste and is filling. I should point out that I love fish and I love corn - so that drove me to try it. Sodium is always a concern, but I could do worse with many other lunch options. Compared to many frozen meals I've tried out, this is worth a try!
--------------------
This was always one of my favorites; I ate it weekly. Not anymore. They changed the fish somehow, can't pick up on what they did, but the flavor is off. The rice is yuck! I just loved the old rice, and this new one is a bit spicier, has a more sour flavor, and overall just is not a good flavor. :(
--------------------
This dinner is probably the least available and hard to get at least in my area. It is also my favorite always great flavor and nice sized portion. I tried the New and Improved not impressed. The fish was same but the rice dish was too spicy. I enjoyed the rich creamy sauce of the old rice.
--------------------
I used to enjoy your Tortilla Crusted Fish, but this new & improved dish is more like a new & terrible flavored rice dish. This dish used to get 4+ star reviews, but now it's getting terrible reviews and I'm in that camp. Why change something that is good? I will no longer be puchasing this because the new flavor is terrible.
--------------------
In the “new and improved” version, the crust on the fish is soggy and the sauce is laden with cilantro. Also, the fish in the original product was wild caught pollock. The fish in the “new and improved” product is not identified. I will no longer purchase this product.
--------------------
This isn't good since they changed it. I love the non-GMO organic version in the black box. This has soggy fish and tastes funny. I doubt if I'll buy this new version again
--------------------
The previous version of this meal was my all time favorite LC meal. I would get multiple boxes and always have at least one or two per week for lunch. Now, this meal is hardly edible. The flavors are not complementary. The fish quality has suffered. PLEASE return to the old recipe!! TY! A loyal, long-time fan.
--------------------
This was my absolute favorite lean cuisine but it has recently been updated and a bunch of sauce has been added. Now I'm always on the hunt for the stores who haven't sold out of the old one yet. I'm gonna miss eating this.
--------------------
Who decided to change this recipe? The sauce tastes sour now. It may be new but it’s definitely not improved. Bring back the old recipe!
--------------------
This used to be one of my favorite Lean Cuisine meals. The new recipe for the rice is very disappointing.
--------------------
I noticed that something tasted different about the rice and fish (especially the rice), so I decided to inquire on the Lean Cuisine website to see if anything was noted on a new recipe. After reading others' comments on this dish, I see that other people had the same sentiments I have about disliking the new recipe. Please bring back the original recipe. I used to thoroughly enjoy the old recipe which was a daily meal for me. I will no longer purchase this new product. The rice taste too tart and spicy and the fish isn't what it used to be either.
--------------------
I used to love this dish! I eat one of your fish entrees every night for dinner...switching off and on between this one and the Parmesan Crusted Fish! Looks like now I'll be down to just one fish meal unless you take the Tortilla Crusted Fish entree and return the RICE mixture to its original GREAT taste! Because your "new and improved" recipe SUCKS!!! Why can't you people learn to leave well enough alone??!!! A couple of years ago, you took away my Lemon Pepper Fish altogether! I used to love that meal as well. Keep it up and you'll lose this customer for good!!
--------------------
This was one of my favorite meals but the new formation has ruined it. The sauce is so soupy, that is what it should be called. Gross!
--------------------
This was one of my favorite Lean Cuisine meals. The picture on the new box looks the same as before, but the rice doesn't look the same. Nor taste the same. It is too spicy for me, burned my tongue for nearly 30 minutes after eating. And the smell in my kitchen was awful and lasted for hours. Even the tray smelled awful even after washing it. I'll eat the other one in my freezer, but alas I have to find another tasty fish dish. You also changed the sauce in the glazed chicken a few years and I don't buy that anymore either. As the old saying goes, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." Very disappointed.
--------------------
This meal was one of my favorites for years. I won't ever purchase it again now that it was changed to the creamy cilantro sauce. I love cilantro, but the sauce is so strong I barley ate it. The fish is still good, but with only enjoying half of the meal, I sadly won't buy it again. :(
--------------------
I used to love this dish but the new and improved is not good. The fish was OK but soggy on the bottom. The rice side was horrible! It tasted like it had a ton of vinegar in the sauce. I always loved this one but I will not buy this tortilla crusted fish again. PLEASE go back to the old recipe!
--------------------
Why are you guys changing everything? The spaghetti now the fish? Please go back to the sour cream sauce it’s so much better. Not the kinda sauce I want with my fish.
--------------------
I loved the previous version of this I would purchase all the time. But last week at the store all they had was the new improved so I bought thinking it would be similar. I was wrong. I wish I can return for my money back.
--------------------
This was my fave Lean Cuisine meal. I usually ate one, sometimes two a week. But I am not happy with the new and improved entree. I have tried it twice with the same result. The fish is still awesome, hence the two stars, but in my opinion, the new rice side is not. I loved the sour cream sauce with poblano peppers! And I am a fan of lime/cilantro, but there’s something off with this blend. It is too saucy and leaves an odd aftertaste. The sauce also takes away from the crispness of the fish. Sadly, I will not be purchasing this one anymore. I’d love to see the previous sour cream/poblano blend return!
--------------------
What happened to the sour cream sauced flavored one? It was perfectly fine the way it was! Now, I'm only finding the ones with cilantro and lime. It is super heavy herb taste that makes me need to wash it down with water. Ew. Please bring back the old formula.
--------------------
This used to be a favorite...It says new and improved but all I taste now is cilantro..yuck.
--------------------
This has been one of my favorites for years. Unlike others, I didn't mind the rice portion and the fish is still very good. That being said, the pablano peppers were my favorite part of the rice and I wish they were added again, as it gave the meal an extra bit of flavor before.
--------------------
In March I tried this fish entree with rice and corn side. The slightly crispy fish was delicious and so was the rice side. So, in April I bought the "new, improved" Tortilla Crusted Fish with a creamy cilantro lime sauce. Not good!! I think there is too much sauce, and it's a little too strong on lime and cilantro. Also, since the fish is not separated from the rice mix, the sauce makes the fish soggy. May I suggest returning to the original recipe. And, have you thought of using "riced" cauliflower with corn and red/green peppers? As a senior woman I enjoy healthy and tasty Lean Cuisine meals that I can add a salad or steamed broccoli. Keep it simple and enjoy life.
--------------------
I’ve recently purchased my favorite lean cuisine the tortilla crusted fish. The package has changed and box states new and improved. If the improvement is the cilantro lime sauce in the rice please go back to the creamy sour sauce. The cilantro lime sauce is horrible. I won’t be buying it again.
--------------------
i've been getting these for awhile now, did the whole shopping pick up for the first time and forgot i had this in my cart. got home with my groceries and didn't noticed the new and improved sticker til i grabbed this out of my freezer tonight. the fish is small but it's SO good. and it was sorta crisp for the first time. i like this and will be getting more, just wanted to say whatever y'all did. thanks!
--------------------
I've been a fan of the tortilla crusted fish for quite sometime but the new & "improved" entree added an overpowering citrus flavor to the rice which isn't appetizing! Thankfully the fish is still delicious!
--------------------
The old recipe featured a delicious cream sauce. The new recipe features a tangy lime-based sauce that leaves a bad aftertaste that lasts for hours. Why completely change the nature of the recipe?
--------------------
I'm so sad. I used to love this one. The new recipe is not nearly as good.
--------------------
Directions say remove film over fish before cooking. Look at the picture on the box: that's what it looks like inside. How do you remove the film just over the fish??
--------------------
The Tortilla Crusted Fish used to be one of my favorite entrees. However, the one I bought this weekend boasting "New and Improved" was anything but. It left a bad aftertaste in my mouth. The fish tasted old even though expiration date is Apr 2021. I have my few go-to entrees that I enjoy so was very disappointed by this change. I would recommend Lean Cuisine in general, but not this particular dish anymore.
--------------------
I don’t know why you changed the recipe. Rice and corn do not taste good.
--------------------
What did you do to the rice? Smells like you added vinegar. Fish is good if you can scrape the rice flavor off. Bring back the old. I just bought 5 of this fish and I'm angry and disappointed.
--------------------
Lean Cuisine changed the recipe to "new and improved" on this frozen dinner. This frozen meal used to be one of my favorites but the new and improved version is terrible. They should go back to the old version.
--------------------
Tried the new and improved tortilla fish and new and improved I think now. I hated it. I ate the fish but the rice was just a spicy soup which I ended up throwing away . I did not like the taste. Sorry
--------------------
I really enjoyed the fish, I've bought it many times. Sadly, I not a fan of the rice mixture. Might be good with some mac and cheese.
--------------------
I love the fish part of the meal but because the fish itself has such great flavorings in it it leaves of rice Bland. So because of the rice alone I cannot recommend this meal. If it wasn't for the Bland rice I would give this 5 stars and recommend this fish meal to people...
--------------------
This is one of my favorite meals. The stores where I was buying it from stopped carrying it! But by coming on here I found out where to get it!!
--------------------
This is my favorite Lean Cuisine meal. I just add some Mexican and chile lime seasonings to both the fish and rice and have a super yummy low cal meal.
--------------------
This is another go to meal for me. Helps me get my fish in and does not smell bad. It's very flavorful. I'd like to see a slice of lemon on the top of the filet. Sodium content is below 500mg's. Thank you.
--------------------
This was surprisingly good for a frozen meal. Not too much breading. Good flavor. The rice is really good.
--------------------
I really enjoy this one! Out of all of the lean cuisines I’ve had it’s been my absolute favorite. The flavor is there and the smell is amazing. Highly recommend this one if you love fish.
--------------------
Best tasting frozen fish meal ever! Yummy fish. Rice is flavorful. Portion is just right!
--------------------
I’ll admit, I was skeptical buying a fish frozen dinner. I was blown away! It was delicious and now I wish I had bought more. It was filling and full of flavor!
--------------------
Love this entree but wish the fish and rice were not thrown together in the same container.
--------------------
Have been having this delightful fish & rice meal for almost a year! Never disappointed! My go-to favorite for Fridays at home.
--------------------
One of the best yet. Slowly working my way thru all the many choices. Down 26 pounds!!!
--------------------
JUST ENJOY LEAN CUISINE - TORTILLA CRUSTED FISH! SO HAPPY IT BACK STORE! THANK YOU
--------------------
Excellent fish -- just wish the rice was BROWN rice!
--------------------
I absolutely LOVE this dish. I buy this one often.
--------------------
I tried this because I love fish. I am not fond of rice but, this "mexican" style with the poblano and corn and the ever so creamy sauce was just amazingly wonderful! I wish I could just buy a whole bowl of it!!
--------------------
I buy this dish whenever I see it in my store. Fish is good tasting, and rice makes a wonderful side! Just right for lunch at the office.
--------------------
I tried this for the first time today and it was really good! I was skeptical to try it because I am picky about fish but glad I decided to after reading the great reviews. I was expecting "mushy" crust from the sauce over the rice but it was slightly crisp after letting it set for a few minutes before eating. This will be one of my regular weekly buys.
--------------------
this is my favorite Lean Cuisine. The fish is very tasty. I feel very satisfied with this meal. I do add a second side dish to make this more filling.
--------------------
I've started eating this meal once a week. Very good.
--------------------
This is the best marketplace meal I have tried to date. It was very flavorful. I tweaked the cooking time to 5 minutes and added salt. It was DELICIOUS. I look forward to purchasing this in the future and incorporating it to fit into my busy lifestyle.
--------------------
This was actually quite good! Even though my fish did not come out crispy as other reviews have noted, I still thought it was quite delicious. The fish was flakey and tender on the inside and the rice was a great complement. I would buy this again!
--------------------
I have been eating this meal 1-2 a week for about a year and I cannot get bored of it! Love it and I look forward to eating this each time.
--------------------
I eat this meal often. I love the flavor of the rice and the fish crisps up good.
--------------------
Sauce on rice was good, just not enough of it. Few vegetables cooked ok.
--------------------
I bought this a couple of weeks ago as I was looking for some new frozen meals to try out for lunch. I was very pleasantly surprised by this great tasting dish. The fish was crispy and the rice mixture tasted wonderful. Definitely will become a go to meal for lunch in the future.
--------------------
I bought this not expecting much because I haven't really been a huge fish lover, but this is INCREDIBLE!! I love the taste and the crispy -ness of the fish! My favorite lean cousine. I am in college so finding something like this that is healthy-ish and fast is a must-have!!! Super good:)
--------------------
Have been eating this meal for a long time. Really nice fish fillet, rice is good too, although I substitute broccoli and corn for most of the rice, and it makes a nice combination and more nutritious.
--------------------
I like the flavor, just wondering because it's tortilla crusted, is it fried or is it baked and just appears like it's fried?
--------------------
I was very skeptical to try this meal... frozen microwaveable fish did not appeal to me at all! But a friend raves about it so I gave it a shot. The fish cooks surprising well! I rarely eat Lean Cuisines straight out of the box (they need a little spice), so I added a bit of hot sauce and some diced avocado to the rice and it was perfect.
--------------------
I love this product. Not a big fish eater, usually, but have not been seeing this in my local grocery stores and am hoping it's not being discontinued! I love this dish!
--------------------
Really good quick and easy meal. Not a huge meal certainly but filling. I might add some corn next time.
--------------------
I bought this dinner and the quality was not good. So many dark areas in what is supposed to be white fish, and very strong tasting. Very dissapointing.
--------------------
This is amazing! The crust was crunchy and I love the fish. There is nothing to complain about. Other than I don't have any more in my freezer.
--------------------
Many of the websites I looked on listed this particular Lean Cuisine as being very good. I decided to give it a try based on those findings. I was really disappointed. I don't know how they could say this is one of the best Lean Cuisines out there when it clearly wasn't for me. The fish was a bit mushy and was crusted with what tasted like nacho cheese Doritos. It just didn't seem to taste good. The flavor profiles didn't seem to mesh well for me. Of course I'll be honest I don't eat fish tacos either! So I guess maybe if you're a fish taco lover you may like this flavor, it just wasn't my cup of tea.
--------------------
Flavor was just fine, but the texture of the noodles was not good. Noodles were completely over cooked.
--------------------
I love this meal! I am on weight watchers and love Mac and cheese. This meal is so satisfying and it keeps me full for hours. I will continue to enjoy this meal once I reach my goal weight. It doesn’t have a “diet” flavor but tastes like a delish dish of Mac and cheese!
--------------------
I tried this on a whim because I've never had really good frozen mac & cheese. I was so surprised and went back the next day and bought 6 more. It tastes so fattening. I just hope the calories listed are right.
--------------------
Not as good as their previous recipe for the Marketplace (black box) version. Cheese is more watery with cheese powder clumps.
--------------------
I love mac and cheese just like many others. I really enjoy this mac and cheese and I do not feel bad after eating it . I will say I think I would choose this rather then homemade.
--------------------
This is my favorite Lean Cuisine meal. It doesn’t even taste like a “low calorie, healthier” meal. It’s so flavorful and cheesy. It also is a decent sized portion!
--------------------
I used to buy this ALL the time until I couldn’t find it anymore (ironically anything I take a liking to suddenly disappears off the shelves and either never comes back or comes back renewed and terrible). Whoever decided broccoli was a good add on obviously hates everyone but themselves because words can not explain how terrible of a decision that was. Microwaved broccoli is the absolute WORST and it consumes EVERYTHING it is served with including this nice and sweet Mac n cheese! I’m super disappointed that my all time favorite Mac has been ruined by the addition of broccoli. If you wanted broccoli just add it yourself! I don’t recommend people add panko breadcrumbs and bacon bits to replicate Longhorn Mac n cheese—I add it myself! The best thing is when it comes plain and you get to add whatever you want to it, I don’t buy TV dinners to take away from it. It already came with just barely enough pasta, now that there broccoli there’s even less pasta and it all tastes like broccoli.
--------------------
This was my favorite product until they added "Now with more cheese". There is so much cheese that I think they left out the noodles. The noodles cant even hold their shape and have broken down. I had to throw away the last two because all I was eating was cheese. Can we please go back to a normal amount of cheese? I wish I could post a photo...
--------------------
Wow first time trying this and was shocked at how good it is! 10/10 buying more next grocery trip.
--------------------
I loved the Matketplace Vermont White Mac & Cheese In the black box. This new version is definitely not the same taste or consistency. Please go back to the Marketplace version.
--------------------
The cheese is more yellow, more calories and lacks flavor
--------------------
why did lean cuisine changed the ingredients in vermont white cheddar cheese Mac & Cheese? The original Marketplace product shows fewer calories and less sodium. The current product is more overall calories and most important, much higher amounts of sodium?
--------------------
The old recipe in the black box was so much better! Tasted better and somewhat better for you. The new recipe doesn't taste nearly as good and now has more calories and over 100+ mg more of sodium (now 800 mg total) as if it needed more. Used to be my favorite but won't be buying anymore :(
--------------------
I eat a couple lean cuisine meals a week and love most of the options. The more cheese added version of the Vermont Mac and cheese makes the meal mushy and is not an improvement in the least.
--------------------
I realize I am in the minority here, but I really prefer the new recipe. I found the old recipe to be bland and soupy, now it is flavorful and gooey like "real" macaroni and cheese. I eat this for dinner about twice a week.
--------------------
This used to be my favorite Lean Cuisine, but the new recipe is gritty and tastes different. It's also more calories than the old recipe. Please just bring back the original!
--------------------
After hoarding all Mac n cheese in the black box, I cannot find anymore. I bought my daughter the “more cheese” version and now my daughter won’t eat it. She said it tasted funny and left a bad after taste. I drove to 5 different stores today but no one has it. I’m bummed! To bad you can’t make both kinds.
--------------------
I've enjoyed the Vermont Mac and Cheese for several years. I was disappointed when I had the 'Now With More Cheese' recipe today. It has noticeably more salt (too much!) and a heavier aftertaste. I prefer the previous recipe
--------------------
We loved the Marketplace Vermknt Mac and cheese in the black box. This stuff is awful. You took a good thing and ruined it. I thought Lean Cuisine was moving in a positive direction with the old ingredients and I was starting to look at your products as a healthy option. But this new recipe
--------------------
Had been buying this product for a few years, tried the new version recently. It is decent and perfectly edible. I will buy in the future.
--------------------
Overall I like most of Lean Cuisines offerings but not this one. Cheese is very gritty
--------------------
I LOVED the original version of this dish, the one in the black box. Like other reviewers here, I've noticed that this version with more calories and supposedly more cheese is runny and not as flavorful. It's still OK, but it used to be so much better.
--------------------
I have a kid who is a very picky eater. I would give him the black box Vermont Mac and Cheese as a meal a couple times a month. My whole family enjoyed it, especially my son. It's quite disappointing that you all had to go and change a good thing. He does not care for the new version with 'more cheese' and it appears some quality of ingredients were lessened. Just another one of life's little disappointments. Bummer.
--------------------
We used to love Marketplace Vermont White Cheddar Mac & Cheese but it is no longer available. The old Mac & Cheese was also pretty good. But this new concoction is awful. It is salty and watery and otherwise tasteless.
--------------------
I haven't had Lean Cuisine in along time. I tried 2 other meals and they were meh. This is one is good! Nice and cheesey. I like to cook it where it gets a little crusty around the edges. Pretty good.
--------------------
Now since more cheese added, seems a bit runny. Still tasty.
--------------------
My family loves the black box, in fact we bought 4-6 a week. I bought 6 boxes of the white box thinking it would be the same, but it is not. It is mush. I have made two boxes now and both have been mushy and almost flavorless. We will not be buying again unless I stumble across the black boxes again. So disappointing.
--------------------
I bought this regularly in the black "Marketplace" box and it did say organic. Now it says new, but it does not say organic on the box Im holding, nor does it mention GMOs. I guess this is cheaper? I wont buy it again. Why does Lean Cuisine keep making good products and then ruin them? This is the 3rd time lately they have done it to a meal I enjoy.
--------------------
Vermont White Cheddar Mac & Cheese used to be our family favorite . . . until the recipe changed. The new/white package says "More Cheese" in it now, but it must not be a very good cheese. It tasted very floury/almost like eating paste. We were not impressed.
--------------------
The new version of this is cheesier but definitly tastes more fake and is very rich which is really upsetting! I am so bummed as this was my favorite but can't say it still is/: if more cheese might need more noodles because that quantity didn't change!
--------------------
Liked old version much better. Is this replacing black box mac & cheese?
--------------------
The former recipe (in the black box) was WAY better than this one. This one has more calories and a grainier texture than the previous which was creamy and delicious. You made a huge mistake with this one.
--------------------
You e changed to recipe to add more cheese and you’ve ruined it. I LOVED The original version. This one not at all. Why did you ruin it?
--------------------
I love this Mac & Cheese meal. The problem is the sodium content. Can you get it to 500mg's or less? Perhaps use another spice in place of the sodium. Other than that, it is a great product. Thank you.
--------------------
This was a perfect meal for dinner! It was creamy and delicious and I always love Mac n cheese. Perfect comfort food. Maybe a little pepper but I’m all for it!
--------------------
I'm not really a Lean Cuisine kind of guy. but somebody I know raved about this and I asked if it seemed like a really good Mac and Cheese that was portion controller or a light Mac and Cheese. His response was that it seemed like a really god recipe that was just portion controlled to get a reasonable calorie count. And I agree. If it hadn't been for the great experience with this variety of LC, I would have stayed away entirely. This Mac & Cheese owes no apologies to any other. Strangely, for adults, I'm pretty sure this would test better than Stouffer's full calorie/fat Mac & Cheese. It's really very good. I add just a shake or two of ground black pepper to mine but it certainly doesn't need it to be tasty.
--------------------
Very Yummy. Needs Pepper. Warm. Good Texture. Good Cheese. After a long shift. Perfect.
--------------------
Like but please have regular oven 350 etc and 40 mins or something havent gotten sick yet but not happy only microwave directions maybe put in different spot in supermarket, tired of buying and taking chances
--------------------
Not bad but If my heart could handle the amount of salt content in these meals I'd eat more. I consider this to be a junk food, nothing healthy about the noodles. The macros in regards to protein is one thing but any nutritionist would consider Other Healthy Alternatives.
--------------------
My all time favorite Lean Cuisine dish! Tastes AMAZING with so little calories!!!!!
--------------------
I have been buying this product for more than a year. I love the flavor - great comfort food. I add a few dashes of Tabasco sauce and it becomes spicy mac and cheese. Unfortunately, the reason I did not provide a 5 star rating is that the last few boxes seem to be much more "saucy" and a diminished amount of pasta. I have been cooking it in the same microwave and have not altered the time. I will not stop purchasing the product, but I would love to understand why the change?
--------------------
I have purchased this many times and I love it! It makes a delicious comfort food for dinner. I throw some steamed broccoli in it and make an awesome meal! I buy 3 at a time!!!
--------------------
Creamy, tasty, satisfies the comfort food craving. All around awesome-ness.
--------------------
Rich delicious tasty are just of few things that come to my mind. This is a stock up favorite!
--------------------
This is my "go to" when I don't want to cook. Mix it with some fresh veggies or a side salad. Best purchased mac & cheese out there.
--------------------
I have been buying this product weekly for years and loved it. The last few I bought and ate were horrible. The new recipe is mostly sauce. I had to search thru the saucy muck to try to find the macaroni. This was gross! I won’t be buying this anymore. In fact, I’ll probably throw out what I have left in the freezer.
--------------------
I really like this Mac and Cheese - it tastes like real cheese and not like powdered cheese-like product. I serve this with a large side of steamed broccoli to make a full meal.
--------------------
The reason I said this maccaroni is the worst is because when I tried it, it tasted real bitter and sour I had to throw it away
--------------------
One of my go to meals. Creamy and delicious. Great comfort food.
--------------------
I've always loved most anything white cheddar, but never found any white cheddar macaroni I liked before, so I was a little hesitant. I'm glad I decided to try it though because I loved it. I could eat it every day
--------------------
This is one of my two favorite Lean Cuisine meals. Sometimes I eat it by itself and sometimes I will add cooked chicken, sausage, or tuna. It's delicious! I wish they also made a gluten-free version so my daughter could have it. Delicious!
--------------------
Just recently purchased..love it made into a casserole with veggies and any type meat. Very WW friendly. Even my particular husband likes it and he is a mac n cheese fanatic.
--------------------
This mac and cheese is delicious on its own. But I also enjoy it when mixed with either albacore tuna, or chicken, as an irresistible casserole.
--------------------
I have bought this for quite a while now. The recipe is now 2/3 sauce and 1/3 macaroni. The name needs to be changed to macaroni soup!
--------------------
The primary flavor is salt. The pasta is gummy and rubbery. The sauce is runny and tasteless with no hint of cheese flavor. Completely awful
--------------------
This mac and cheese tastes just like I used to make when I lived in PA and could get that amazing super sharp cheddar. Creamy and satisfying!
--------------------
This is one of my all time favorite Lean Cuisine meals. In my opinion, it tastes a lot like Panera Bread's macaroni and cheese!
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite Lean Cuisine! I buy it on a weekly basis. The cheese is creamy and smooth. Makes a great lunch or dinner! Please don't ever discontinue this product.
--------------------
I used to love this Mac and Cheese but agree with another reviewer... it doesn't taste good anymore. The sauce is less cheddary and has a gross slimy texture. Maybe from too much rice starch? Won't buy again-- why can't you people leave these recipes alone?? You ruined Glazed Chicken which was your best product for decades.
--------------------
This is a good choice if you are craving the smooshiness of mac and cheese, but don't want the guilt or fat of the "real thing." Since I know myself pretty well and know that if I ate it by itself, I'd want two....I mixed it with a cup of fresh steamed peas to stretch it further. Not bad! If you wanted to, you could even add some tuna to make a sort of little casserole. Would I buy it again? Maybe. Though I would say that I do prefer the Italian and Indian offerings better from LC. For those who complain about lack of flavor....it's M&C, guys, not garlic chicken spring rolls.....mmm.....LC spring rolls.... Sorry, I got distracted! Over all, nice choice.
--------------------
Doesn’t even feel like “diet” food. Amazing flavor and texture. Filling, too. You will not be disappointed!
--------------------
The Vermont White Cheddar Mac & Cheese is delicious. It's so good you don't even reealize there is no meat in your dinner.
--------------------
I love this one so much! I like to steam some broccoli and add it to this... AMAZING! I could eat it everyday I’m not even kidding. I don’t get bored when it comes to food I can eat it over and over again! Must try!
--------------------
I used to love this product,best Mac and cheese ever. It isn't the same as it used to be.It is now very mushy and it has a lot more sauce than before,and it's not as cheddary as before.What did they do to my Mac and cheese?
--------------------
I love this dish. The noodles are always perfect, the sauce is cheese tasting without the strong yellow cheddar flavor. This product beats competitors with this type of entree.
--------------------
There is no way that this taste like a healthy Mac & cheese. Great flavor and the pasta holds that cheesy sauce so well. My favorite entre of all!!
--------------------
This is by far my fav lean cuisine. I add a pinch of salt & pepper flakes for a little pizzazz! Its perfect for lunch. Thanks Lean Cuisine!
--------------------
I have this for lunch, very good and filling. I love white cheddar and this is very tasty.
--------------------
Really, Really Good! I am trying to watch my portion control with food. I had this alone with an apple for lunch and I am pleasantly satisfied. Flavor is there and the next time I buy this I will add some steamed vegetables to go with it! Delicious!
--------------------
When I received this sample I was excited about trying it. I really like most white cheddar mac and cheese, but this one had a horrible taste. The texture was awful and it tastes like it was expired. Maybe it was just the box I received. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
We both love this one and try to keep it in the freezer at all times.
--------------------
I love mac and cheese but it's tough to make it for one, so I buy the frozen variety. Lately my usual choices have not been available, so I decided to try this - a big mistake. It was astronishingly bland and essesntially flavorless, which was an unpleasant surprise. A most unsatisfactory lunch.
--------------------
I'm so happy I bought this a month ago I love the taste and so does my family.
--------------------
I've been buying this product for over a year and the calories were 250 (the fat/sodium/etc also lower). The boxes recently changed the last two months to indicate 260 calories (more fat/sodium/etc). The ingredients appear to be the same, but I do not know this 100% since I only have the 260 calorie box to view.
--------------------
Love this macaroni and cheese but please use a whole grain or whole wheat pasta to up the fiber.
--------------------
I eat this whenever I want a rich, guilty (but not really) pleasure. Love the pasta shape --thicker than pasta in other LC mac n cheese and the cheese sauce is much tastier
--------------------
I will by this occasionally looks delicious and healthy
--------------------
I was excited to try this because it looked very tasty. It tasted very good but it didn't fill me up at all and the texture was very weird. It was all clumpy and reminded me of cottage cheese. Overall, the taste is good, but the texture is just weird.
--------------------
Bought this wanted to change up my lunch, tasted great but my only issue was the pasta got a little bit mushy. Also I think it needs some more sauce. Thanks
--------------------
I have this for lunch at least twice a week! Tastes amazing and rich!
--------------------
I'm eating this right now and it's wonderful. The perfect comfort food or carbohydrate craving fix to go with a salad or veggies.
--------------------
my kids go crazy for mac and cheese and it is always on my shopping list I recently got a chance to taste this Lean Cuisine - Vermont White Cheddar Mac & Cheese I’m usually not a huge fan of frozen meals specially macaroni and cheese coz I never ate it but weekday dinner problem is solved and once in a while kids get to eat what they love the taste was nice and the macaroni was super soft perfect to my kids taste [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is very tasty, it's one of my "go-to" for work lunches, I pair it with a sliced apple and it's perfect portion. The cheese is also a nice smooth texture, which I find some "frozen" options are gritty, this has none of that. Tasty!
--------------------
Tastes like an indulgence but not too guilty of one!
--------------------
This is the best white cheddar mac out there in the freezer section.
--------------------
I have never been huge on the food crazes especially with organic foods. Half of the time I have never tell if a product is really organic or not expect for the labels. Recently I have been trying to get back on track with a healthier lifestyle. That means healthier eating for me but not depriving myself from the foods I love. Reading up on this pasta I see that it is healthier and does not have any added preservatives like most products. I like that the sauce is not too creamy but is not watered down and the portion size is ideal for my weight loss goal. Overall, it had a creamy white cheddar flavor and was filling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Macaroni and cheese is my favorite food and one that I eat often. Since it's not the healthiest, I wanted to try a low-calorie version. This macaroni and cheese had good flavor! My only complaint is that the noodles were a little soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I was really looking forward to trying the Vermont White Cheddar Mac and Cheese and was less then thrilled by the product. It was not bad, but not great either. It was merely average. It was fast and easy though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have eaten this LC once and it was very yummy. However, the portion was just a little too small and not filling enough. I think this LC would benefit from upping the portion and calories slightly. It's only 250, so another 50 or 80 calories would probably still work for most people.
--------------------
I’m usually not a huge fan of frozen meals, but this one has helped change my mind. The cheese flavor was absolutely amazing. Although it tastes great on it’s own, i added a few pieces of lobster meat & some freshly grated parmesan cheese and it then became doubly amazing :-) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor was good and the pasta was all mushy like typical tv diners. Portion size was good for a quick small meal but if you are hungry you will want to add something on the side. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This Lean Cuisine microwaveable dish is almost as good as home-made! It is absolutely delicious and a great twist on a classic meal. My child loves Macaroni and Cheese so heating one of these on a busy night makes for a great meal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have for to try this along with a couple of the other Lean Cusiune and they are great. For someone who loves food that I normally regret eating this is something that was awesome. My children also have enjoyed eating these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Very good! This is one of the best macaroni and cheese frozen meals that I have had. Great for lunch! Perfect size. Great for a fast meal for children. Firm noodles, tasty cheeses, not soupy like most mac and cheese. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Easy to locate in the freezer section of your local grocery store. Many other main meals and sides available. This Vermont cheddar mac has a spin on the usual mac and cheese. Good sauce flavor and consistency. Pasta is firm. Is best when eating with a side of vegetables or protein to stay full longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is the second Lean Cuisine meal that I've tried and I have not yet been disappointed!! The price for the entire meal is so low compared to the awesome taste that you get in a Lean Cuisine. This has a really intense white cheddar taste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Let me stay by saying I love mac and cheese and this Lean Cuisine Vermont White Cheddar didn't disappoint! When I usually get frozen mac and cheese the cheese sauce cooks too much and is hard to eat but not with this! The taste was delicious! The noodles were a decent size so I could actually eat them with a fork! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The noodles were just beyond aldente and the cheese was creamy. I expected a little more sharpness in the flavor though and it burned when I followed cooking instructions. I suggest reducing the time by maybe 15 to 20 seconds. Overall Vermont White Cheddar Lean Cuisine makes a great lunch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Purchased the Vermont White Cheddar Mac & Cheese as it looked good in the package. I liked the organic pasta and the fact that it wasn't overly cheesy was a nice plus. The white cheddar is a nice change from the heavy original. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This product has the right amount of cheese!! Not too much and not too little. The pasta was perfectly done, following the directions. Not soggy at all. It did require salt and pepper, but then most foods do! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I rushed home to enjoy this. Salisbury has been a long time favorite. The gravy was good. Only 1/2 slice of mushroom. Nothing like the box showed. The Mac &cheese was good. The meat was nasty. Texture was strange. Tender. I didn’t see any time directions on the box for different wattage microwave. I didn’t see any cooking time at all. I like LC bowls, lasagna, but not this. I would recommend LC but not Salisbury steak and Mac.
--------------------
I love the flavor of this meal. Savory without being salty and the mac n cheese is perfect. This actually tastes like a home made patty and that is more than enough to keep me buying this meal over and over.
--------------------
The meat, gravy, and cheese sauce were entirely flavorless. Actually, there was a slight flavor, but I could not identify it. However, there was savoriness, onion flavor, or even a hint of salt. There was not a single mushroom in the gravy, not even small pieces. It was simply inedibly bad. My sense of taste is fine.
--------------------
This Salisbury Steak and Mac & Cheese is absolutely disgusting. Waste of money and it has the worst taste. I had to throw it away. I can't get the taste out of my mouth.
--------------------
I rarely write reviews but I needed to comment on this. The Mac & cheese was okay but the Salisbury steak tasted like dog food.
--------------------
I bought this a couple of weeks ago and it was the worst tasting entrée ever.
--------------------
OMG, I've had this before, many times, but never has it tasted so disgusting to me! It's been maybe 6 months since the last time I had it, and now I'm wondering if there's been a change in the recipe? It's also not in a black container - this one is translucent. Perhaps that came along with the outer packaging change? Not sure, but this is the last time I'll be buying this particular meal. I can't even finish it! I've never had any reason to complain about any of the other Lean Cuisine meals I've had, but this is so bad, I just couldn't keep it to myself. I usually eat these for lunch at work.
--------------------
Didnt care for this meal as much as others as the meat was flavorless
--------------------
I bought the Salisbury Steak with Macaroni & Cheese this week for the first time. It was disgusting which is very rare for Lean Cuisine. The Macaroni & Cheese really didn't much taste but I ate that part of the meal. The Salisbury Steak was horrible. There were no mushrooms. The gravy tasted like it was made from dirty dish water and the meat taste like it had been sitting in dirty dish water. I wouldn't even feed it to dog, if I had one. It's leaving a nasty after taste in my mouth too. This is the first time ever that I have been disappointed enough to right a review.
--------------------
The Salisbury steak itself was great. The meat was good and the gravy had a great taste. I just wish there was a different side than Mac and cheese. Like mashed potatoes. The mac and cheese also had a boring, bland flavor. Otherwise I'd give 5 stars.
--------------------
Not much flavor except for the bitter after taste.  Will not be buying again.
--------------------
I always bought this and prepared it in oven. I now bought three and says microwave only. It doesn’t taste as well as in the oven. Why was it changed? Bring back the other as an alternative.
--------------------
Sorry guys, this was utterly gross! They both tasted like they were drowned in preservatives with a strong bitter after taste I literally threw it in the trash and if I could upload a picture i'd show you. Next!
--------------------
This was one of my favorite and was low on calories but now they increased the calories and both sauces are watery! It's but was way better before.
--------------------
The steak and Mac mix well together. Great flavors
--------------------
I just love this meal and it is a regular part of my weekly diet. It tastes great and really fills you up!
--------------------
One of my favorites so far, mac and cheese is delicious and reminds me of our family baked mac and cheese recipe. Salisbury steak is as close to homemade taste as I have had in frozen meals
--------------------
This was really good, and the calorie count is awesome. If you notice, a lot of the comfort meals are actually lower calories than other Lean Cuisines (and a lot lower than other brands). I'll definitely buy this one again.
--------------------
I tried Salisbury Steak with Macaroni and Cheese for the first time yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. I've never been one that liked any frozen beef meals as they never had a good taste. Not only was the steak very good but the macaroni and cheese was delicious and not overdone at all. I liked them so much I ran to the store and got 12 more and stuck them in the freezer!
--------------------
When you just want some comfort food this will hit the spot. Always a good choice.
--------------------
I had this for dinner last night and it was pretty yummy. The steak was more like a smoked beef patty than Salisbury steak. The macaroni and cheese was great! I might buy it again.
--------------------
My husband couldn't find any of the Glazed Chicken or Turkey Lean Cuisine meals I really like and picked up the Salsbury Steak dinner. I was reluctant to try it and it sat in the freezer for two weeks. I finally tried it tonight and it is my new favorite! I hope our store keeps it stocked, everytime I find one of these I really like I have a hard time finding it again! Wish we could just order direct from Stouffers for home delivery!
--------------------
Salisbury Steak with Macaroni & Cheese is the PERFECT frozen entree for me: tastes fine (I sprinkle with a little hot sauce on both), high protein keeps me full longer yet the calories are lower than some of the other higher protein entrees. Easy to fix: poke holes, M/W, rest a min & eat-no fancy container tricks; no stopping, stirring, etc. I must not be the only fan because it's often sold out at the grocery stores. I buy 14 at a time when I can find that many. It is the cornerstone of my weight reduction program. I just change the side salads to keep dinner from being boring.
--------------------
The salisbury steak is moist and well seasoned. The gravy has a good consistancy - not watery, and it's very flavorful. The thing that falls a little short for me is the mac & cheese. It's okay but just okay. The cheese flavor is lacking, rather barely there. I love cheese so I expect more flavor from this mac & cheese.
--------------------
Better than I expected. At 7 smart points, it's a great WW dinner option.
--------------------
The Mac 'n cheese was tasty. As far as how the meat really tasted...I couldn't tell because I couldn't get past the sodium. I did notice the sodium contact when I bought but guess I didn't think it would be THAT bad!
--------------------
they've changed something. ive been buying lean cuisines for almost 10yrs now, and the meat is much, much spicier than it used to be.
--------------------
Hearty gravy and mushrooms really compliment the Salisbury steak and the macaroni and cheese is the perfect side!
--------------------
This meal is delicious! I eat it at least twice a week. I am weird when it comes to eating frozen meats and this one has never let me down. Great taste, great portion and fantastic side. Can't go wrong with this choice!
--------------------
I first tried this because my children requested it. The flavors of the salisbury steak and mushroom gravy is very comforting. The mac & cheese is a little bland and not as creamy as I would like, but overall, this is a great home-style dish that the whole family enjoys.
--------------------
I really enjoyed the steak. The mac and cheese was not that great but the steak made up for it 100%.
--------------------
I'm trying to eat higher protein meals, and lower carbs. This meal is great because I get a little Mac and cheese, which I typically avoid, and a ton of protein.
--------------------
I bought this meal today. I had weight loss surgery and I look for lots of protein. I don't eat pasta or rice, so I cannot comment on the Mac and cheese. The Salisbury Steak was a good size, and I loved the sauce. I wish I could get the nutrition information for just the Salisbury Steak part of this meal.
--------------------
Just like mom used to make! I really enjoyed this dish.
--------------------
Perfect combination for a delectable cheat meal but the right portion size while having the scrumptious taste. Creamy cheese makes your mouth mesmerized while eating the seasoned meat and gravy....delish!!
--------------------
Have this with a salad and you will be satisfied. The mac and cheese is cheesy!
--------------------
i would highly and i mean highly recommend this dinner!
--------------------
This is one of my favorites the mac and cheese is great the Salisbury steak is great definitely one I purchase over and over again I would be happier if it was going up so much sodium however Lean Cuisine needs to be aware the people who are attempting to have a better lifestyle don't need so much sodium
--------------------
I love this particular entrée and stock up whenever I find it in my local store. I'm not a big fan of red meat but this is about the closest I come to a steak and in fact prfer it more.
--------------------
Still my favorite....I've been branching out the different lean cuisine options, marketplace, paninus,etc...but this is still home to me!
--------------------
I love mac and cheese and love Salisbury steak. Unfortunately, I didn't look at the picture on the box that displayed giant mushrooms in the meal. I don't get why companies always try to spiffy up meals with ingredients that don't belong.
--------------------
I REALLY LIKE THE MEATLOAF & THE POTATOS ARE GREAT.
--------------------
This meal has a tasty sauce over tender beef and creamy pasta.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite Lean Cuisine meals. The Salisbury steak is very tasty but not the least bit greasy. It has a good texture and the meat is tender. It has a very good gravy over the meat. The macaroni and cheese in this dinner is my very favorite mac and cheese anywhere. Lean Cuisine has a cheese sauce on this pasta that is the absolute best! I could probably eat mac and cheese everyday and with this product you really could. Calories are within my nutritional needs. This mac and cheese is not high calorie but it is very creamy. How do they do that? It is just one delicious dinner that you can really enjoy. #Love It!
--------------------
One of my L/C meals that I go to after a long day. Love the cheesy flavor of mac & cheese, doesn't taste artificial. The Salisbury steak is tender & yummy with tasty gravy. Sometimes I add broccoli to mac & cheese bringing two of my favorite flavors together while adding fiber.
--------------------
This meal is the perfect "comfort" food and you get the perfect heathy portion size.
--------------------
This is a very hearty meal, so I enjoy it at dinner time. The meat cooks perfectly, and I like to stir the gravy into my mac and cheese. This is a delicious meal!
--------------------
I looked forward to some old fashioned comfort food. The salisbury steak was great. It was moist and flavorful. The mac and cheese was good but a bit dry which is why I put it at 4 stars/
--------------------
This is comfort food at its best. The steak is tender and the mushroom gravy is delicious, as is the macaroni and cheese.
--------------------
Love this one. The salisbury is good and the gravy is a favorite. But I reallyb love the macaroni and cheese - nice and creamy and tasty.
--------------------
I just tried this meal, and I'm so happy I did! Definitely meets the need to fix a comfort food craving without adding to your waistline.
--------------------
I bought this for the first time. I loved it and so did my child, who is a very picky eater.
--------------------
Tasty and easy to eat. One of my favorites It has just the right amount of gray.
--------------------
I wanted mac n cheese and I love salisbury steak. It did not disappoint me. It was very good.
--------------------
I really enjoyed this meal. I love the fact that it isn't a comfort meal that blows the entire days allotment of calories! I had this meal along with a fresh pear and I was full for hours.
--------------------
I stocked up on some Lean Cuisines when I heard we were getting several days of snow and ice. The 2 kids and I tried the Salisbury Steak after playing in the snow and it was a BIG hit. Great flavor -- the combination with the Mac and Cheese was perfect -- and we had full tummies for our long nap, Thanks, LC!
--------------------
The meat is average -- I'm picky about what my Salisbury steak should taste like -- but the gravy was seasoned well. It may have been the texture of the meat though that threw me off. The mac and cheese wasn't bad but it was pretty bland. Looked like mac and cheese without the wonderful creamy cheese flavor/feeling that mac n cheese should have.
--------------------
If you are in the mood for some comfort food, this is offers two good ones. The sauce for the salisbury steak adds good flavor that you can dip into. Who doesn't like mac and cheese, so this is a double good one.
--------------------
I do not purchase this mean too frequently, since I prefer meals that have some vegetables. However, sometimes you just need some comfort food, and the Salisbury Steak and Mac and Cheese delivers. This meal is tasty, and not too salty. The only downside is that it doesn't leave me feeling as full as some of the other lean cuisine meals, and I was craving a snack by mid-day after having this meal for lunch.
--------------------
I'm not a huge fan of any kind of beef tv dinner, because the meat is always a little suspect. So I admit to being skeptical when purchasing, but I was willing to give it a chance. I may just be overly picky, but I could not stomach this meat. The texture was mush, the taste was weird, and I had to give it to the dogs. The mac n cheese was good though, and the sauce around the meat was flavorful. It's not a bad meal, but it's not my cup of tea.
--------------------
All the flavors are there but the mac is pretty bland. The steak looks like a meat puck but the mushroom gravy keeps it very tender and moist. Eat fast though- the longer it sits the colors start to change into a very unappetizing plastic version of their original selves and the at first delicious gravy is more reminiscent of condensed soup... or brown salt gel. Brown salt gel aside this is one of my go-to meals from Lean Cuisine.A perfect staple when you need some comfort food without ruining your day.
--------------------
Taste yummy, is filling, and healthy! Thanks Lean Cuisine. The diet plan is working!!!
--------------------
Its missing the flavor, the steak is decent but the mac is whack.
--------------------
This is comfort food. The steak is seasoned just right and there's plenty of gravy. The mac and cheese is also good - but not terrific. It is a little pasty, but when dipped in the gravy, tastes much better.
--------------------
This is an item that I will continue to purchase comfort food is a perfect description!!!
--------------------
Macaroni and cheese and Salisbury steak its the best.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite dinner meals. The meat is pretty impressive and I have always loved mac and cheese. This isn't the best mac and cheese I have had, but for a frozen meal, there is absolutely nothing wrong about the quality of it.
--------------------
pretty good taste for frozen food; it's a quick and easy meal for quick dinner. Also, healthy food is a huge plus; great for students.
--------------------
This is really good for a low calorie meal! It is a great size steak patty and nice cheesy Mac and Cheese. Mushroom gravy keeps thing moist, and really has a home-style taste to the complete meal... it is very satisfying.
--------------------
I'm a stay at home mom. Most days I'm running around after my boys and when I finally get 2 minutes to breath the last thing I want to do is stand in the kitchen and cook a meal for myself. I decided to try a couple of the LC meals. I didn't have high expectations because most of the time frozen dinners leave you unsatisfied. This meal however was AMAZING! The meat texture was so good and the gravy with the mushroom was extremely rich! I have a few other LC dinners in my freezer and I can't wait to try them!!!!!
--------------------
My husband asks that I buy this one every time I shop
--------------------
I eat this almost 7 nights a week! Sometimes I can't find it in the grocery store. Love the comfort of Salisbury steak and Mac and cheese pre measured
--------------------
I just started buying LC higher protein meals. This is the best! Savory, brown gravy with mushrooms and onions, good texture on the meat. The mac and cheese are rich and have a home made taste. Yes, 9 grams of fat and 310 cal, but it kept me full for hours afterwards.
--------------------
I tried the for dinner , I was surprised it was really good , I could eat this a lot , I will be trying more of the meals
--------------------
I was skeptical when I purchased this meal, I'm picky about my meat texture and salisbury steak can be suspect anyway, but I was happily surprised. The flavors are good and the texture was pretty much the best salisbury steak I think I've ever had from a frozen meal. I also am very pleased with the marco balance of this meal. Lots of LCs are yummy but very carb heavy for a low calorie meal. Even with the mac and cheese this one is still clocks in at reasonable carbs. This meal is a no-brainer when I'm purchasing LCs.
--------------------
Good flavor, mac and cheese solid. One of my favorites, best of all <400 calories.
--------------------
it was ok nice change from chicken once in a while
--------------------
The onions and mushrooms were a nice touch, but the Salisbury steak itself had little to no flavor. Good consistency, especially for frozen meat, but just not that great. The mac and cheese was probably the only saving grace.
--------------------
It's a pretty mild flavor (not in a bad way) and I like amount of vegetables you get with this meal.
--------------------
I have been buying this product for years and some of the changes were minor enough to ignore for how much I enjoyed the meal. However the changes in quality and taste are now all together no longer able to ignore. The sauce flavor and consistency has decreased, the amount of ravioli in the dish has decreased, and the quality of the ravioli has gone down. I will now only purchase if they are on a deeeeeeep discount as it is otherwise no longer worth it.
--------------------
Originally, this included a thick creamy sauce and walnuts. The walnuts provided the rigth balance to the squash and veggies. A few years ago, the walnuts disappeared. In the last few months, the sauce has turned so liquidy it is almost water and no matter how well you follow the directions or adjust the time, it spills out everywhere. This has always been a favorite, please bring back the creamy sauce! The walnuts would be loved, too!
--------------------
I love the sauce and veggies. Thank God I do, because there were only 3 raviolis in my last serving. When they say "Lean" they really, really mean it. I may stop buying Lean Cuisine. My friends have noticed skimpiness as well lately.
--------------------
I always look for this one since it sells quickly. Usually I add my own veggies to Lean Cuisine, but Butternut Ravioli doesn’t need extra.
--------------------
not much flavor,could not taste the squash,vegetables took over the whole dish and sauce was very bland
--------------------
This is by far the best of all the meals. Many veggies and raviolis in a light white sauce. Great for lunch. I try to keep a couple on hand at all times in case I don’t feel like cooking, just pop into the microwave and you’ll have something good.
--------------------
My go to meal almost every evening and thankfully doesn't upset my lactose intolerance!
--------------------
My Hubby bought me the Butternut Squash, as he knows I try to eat healthy. I am impressed. Not only smells good, but has a very nice taste. Lean Cuisine is a life saver. I love their dishes. The only thing I would change is to add more fiber.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite Lean Cuisines it's really good!
--------------------
This is one of LC's best... A large portion of veggies in a great sauce. The butternut ravs are quite delicious! Wonderful vegetarian option!
--------------------
Tried this for the first time about a week ago. I love it! Purchased it again today for the 3rd time.
--------------------
This is one of my regular choices and is usually really good but today I only got 3 raviolis and a ton of vegetables. Usually get at least 5 ravioli. Disappointed and will surely be hungry soon!
--------------------
Great flavor in a healthy entree! Love the thin-cut veggies mixed with the ravioli.
--------------------
I bought this tonight for myself since my husband was gone and was so looking forward to it but I opened it and it was ALL vegetables with 1 ravioli. This is not the dinner I bought and expected and definitely will not fill me up for dinner. Very disappointed I spent money on this
--------------------
I've only recently become a meatless consumer, and I was floored by how much I enjoyed this butternut squash ravioli. Today was my second time buying it and it's so delicious. The veggies are a little on the hard side, but not a big deal! Can't wait to try LC's other meatless options!
--------------------
Been eating BSR for years. Good balance. Recently there has been 3x the number of pieces of red pepper than before. I used to spend 2 minutes picking out the red pepper pieces between the two microwave phases. Now it's around 5 minutes. At some point I will give up on BSR. The extra-pepper boxes have end labels 9261587813 T 17:58 Oct2020. I hope it is a temporary glitch
--------------------
I’ve been buying the butternut squash ravioli for years. It’s always been such a great meal, well balanced and delicious. The new recipe with “1 cup of vegetables” is disappointing. The vegetables overwhelm the dish and it is no longer the balanced light delicious meal it used to be.
--------------------
I have been purchasing the butternut squash ravioli for many years and it is my favorite lean cuisine out of all of them (: 5 stars from me! The raviolis are delicious and the vegetables taste crisp and fresh. Perfect for a good, low calorie lunch or dinner.
--------------------
The vegetables taste fresh and the ravioli is so unbelievably delicious. I’m glad I purchased this one and will be sure to look for it next time I go grocery shopping. Seriously, the ravioli is phenomenal!
--------------------
Love this one! Great tasting and has one cup of vegetable.
--------------------
Wish they had more healthy choices with vegetables and no meat.
--------------------
My default entree for a vegetarian lunch. I am a carnivore but adore this entree at lunch for a change of pace. Perfection to enjoy pasta in a creamy sauce for a mere 260 calories. This entree makes me forget ai am dieting! Thank you, LC!
--------------------
One of the best meals LC has to offer. It is as delicious a meal that you can have for a frozen meal. It's also filling.
--------------------
Surprised to try this today and find no ravioli, not one. All vegetables. What happened to quality control?
--------------------
These are awesome!!! Love the amount of veggies and the flavor is just so good. I buy these every time i go to the grocery store.
--------------------
Wife purchased this and other L.C. meal WHICH I DIDN'T WANT, but she bought them nonetheless and to my surprise and delight they were really delicious and almost totally filling. Because I need to shed a Bunch of pounds a great toasty and filling meal will help me in the process. Thanks L.C.
--------------------
The flavor of squash embraced by this ravioli is incredibly delicious. The additional vegetables are further engaged with the sauce. This is my favorite go to food on this planet. Thank you Lean Cuisine.
--------------------
Most non meat entrees are bland but this one was so amazing and well seasoned.
--------------------
This is one of my favorites. I take these to work for lunch and tried this one. VERY good.
--------------------
These raviolis are delicious! I'm not really a veggie fan, but this is really good.
--------------------
I enjoyed the flavor & sauce. Having beans that still have some crunch (not mushy) was a good surpirse.
--------------------
I have to start off by saying I am a seriously picky eater. In general, it is extremely hard to find premade meals that I enjoy in general and within the Lean Cuisine brand. It has been a few years since I have eaten premaid meal but I saw this dish and decided to give it a try. I WAS ASTOUNDED!!! I enjoyed it so much that I have it at least once a week. I loved it so much that I have started trying some other dishes as well.
--------------------
This is one of my most favorite LC meals. The flavor is amazing, even though I miss the walnuts that used to be in it. The only reason I won't give it five stars is because of the awful strings on the green beans. The green beans are fresh and crisp, but for the love of Pete, please de-string them, or replace them with another vegetable if it's too costly to do so!
--------------------
I love this meal. It is satisfying, health conscious, and most importantly, MEAT FREE! But I find it so hard to eat with the snap peas not being stringless. I constantly have to pick out the difficult to chew "strings". This could easily be made with a "stringless" variety!
--------------------
I purchased several varieties of Lean Cuisine ravioli entrees to compare and this was by far my FAVORITE. It totally exceeded my expectations! The veggies were crisp and tasted fresh, while the ravioli had great texture and flavor. It also left me completely full unlike other"top rated" Lean Cuisine vegetarian meals. This one's definitely a keeper!
--------------------
I love squash and was so excited to see this dinner come out. It's hard to find but when I do find it, I purchase all I can.
--------------------
I haven’t eaten a frozen meal in many years. I have been counting calories and trying to loose weight for a year now. I have lost over 55 pounds! For a female...that is a big deal ;) So about 6 weeks ago, I wanted to find other options that were low calorie and shopped down the frozen dinner isle at the grocery store. I bought this butternut squash stuffed ravioli. I was skeptical as I am not a big ravioli fan, but I love squash. To my surprise, this dish was amazing. It didn’t need any added seasoning, it wasn’t bland. Very flavorful. I have since then bought 1-2 Lean Cuisine meals weekly but the butternut squash is always on my list and is the first one I grab as it is my favorite. Easy and quick to prepare, and fills me up. One last thing...I love snow peas too, and there aren’t just 2 snow peas in there, it is filled with them, along with other yummy vegetables. Thanks Lean Cuisine...you have a happy consumer.
--------------------
I look forward to this every time, the taste is good!
--------------------
Ugh I love love love love this meal I can’t! I wanna eat it every day! The veggies are crunchy and the sauce is sooo flavorful! The ravioli is amazing. Seriously, must try!
--------------------
I just tried the Butternut Squash Ravioli... I love it!!!
--------------------
The product has gone downhill. There were no snap peas but now some cut green beans and spinach. This was a very nice dish, but I will think twice about buying it again without the snap peas.
--------------------
I'm vegetarian and it's hard to find quality frozen meals. I was surprised at how great this meal tasted. The ravioli had great flavour and was tender. The vegetables were crisp and the sauce coated everything nicely. I've tried other frozen stuffed pastas and they don't turn out well at all, usually tough and dry. These were perfect! Tasted freshly made not frozen. I'll be buying more. Only complaint I have is living in Canada there are many other Marketplace meals I'd like to try but aren't available in Canada.
--------------------
Just tried the butternut squash ravioli, I must say my favorite so far! Really great flavorful raviolis. Definitely recommend this one!
--------------------
My husband and I both just love this meal. It's loaded with great vegetables and the ravioli is filled with sweet butternut squash. Only problem is I can't find it half of the time!
--------------------
Flavor is great, it's delicious with lots of veggies, but literally 4 pieces of ravioli (the box even pictures five pieces for what that's worth lol)... Not very filling. The sauce was very watery. I do like it but not sure about purchasing again, cause I'm still hungry after eating it.
--------------------
I've tried a variety of these boxed meals and it seems like I'm always disappointed. Either it lacks flavor or it is not enough to satisfy my hunger. Finally, I tried the Butternut Squash Ravioli. Not only is the sauce light and delicious, but the vegetables actually taste fresh. The ravioli are full o flavor as well. As a busy teacher, this is my new go-to meal for dinner.
--------------------
Just tried the LC Butternut Squash Ravioli for the first time tonight. I'm glad I did. It was amazing! This version did not have the walnuts in it (or I probably would not have purchased it). Anyway, everything cooked perfectly and the flavors blended well together. Loved the sweetness of the butternut squash in this dish. The sauce was slightly soupy, but not bad. Will definitely be including this in the rotation!
--------------------
Have purchased this in the past and it was very good. The last two, however. Had no film covering the food. Directions say to "cut film to vent".
--------------------
This butternut squash Ravioli is amazing . I feel like i am a celeb at an LA resturant eating this . Tender pasta filled with warm comforting squash , crisp and fresh vegtables in a light yet delicious sauce . If they ever discontinue this one i will die . If i ever were on death row this would be my last meal request lol . Seriously this is that good.
--------------------
I can't believe how decadent and creamy this dish is for being so low in calories and fat. I feel like I'm being naughty when I eat this it is that good! The pasta texture is perfect, especially for being frozen, you would never be able to tel. If I got this at a fancy restaurant I'd be none the wiser. It's amazing!
--------------------
The butternut squash ravioli and vegetables was good with nice portions but the thin almost watery unflavorable sauce killed the whole dish for me.
--------------------
I love this Lean Cuisine meal best! Out of all of the meals, this one is to die for. It’s sweet, savory, and super delicious. The butternut squash adds so much delicious flavor to the meal.
--------------------
Love this meatless option and all the veggies in it. A quick lunch for days when I’m working long hours.
--------------------
It terrifies me to think that, one box after the next, each forkful is as enjoyable as the last. Psychologists and economists need to mark this down as an exception to the Law of Diminishing Returns. A dangerously yummy exception.
--------------------
I have always loved the butternut squash ravioli but I am noticing that the sauce is noticeably thinner than it used to be. Nit sure if you have changed the recipe a little but would give 5 stars if the sauce was thicker again.
--------------------
I am not one that particularly enjoys frozen dinners, but I saw the new packaging and read that it had no artificial color, flavors, or preservatives and decided to give it a try. I AM GLAD I DID... this was absolutely delicious!!!! It tasted like I had ordered to-go from a nice restaurant. The veggies tasted super fresh! I'll be having this dish on a regular basis.
--------------------
Starting down the vegetarian trail I’ve been looking for meatless entrees. I was so pleased to see so many new options from Lean Cuisine! I don’t have to look any further. The Butternut Squash Ravioli is by far my favorite! They are all great, but this one is just right!
--------------------
Have had this so many times over the years and it's still one of my favs, BUT they stopped putting walnuts in it! Butternut squash ravioli without walnuts is not as good!
--------------------
One of my all time favorite dishes from Lean Cuisine. Love the amount of vegetables ratio to ravioli. Tastes delicious. Some might want to add a little seasoning, but I like the sweetness of the butternut squash. Great job Lean Cuisine.
--------------------
The dinner tastes really great, but sometimes there is only four raviolis other times five, and when I'm really lucky six. Six would be the perfect amount of raviolis.
--------------------
Absolutely one of the most mouth-watering dishes I have ever found!
--------------------
I am a vegetarian and have been purchasing Butternut Squash Ravioli for quite a while. Like some other reviewers, I noticed a change in the recipe (not for the better) but still enjoy this product. I add a bit of pepper and my own pecans or walnuts, and it is almost like before. I really like the colorful array and amount of vegetables in this meal and had not noticed a reduction in the number of ravioli. The current amount is fine, since I really love the veggies!
--------------------
I love that this is full of vegetables. The vegetables are crisp and fresh tasting. The ravioli is tasty and al dente.
--------------------
when i was sick i ate one of these a day. so so tasty
--------------------
We have bought this dinner several times in order to get the butternut squash. I would like Lean Cuisine to make a different dish, lower in carbs, with the butternut squash, so I didn't have to peel off the Ravioli pasta. We are senior citizens and need all the vegetables we can get and I find good frozen is better than fresh. This is an excellent idea, but too high in carbs for over 70 and diabetics.
--------------------
Much too high in carbohydrates which become sugars for diabetics .
--------------------
The ravioli and snow peas are the only edible parts of this dish. Creamy sauce is tasteless. Horrible entree.
--------------------
Historically I have loved this meal, but the last two times I have eaten it I have found at least one ravioli with no filling in it. I’m disappointed by the quality lately.
--------------------
This is by far my favorite lean cuisine meal. Very tasty!
--------------------
If you like butternut squash, you'll love this creamy sweet ravioli. The vegetables mixed in with the creamy sauce add extra flavor and crunch.
--------------------
I'm slowly eating my eating my way through all the top ranked LC entrees. So far, I agree with them all. I would give this one a 4 1/2 out of 5.The raviolis taste great. Slightly sweet, which balances well with the veggies. The sauce it nice and creamy. I cut the raviolis in half, so I feel like i'm eating more haha. I would buy this again!
--------------------
I just bought this a few days ago. I am very impressed with the freshness of the vegetables. Great color and crunch. The sauce is light. The ravioli filling is a nice sweet contrast to the sauce. I will definitely be buying this entree again, as well as more lean quinine meals!
--------------------
I used to buy this one ALL the time - it was one of my favorites and hard to find. I don't like the new sauce and it isn't the same without the walnuts. Also think that the additional sugar snap peas are too much, used to have more carrots. Very surprised to see that the amount of sugar is 10g and the protein is only 9g - would be great to see the sugar reduced by half. Who wants almost 3 teaspoons of sugar in their lunch?
--------------------
Great variety of vegetables, creamy sauce, and yummy pillows of butternut squash ravioli goodness!
--------------------
This has such unique flavors that really work together. Love all the veggies in it. One of my favorites.
--------------------
This is my favorite lean cuisine menu item. Lots of bright colorful vegetables that taste fresh! Tasty entrée that I eat over and over again!
--------------------
My wife was having her post op checkup after her open heart surgery. We were staying at hotel by hospital and the hotel had a small "market" I'm a vegetarian and was hungry and I'm very picky. I'm retired Chef of 27 years. This was delicious!! Was worth the $9 charge
--------------------
This is my first time trying these and I am such a finicky eater most of the time but this is delicious!! If the rest of these taste like this I’m very impressed!
--------------------
Butternut Squash Ravioli is one of my all time favorite frozen meals. I'm on a calorie-restricted diet and LC really helps me stay within my target. I know I can rely on LC to provide me with a good-tasting meal. I was really upset a few years ago when the number of raviolis was reduced. Now the recipe has being tinkered with again--the sauce is different and the walnuts are no more. I really don't know if I want to keep purchasing Lean Cuisines if the recipes are going to be changed so often, and usually not for the better.
--------------------
I was super excited to try this as butternut squash is one of my favorite flavors, and typically I really enjoy Lean Cuisine. But this was the most disappointing one I've tried. The raviolis were not filled completely, and the sauce was pretty much flavorless. Super bummer, I hope they can do some quality control in the near future.
--------------------
This is one of my go-to favs too!!!! Love knowing that I am getting so much in the way of vegetables!!
--------------------
Trying to find healthier quick alternative lunch options, i came across these at the grocery store, though the picture looked good so i decided to give them a try. I was extremely surprised how yummy this tasted. It is now one of my favorites! Perfect portion, makes for an easy, quick and healthy lunch or dinner option when i don't have the time or energy to cook. I now buy a couple boxes for lunch for the week whenever I go grocery shopping.
--------------------
I was looking for something to warm up quick because sometimes it's hard to cook when you have a 2 year old that always wants to help. This recipe sounded different so I decided to try it, now my 2 year old daughter loves it so much that I think she eats more of it then I do, which I don't mind since it's something that's healthy for her especially with all the veggies.
--------------------
I am not a vegetarian but I love this dish I would highly recommend it !
--------------------
This is one of my favorite lean cuisines. Love the sweet butternut of the ravioli filling and enjoy the snap peas that come in the dish.
--------------------
I used to purchase this very frequently and then stopped for a while. Today I just had it again. Immediately I noticed a difference before I even ate it. The sauce was thinner but didn't think too much of it. Then I ate it. The flavor of the sauce is no where near as good, the raviolis weren't bad but were lacking something, the walnuts were gone (one of the best parts) and way too may snap peas. This was my go to Lean Cuisine, now I don't know if I will purchase it again.
--------------------
Lean Cuisine offers the best butternut squash ravioli. It is always my "go to" frozen lunch.
--------------------
This honestly is the best frozen meal I have ever had. I am very impressed. Lots of vegetables, which is great (although I could go for more ravioli since it's so delicious).
--------------------
This was sooooo good before, but they changed the recipe and it's not the same. The filling in the ravioli tastes stale or something and is less flavorful, and they removed the walnuts, which were one of the best things about the dish! So mad. I won't be buying this EVER again.
--------------------
This has been my first Lean Cuisine meal in ages and it was so incredibly good! The butternut squash filling is amazing and there's a really good amount of veggies in it. If you want to try these, try this one first!
--------------------
For a meatless dish, this is quite good. I like how there are a variety of vegetables and the sauce is pretty tasty. The raviolis taste pretty nice, too. I like the slightly sweet taste of butternut squash in these raviolis. Like another reviewer said, however, there is a slight garlic taste in the raviolis and I think it would have been better without the garlic taste(though it didn't bother me too much). Otherwise, this is a really good meatless meal and I recommend giving this one a shot.
--------------------
I absolutely love this recipe. The veggies are always fresh tasting and the sauce is to die for. But the ravioli is out of this world. I eat this recipe at least 3 times a week, if not more.
--------------------
just tried it loved it! I like that their are veggies added would love to see reduced sodium products
--------------------
Absolutely tasty and delicious. I recommended this to a vegetarian who now enjoys it regularly.
--------------------
This used to be my favorite but after a break from Lean Cuisines I bought it again after a few months and it is now so garlicky!!!! I don't know why people think Italian and think loads of garlic!!! It does have lots of nice crispy vegetables.
--------------------
Tried this for the first time - it's excellent. Satisfying for lunch put not too heavy on the stomach.
--------------------
The last two of these I have eaten have overflowed in the microwave, the sauce seems much thinner and there are no longer walnuts. Anyone else notice this?
--------------------
I eat this dish all of the time! it contains lot's of fiber, vitamins, and is very filling. It makes getting my daily vegetable portion enjoyable and I always look forward to it.
--------------------
I absolutely loved this one. I always have a hard time finding ravioli without cheese in it( I don't care for cheese) and was pleasantly surprised when I saw this. The sauce is creamy without being thick and dairy tasting which is amazing. The ravioli was sweet without being too sweet. There were TONS of veggies. I will definitely be buying this one over and over.
--------------------
My husband bought this and it was very disappointing. I'm not very picky, but this had no flavor to it. The rice wasn't even good. I don't think adding seasoning would have helped. I would not purchase this again.
--------------------
It was awful. I could not eat it. If zero stars was an option, I would have given it zero.
--------------------
sorry this is one I did not enjoy,it was very bland,not enough sauce and chicken was tough little squares!Needed more soy sauce and rice fried !
--------------------
First time trying it. I didn't like the green beans in it and found it kinda bland. It needs more flavoring and different vegetables.
--------------------
I can no longer find this in any of our local markets. Have you discontinued it? Being Gluten Intolerant this has become my go to quick dinner. Love it. I hope this isn’t a permanent removal
--------------------
I like LC’s asian entrees. Sesame chicken, orange chicken, dumplings. I’m still upset they got rid of the egg roll. So I thought this one would be great! No. The rice is mushy, the flavor is way too garlicky and just not pleasant and the overall texture of the chicken is not enjoyable. Definitely do not recommend.
--------------------
I bought ten packages of the lean cuisine meals. Five of them were teriyaki and rice the other five we're chicken Alfredo. I was however displeased with the teriyaki one because even though I followed the instructions, the rice would not soften. It was like eating undercooked rice. Not pleasant at all.
--------------------
Absolutely delicious. I could eat this every day!
--------------------
I used to eat the Chicken Fried Rice 4-5 days a week. The chicken was never too good, just threw chicken out, but the sauce, rice and veg. were great. They must have changed the recipe because now there is no taste at all. The sauce color is even a light brown now, smells bad now too! Please go back old recipe.
--------------------
I had bought this thinking that it has going to be really good, but I thought again. As I took it out of the microwave it was really, really watery. It was gross. The taste wasn‘t too great either. Like other comments it was very bland it don’t really taste like anything. The texture I tasted was liquid and it was very gross. At least my dog liked it for dinner.
--------------------
I could not eat this.Found it be be very watery,bland and a strong unpleasant flavor. Threw it away.
--------------------
I wanted to try these tasty looking Lean Cuisine entrees. Have used LC for years...usually bought them at big box stores in units of four. This is the first entree that has disappointed me. I used the microwave as my method of cooking. Cooked the entree for 3 minutes, as suggested on the box. Stirred the ingredients....cooked again for 1 1/2 minutes, and let it sit for a little over one minute. It was watery, looked more like a soup than rice dish...and no flavor. Extremely disappointed...and still hungry!
--------------------
I was at the store around lunchtime, hungry for some quick Chinese that wouldn't be too unhealthy, and this looked good. WOW, was I disappointed. This was really flavorless and somewhat watery. Also, while this is very high in protein and relatively low in fat, the sodium content is quite high! If I'm going to consume 720 mg of sodium, the food should be flavorful!
--------------------
I love this meal and have been eating it for more than a year! The only thing is I wish it didn’t have so many sugar grams. Although it is lower than a lot of them. I will continue to eat this meal as long as my palate enjoys it!
--------------------
I started to eat tired of the pasta meals so i ventured out to try a new meal.I don't eat much Chinese food but this tasted pretty good to me or i was just extremely hungry... either way I would definitely purchase this meal again.
--------------------
I love the concept of this product and I love even more that there are gluten free options! However I opened my chicken fried rice to discover that there was no chicken! Very disappointing!
--------------------
I WISH I CAN RETURN WHAT I BOUGHT THIS TASTE DISCUSTING YOU PEOPLE CLEARLY DONT KNOW HOW TO MAKE AN ASIAN FOOD SO STOP. I’M SO disappointed ! I wish I can leave a 0 star instead of 1!
--------------------
I'm gluten free and I like this one. I serve it over a bed of ready rice and it is very filling that way.
--------------------
Just tried this and really liked it. Needs a little low salt soy sauce. So filling though, chicken, peas and carrots were great.
--------------------
I just ate this today and I had to throw it away after three bites. Dang this tastes so nasty. The whole dish was so salty and overwelmed with this sauce that tastes like dog food. The chicken is so rubbery and you have to chew on it a bit to realize that it may be in fact, chicken. I would not recommend this dish..
--------------------
I used to love the Lean Cuisine Chicken Fried Rice meal. It was one of the best Asian meals they made. I would eat it probably 2-3 times per week for lunch. A few years ago they changed the recipe and it is really bad now. Almost no taste to it. Very bland. It's strange because to look at it, you would think that it would be good. It has everything in it that you would find in a normal chicken fried rice meal. Unfortunately, the taste does not match the look. At all. I cannot recommend this meal to anyone anymore. It's a shame.
--------------------
I bought this entree because I remember liking it in the past, but after heating it up, the sauce has a watery consistency and the chicken pieces were so tough I couldn't even chew them. Needless to say, this went in the trash and I had to find something else to eat. I hope some new arrivals happen in 2019, because I still have faith in LC.
--------------------
I bought this today for lunch, and I will NEVER buy again. Flavor was awful, bland. Put a bad taste in my mouth, I couldn’t even eat it the rest after two bites. Waste of money.
--------------------
A very tasty and healthier version than from the local Chinese restaurants. The portion, calories, and lower salt are just right as a dinner. The chicken and vegetables are always tender and moist.There is a good portion of scrambled eggs and the "savory soy garlic sauce" over the rice is just the right amount and consistency. Currently its 2018 and my microwave is broken so I'm using my oven and baking this frozen dinner at 350 degrees for 35 minutes after having removed the frozen food from the microwave dish to a covered baking dish. It always comes out delicious and never too dry or watery.
--------------------
Wow, really surprised how good the chicken is in this dish.
--------------------
All of these meals are a bit small for a dinner for me but I add a little more rice and a side veggie and BINGO! What a great gluten free option!
--------------------
Sauce is pretty bland. Rice isn’t even fried. The whole name of this entree is a LIE!
--------------------
This looked great on the shelf but it had way too much carrots and sauce for my liking.
--------------------
I like this for a quick lunch. I’m GF so it’s nice to have a ready made meal. I have not experienced the watery rice others have mentioned.
--------------------
I bought this variety after a long time and the taste is no longer the same it used to be. It has so much soy sauce now that the actual taste of rice and chicken is almost gone. The amount is good and the cooking instructions are fine.
--------------------
This was very good. First time to try and so happy to have more gluten free options!
--------------------
I enjoyed this fried rice. There is plenty of chicken and veggies and the sauce has a great flavor. Great alternative to chinese takeout!
--------------------
Once again one of your meals come short.... This time around there were no eggs. Not even something that could resemble an egg and the Chicken was freezer burned... Dry and chewy. I had just bought this meal, so it wasn't a meal that had been laying in my freezer for long. Such a shame... I've bought this product before and loved it... I may just have been unlucky, but I seem to be very unlucky as of late with your meals.
--------------------
If you are looking for GF chicken fried rice, avoid buying this meal. It tastes more like chicken with garlic sauce. It tastes better if you remove most of the sauce before putting it back in the microwave. Try some of the other GF varieties.
--------------------
This is my third time buying this one and each and every time tastes great ! Tastes fresh chicken is all white tender meat and the veggies are delish.. this one is a winner !
--------------------
This was way too salty...luckily I didn't mix the sauce in with the rice so I had something to eat still for my lunch, but I didn't like the flavors. Needs to be a little sweeter, less salt. 680 mg of salt is to high...
--------------------
The sauce tastes like it was burned. Did they even taste this before they put it in a box and sold it. I eat frozen lunches all the time, but this is terrible.
--------------------
I can't be without the Chicken Fried Rice. One of my all time faves! Would also love the same recipe without the chicken or perhaps with tofu. Also, the Cashew Chicken would be so much better using the sauce in this one. The only thing I might change is to add just a touch more sauce.
--------------------
I love this Chicken Fried Rice Entree! I have eaten it as is and have at times used it as a base and have added extra veggies or cashew nuts to it for a more dinner. I like how it is seasoned and that it doesn't bother my stomach as some boxed meals tend to.
--------------------
A local Chinese restaurant closed and I always got their chicken fried rice. Nothing else would even come close to their food. I picked this up hoping it would taste okay, but instead it tasted amazing! Definitely my favorite from Lean Cuisine!!
--------------------
I love fried rice and thought this would be easy to make instead of ordering Chinese. This definitely did NOT taste like fried rice. It had more of a spicy taste to it. Very disappointed :(
--------------------
I think they changed the recipe. I had Lean Cuisine Chicken Fried Rice over a year ago and it was good. Now it is way too wet and very bland. It smelled great when it was done cooking but I had to add honey (that was all I had at work) to make it taste closer to what it smelled like.
--------------------
This was a horrible copy of any fried rice I have ever had. It was spicy. I like spicy, but not on my fried rice. The rice didn't have any of that delicious fried rice flavor, the sauce was plentiful, almost too much, which gave the entire dish a flavor, but not the flavor that you expect for Chinese fried rice. Take this one back to the drawing board Lean Cuisine! I would take this off the market immediately. It's a recipe for disappointment!
--------------------
I thought this was a perfect dish. It was light and filling. I will for sure be getting these again!
--------------------
Overall I liked it and it was really good. But I had to cook my own chicken because the chicken it came with was all fat. Couldn't chew it. Seems to be that way with many lean cuisine meals though..
--------------------
Since being diagnosed with celiac I was so happy to stumble across this. It is very good not horrible like most gluten free foods
--------------------
I absolutely like this recipe taste was good definitely buying again
--------------------
I wanted to try something different for dinner and the chicken fried rice looked so good! But then, I tried it and my mouth was on fire! If I knew it was spicy, I wouldnt have bought it.
--------------------
Chicken fried rice is my very favorite lean cuisine.
--------------------
Very flavorful and filling. Tastes like smoothing you would get from the Chinese restaurant.
--------------------
I really like this one and stock up on it frequently. The only thing I would suggest is for it to have a little more sauce.
--------------------
This is an example of the kind of frozen meal that makes me ask "who stunk up the kitchen?" Too strong bell pepper and just strange unidentifiable odor. I wouldn't want to try it since I have to leave the room when someone else cooks one.
--------------------
I'm currently eating this as I type this review. Rice is too mushy. Overall too wet for fried rice. Gristle on the chicken. Soy sauce added to the meal so I can't flavor it myself. No conventional oven instruction. Very disappointed.
--------------------
it taste a little off then i would expect it to taster like
--------------------
This is wonderful! I can eat healthy and still eat Fried Rice? Amazing! Great flavor!
--------------------
The chicken fried rice is filling and has a nice flavor. Not too sweet or salty.
--------------------
I enjoy taking this for lunch at least 3 or 4 times a month. It is tasty and the perfect amount of food.
--------------------
I bought this from a vending machine at work. Out of the 6 or 7 little pieces of chicken, 4 of them had gristle and fat attached. There was also a small chunk of chicken fat mixed in with the rest of it - ick. The taste of the food was fine but the chicken grossed me out.
--------------------
The sauce is really good! There is a good ratio of chicken and veggies to the rice. It is quite tasty.
--------------------
I don't know what everyone else is talking about here, but this one is my new-found fave! I love, love, love it! Tastes like authentic Chinese as much as it can for the low calorie-content. I love that it doesn't have brown rice. I usually despise brown rice in general. This one is tasty, feeling, good for the calorie content, and hearty! Yum-yum! Go Lean Cuisine! I appreciate the help with my weight management goals
--------------------
Really enjoyed the previous recipe and flavor. However, the new recipe has changed my mind on purchasing this product anymore.
--------------------
This was good after I added some salt & pepper to it
--------------------
The chicken fried rice is just ok, I probably have higher expectations of my fried rice. The portion size is just right, but I feel that the flavor was lacking. The vegetables seem to be of those similar to ones you find in the frozen packages. A suggestion would be to flash freeze real vegetables and consider brown rice as an option.
--------------------
I bought this thinking i would just try it but i love it, its my favorite so far
--------------------
I like the texture. Several reviews have commented that it is "watery" but that is probably from people who prefer their fried rice to be be more dry and with less moisture. I don't mind that but I prefer a "wetter" version like this one. I agree that it could use a little more spice and soy though. Overall, I like it. I have to have Gluten Free so this is one of the 12 GF Lean Cuisines I can eat. (More please) :)
--------------------
Fried rice is usually off limits due to high calories and fat. Now I can still have it and still watch my waist line. Plus, it's delicious!
--------------------
A couple pieces of the chicken were chewy and tasted odd. Otherwise delicious!
--------------------
Tasted fresh, a bit too much salt, but filling and interesting.
--------------------
The calorie count and price increased but the flavor did not. A little heavy on garlic for an Asian dish. It's okay just not as good as it used to be
--------------------
The meal was very watery and left an after taste that wasn't pleasant. I love Chicken Fried Rice and was excited to try this only to be let down.
--------------------
I really enjoyed this meal. I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty this offering was. There are nice sized chicken pieces & the flavor was good. Usually gluten free options are not that tasty or they are dry.
--------------------
Added a cup of peas and carrots! this was awesome. I forgot I was eating a lean cuisine.
--------------------
The chicken is chewy. Feels like extremely processed chicken versus actual chicken. The rice and veggies were OK.
--------------------
I had never tried the Chicken Fried Rice so I thought I'd buy it and try it. The sauce was a little spicy and even though I followed the cooking instructions correctly, the rice was very mushy. Now I can say I tried it but I can't say that I liked it. I'm going back to the Sesame Chicken. Much better!
--------------------
I tried this for the first time today because it's hard to find a good Chinese TV dinner. There was a very odd taste to the sauce and I could barely finish eating the entire dinner. I noticed that others said this tastes worse than the old recipe, but I have never tried the old version. Very disappointed.
--------------------
Like another reviewer said this is really bland and also watery. Nothing like the package looks on the outside. I would have liked more a soy sauce flavor and I would have accepted the watery-ness of it. The chicken was of a good quality and that was really the only redeeming thing about it
--------------------
I am glad that I read these reviews after I ate this. I found it to be very satisfying . I thought it had good flavor and was filling for a lunch. I will definitely buy this again!
--------------------
I was hungry for Chinese today and was at the store and saw this. It looked great until I pulled it out of the microwave to stir it. I noticed it was quite watery then. I continued to cook it for another minute and let it sit in the microwave for an additional minute, just like the package says. I brought it back to my desk at work and let it sit for a few more minutes hoping the rice would soak up some more of the water. It didn't. It looked kinda like soup. I had a couple of bites and it tasted bland. I'm not sure if that's from all the water or if that's normal. I followed directions to a T so I'm pretty sure it's not me.
--------------------
They just started carrying the GF Lean Cuisine in my stores. I wouldn't consider this a "fried" rice dish. The ingredients were all cooked well and I felt the portions were good, however this was so salty I literally choked on my first fork full.
--------------------
I don't know where all these haters came from but I could eat this LC every day. There's plenty of sauce, the chicken is tender, and it feels pretty close to real chinese food. It definitely takes care of my cravings and is a satisfying lunch for me.
--------------------
Just saying to all you haters: Best sauce and texture I have had in frozen entrees! It comes out slightly spicy, sweet, not dry or too wet, not burned or under. Enough chicken pieces and veggies. Wish the portion was bigger but its probably correct from a dietician.
--------------------
Trying this for the first time.. it is too salty... probably will not buy this one again.
--------------------
I thought it was delish and it was the first lean cuisine I have EVER had, trying to get real on being healthy..this was a WONDERFUL good impression :)
--------------------
I bought the chicken fried rice as I love it, but this is not fried (?) rice and the sauce was skimpy, not enough to cover the rice as well as flavorless. I couldn't finish it unfortunately. I do like some of your other menus, but not this.
--------------------
I tried this flavor today for lunch for the first time. I was not impressed and left feeling really disappointed. It was edible, but I didn't enjoy eating it. The sauce is just... flavorless. I tried adding salt but that didn't help either. The ingredients are good, but the sauce just ruined it. I will not buy this flavor again.
--------------------
This new recipe is not as good as the previous one AND it has more calories. I won't be buying again unless they revert to the old recipe.
--------------------
It's still a very good alternative to high calorie, high fat restaurant versions. However, the previous recipe tasted much better and was 40 calories less. (Previous recipe had more and tastier sauce, mildly spiced. The replacement recipe is spicier and has a less plentiful and less pleasant sauce.) In my view the old one was perfect while the new one is pretty good.
--------------------
The old chicken fried rice was fairly decent. This new recipe is awful and I didn't even finish eating it. Totally killed my appetite (but, maybe that was the intention? If so, DON'T do that again!!!!!). Definitely am crossing this one off my list. I've noticed several of the new recipes have increased the spicy-heat factor while reducing flavor. 2 thumbs down!!
--------------------
I have been looking for quick meals that are gluten free and this one is great!! I miss Chinese restaurants since being GF. This was a great reminder and not as many calories. Taste good too.
--------------------
I am confused how this product can be gluten free? Wheat is listed on the box.
--------------------
I really like this products, particularly because it isn't loaded with sugar like so many asian recipes. I would recommend two things; a little more sauce and brown rice option. There wasn't enough sauce to stir throughout the rice. The chicken was good. Very satisfying lunch.
--------------------
What a wonderful gluten free meal! I sprinkled some White Pepper on it and topped it with some Sweet Chili Sauce and ... bang ... at the flavor! Wow! Thoroughly impressed. I just love it! And, it's gluten free! And, way less calories than the chinese joint. LOVE!!!
--------------------
This was the only dish I purchased, it was the best tasting. And now the recipe changed, it has eggs and less sauce, its tasteless! Not only is it uneadible, its also 40 calories more than the previous tasty meal. BRING THE OLD ONE BACK! I BEG YOU.
--------------------
Tried this product today for the first time and was very disappointed. Bland and flavorless, except for the bits of limp green onion. Honestly, the worst Lean Cuisine meal I have tried. I ate it because I had nothing else at work, but will not buy again.
--------------------
This dish is great tasting. I keep it as a stock item in my fridge.
--------------------
Love it going back to Walmart to get some more willing to try something different
--------------------
I buy this often and it's very good. Although, I do add some soy sauce.
--------------------
I like Chicken pad Thai, but I was not a big fan of the taste. It was very blah for my taste. I wouldn't recommend this one to my friends that like a lot of flavor. It needs a bit more kick to it, it doesn't have that pad thai kick taste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I'm surprised how flavorful and tasty the chicken pad thai bowl is , a quick meal. When I'm in a rush , I just pop this in the microwave and it's easy to prepare and then ready in minutes to start eating. The flavors are great and very satisfying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This chicken pad thai bowl from lean cuisine is very convenient. It only needs a microwave for a few minutes. It is also less calories than other frozen food brands. I would purchase this again in other flavors too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This Lean Cuisine chicken pad Thai bowl was very convenient. It is easy to prepare by microwave and I do not have to worry about excessive calories like other frozen food brands. It also was delicious. I will be purchasing again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love lean cuisine and I am loving there new options. They have always been a healthier option but they just keep getting better. Packed with 22 grams of protein and a suitable portion size. The veggies are not soggy and stay crisp. Can’t wait to try the other varieties and have this one again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Lean Cuisine Bowls- Chicken Pad Thai is very convenient and delicious option for a quick meal. Super easy to heat, 3-4 minutes in the microwave was all this meal needed to be fully heated. It has white meat chicken, carrots, snap peas red peppers, egg and rice noodles in a Thai sauce and offers 22g of protein and 3g of fiber. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I wanted to try Lean Cuisine Chicken Pad Thai Bowl because I love all different types of bowls but wanted something that would be quick and easy. The Chicken Pad Thai Bowl was ok for a quick and easy meal but was not the best testing. My chicken was on the dry side and I was not fond of the flavor. I do love how it has 22g of protein which is very important and keeps you fuller longer. The other positive thing about this is bowl is that there is no artificial colors or flavors. If your looking for a quick, in a hurry meal then I would recommend this but just beware its not one of the best ones out there is my opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I tried this a while ago and it was very good. It wasn't spicey at all. The flavor is just great in it. It's the perfect size portion for one person to get filled up on. I would eat it again for sure. It was great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have always been a fan of lean cuisine, and I love pad thai, so when i saw they had this, I knew i had to try it. It's not knock your socks off, restaurant style pad thai, but it is super convenient and it does taste pretty good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I’m definitely going to get these again! I love pad Thai and I was surprised by how much I loved this, too, considering it is store bought. It truly tastes like pad Thai and doesn’t taste like anything low fat. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I'm sorry but, I did not like this version of a bowl of Pad Thai. The noodles turned to mush and all I could taste was a weird bitter sugary aftertaste. I could only stomach a few bites and tossed it in the trash. I love Lean Cuisine bowls but this one was a miss for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is actually a great meal in a bowl, the flavor is actually great and I love how it taste. At first I was skeptical on how the Chicken Pad Thai bowl was going to taste, but after trying it without the sauce first then trying with the sauce I love it. Nonetheless, this is a great meal to eat anytime especially on lunch or dinner. I love the different vegetables that makes this bowl taste awesome. Overall, I will recommend this to anyone whose looking for a healthy meal. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Chicken Pad Thai Bowl is a nice sized bowl but once it is microwaved the food cooks down a bit. I personally enjoy microwave dinners from time to time but this particular one,I did not. I think I will continue to purchase a few other Lean Cuisine dinners to try other varieties so I have a better opinion about the brand. I like the chicken and it gives me a nice amount of protein but the seasoning and taste was what i did not enjoy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Chicken Pad Thai Bowl by Lean Cuisine is not my favorite microwave dinner.I do most of the time enjoy these types of dinners.However this particular one I did not enjoy to be honest.I did like the bowl size but it was not full on the inside after it was cooked.I guess I will have to purchase a few of the other Lean Cuisine dinners before forming a solid opinion based from experience with only 1 dinner.Hopefully there will be others I can enjoy since this one I did not! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I always rely on something quick and easy to heat up for lunch, so I was very excited to try this new pad thai bowl! First off, I love pad thai, so I had high expectations for this frozen meal. It was quite easy to heat up and in less than 5 minutes, I had a deliciously smelling meal! I love that this product is high in protein, fiber, and vitamins. The noodles were perfectly cooked and there was an equal amount of chicken and veggies! It was so flavorful and tasted healthy, while having that authentic pad thai taste. I will definitely be purchasing more of these quick meals. They keep me full enough to get through the day, with no guilt at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I tried the Chicken Pad Thai Bowl and to me it was very flavorful and delicious. The portion was a nice size, but not for a person who is hangry. I like that I can pop it into the microwave and heat it up pretty fast for a quick meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This Lean Cuisine Chicken Pad Thai Bowl tastes pretty good. Very easy to prepare and easy to eat. It has a great flavor and good texture in the chicken. This was a little hard for me to find in the store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
As for the fact that it is supposed to be healthier and a better option for you, this bowl was not doing the "Pad Thai" name any justice. I love resturant Pad Thai, who doesn't? let me tell you this is not even close. This is mushy noodles, with chunks of frozen white chicken that you get in any frozen meal and some veggies, with a gross sauce. This was not worth my wild, I took one bite and threw it out. It was more of a stir fry - so I will not be back to get more, there are better LC dishes out there. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Lean cuisine Chicken Pad Thai bowl comes with white meat chicken,carrots, snow, rice noodles. The the chicken was pretty good, noodles turned out mushy and the sauce didn't taste like Pad Thai. The snow peas was very strong in taste the carrots was pretty good. I was really disappointed because I love Pad Thai. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

If you're looking for something that tastes exactly like you would get in a restaurant, then this chicken pad thai bowl isn't for you. If you're looking for something quick and easy that you can keep in your freezers for emergencies or to take to work, then you might like this meal. It tastes pretty good, and is good in a pinch. It's easy to heat up in a microwave and cooks evenly. It's not perfect, but it has flavors and ingredients I crave. I would buy it on occasion whenever I get a craving.

I am a fan of many of the Lean Cuisine meals already and I like to try new recipes when they come out. I recently tried the Chicken Pad Thai Bowl. It was quite tasty! I love the pre-measured amount. It makes it so easy to keep track of my calorie intake. I have tried numerous varieties of meals with other brands, but Lean Cuisine is the best tasting option in my opinion. I am a big fan of this Chicken Pad Thai Bowl. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This dinner is filling yet it’s full of vegetables and a light sauce that won’t weigh you down. I enjoyed eating this Chicken Pad Thai Bowl and would suggest it not only to those counting calories but anyone wanting a dinner with a lot of flavor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I was excited to try this since I love pad Thai and this looked like a quick easy fix when I had a sudden craving. It wasn’t bad.. but it also was a little bland. I doctored it up a little with a squeeze of lime and a dash of soy sauce and that really helped! I’d probably get it again as it is a quick filling meal and is decent considering it’s a frozen meal!

It was very easy to find this meal in the store. Sometimes I have trouble finding them because frozen meals are so hidden but I found this quickly.

I love this, it taste really good and is really easy to make for when you’re on the go. It is very high in protein which is awesome and the flavors are amazing. I would rather eat these meals than fast food any day when I’m at work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I had this before when it was in a cup instead of a bowl (or a smaller bowl) they added peppers and the entire taste of this bowl changed, and not for the better. I do not like this at all. I would not recommend this product. But I still like their other products, this one is a no from me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This was a yummy bowl for a quick lunch. I had run out of time to make something and grabbed this on my way to work. This was a nice change from other styles of frozen bowls. Very flavorful and filled me up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The thai sauce and overall flavor of this meal is the best compared to most pad thai frozen meals. The sauce does run very sweet versus savory. The vegetables and egg tastes genuine and not soggy. The ratio of noodles to vegetables is fair. The chicken was better than expected for a frozen meal but some pieces were rougher and harder than others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
With most frozen meals, you have to adjust your expectations but for the convenience factor, sometimes that's the best option. The taste was good, portion size is a little smaller but that's all personal preference. I would buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love what Lean Cuisine is doing, finding ways to fit customers needs, and the simplicity and convenience of these frozen meals, often goes with me to lunch at work. I absolutely adore Pad Thai, and no, this bowl is not what you will find at your favorite Thai restaurant, but honestly, it works to fill a craving. This particular bowl has chicken, rice noodles, carrots, snap peas, red peppers, egg, and of course the sauce. It is focused on being "high protein" with 22 grams for this meal, and you can clearly see the vitamins/minerals and their amounts in the back of the box. For my liking, it is a bit high on salt and sugar content, but I guess it's what worked for making it also taste good. It is all in your particular needs and preference.

I received this for a review. This was a tasty and moist Thai chicken bowl. A bit spicy but also filling. Bits of veggies and some heat. The chicken was moist and not dried out. Definatly would recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Doesn't taste like pad thai at all. It tastes and smells like sweet and sour chicken that they added noodles to in an attempt to pass it off as a new dish. I am not fooled.
--------------------
I really enjoyed this. I'm always looking for healthier options for a quick lunch or dinner. Lean Cuisine makes it so easy to find that healthier option. This Pad Thai is really tasty. It has lots of veggies and plenty of chicken. The sauce has a good flavor and goes really well with the noodles. I wasnt sure how the egg would be, because ive had bad experiences with other brands frozen eggs in the past, but these were really good and add alot to the bowl. Its super quick to make and very convenient. I definitely will be buying again and recommend you give it a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I've had this Lean Cuisine Chicken Pad Thai before and I didn't love it the first time. This time it isn't much better. It's pretty bland on its own and doesn't scream "authentic Thai flavor." The noodles are the best part of this dish. The chicken is very poor quality and is kind of hard to stomach. The veggies taste like flash frozen veggies but there are too many carrots for my liking. The flavor is lacking enough that I have to add my own soy sauce and a lil teriyaki and even a bit of sriracha. It definitely needs improvement, especially if it's supposed to taste like traditional pad Thai. There are many other Lean Cuisine options I would choose before this one as it does not properly represent the classic flavors of the dish it's supposed to be.

Oh my, why didn't I read some reviews before buying to two of these? I always like the Asian themed LC bowls but this one was a massive fail. Just a really odd texture and very "watery". I was rip roaring hungry but could only manage choking down about a 1/3rd of this one. I can't even really give the unopened one to a neighbor in good conscience .

Lean Cuisine Bowls- Chicken Pad Thai is a convenient and delicious option for a quick meal. I brought this meal to work for lunch, and it was super simple to take from ny freezer and toss in a travel bag into work. A quick 3-4 minutes in the microwave was all this meal needed to be fully heated throughout. This bowl contained white meat chicken, carrots, snap peas red peppers, egg and rice noodles in a thai sauce. This bowl contains 22g of protein and 3g of fiber but contains very few pieces of meat. If you are a meat lover, I recommend packing some extra chicken to toss into the bowl for an even heartier lunch. The seasoning was very tasty, but a little on the watery side. I did find it odd that anchovies are in the list of ingredients. I was satisfied at the end of my lunch. I recommend this product and would definitely get this bowl again.

I took this to work for lunch, I wish the cook time was a bit less. I prefer meals that are ready quickly because everyone in the office shares the same microwave.

Lean Cuisine Chicken Pad Thai Bowl Is a quick and easy meal that is perfect for on the go people. The taste is great and I’ve always trusted the Lean Cuisine name to provide quality foods.

Not too bad for someone who is losing weight! Not too salty nor sweet, just the way I like it. A good portion of food (you don’t want to eat too much either), got to make sure you don’t over heat it.

I was excited to try this chicken pad thai bowl from lean cuisine. It was easy to make. Pretty simple instructions. But I don't think I made it right sadly my noodles came out mushy.

I had been really bored with Lean Cuisine lately and had taken a break. I decided to buy some to have quick dinners when I work and my husband works and we need something quick. I saw these and immediately thought of my husband. He liked it and it smelled so good that I wanted to try it. I bought 2 more and had them for dinner tonight with my husband. They were actually quite good! They are slightly on the sweet side and my husband wishes there was a little more broth because the noodles can get a little sticky but this will DEFINITELY be something we will get again.

I thought the Chicken Pad Thai Bowl was pretty good. I liked the texture of the rice noodles, which cooked up well. The chicken had an overall good texture to it, and was tender. I felt like the vegetables were slightly a little over cooked, and I did not care for the red bell peppers in the mixture. The sauce itself was slightly sweet and spicy, which I enjoyed. The addition of the scrambled eggs was nice. The product was easy to prepare in just a matter of minutes, which is nice when you want something quick without having to cook on the stove top or heat up the oven.

I never thought I'd be giving a frozen meal a 5-star rating, but here I am, spreading the word that Lean Cousin Chicken Pad Thai Bowls are amazing. I can't believe how much flavor they had and how perfectly cooked everything was. I'm a big pad Thai fan, but I can be kind of picky. Lean Cousin not only met my expectations, but exceeded them -- now I can get my Thai fix at home, any time! The spice level was just right for my tastes and portion size was probably more responsible than I usually am with takeout. (Guess I'll just have to indulge more often!) Lean Cusine Chicken Pad Thai Bowls are a way healthier alternative to takeout and allowed me to enjoy one of my favorite dishes, guilt-free. I love that they can be made in just minutes in the microwave, perfect for a quick dinner on a late night. I'll definitely be grabbing more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Chicken Pad Thai Bowl by Lean Cuisine was good! I love the convenient packaging and it doesn't take long to heat. I love the variety Lean Cuisine has for their meals.

I was really impressed with the noodles as they were firm and not mushy. There is a perfect amount of sauce which is seasoned well although a bit thin for my liking. It is not overly sweet like some I have had. The downfall is, if you are expecting this to be restaurant quality, you are not going to be satisfied. If you accept it as a tasty Lean Cuisine dish then you will like it. Overall, it is a good bowl and for me better than some others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Not a fan of having to season my frozen meals. I think they should come already seasoned. I wanted to try thai chicken and yes I ate all the chicken. More chicken please!

I was very disappointed in the quality of the chicken in the meal. It was very rubbery. The sauce is watery.

--------------------
I see all these other bad reviews on here, now let's keep in mind people you didn't get this from a Thai restaurant so it shouldn't taste the same. I however thought this was a quick and easy substitute that was also very tasty! I have been searching for it since I bought it the first time.
--------------------
This new bowl was good, but could have a bit more flavor. I did love the veggies.
--------------------
I bought this to try it out as a lunch option, and boy was I shocked! It was just like ordering Thai takeout! Delicious flavor and nice, big chunks of white chicken pieces. My coworkers stopped by my office to ask where I ordered my lunch from!
--------------------
Chicken Pad Thai was my first experience with the new Lean Cuisine Bowls . . . and I will never buy that again. I did not enjoy this at all . . . it did not have any flavor and was nothing like Pad Thai. Please . . . change this recipe !
--------------------
Lean cuisine has migrated away from the small translucent white containers to a black bowl for this pad Thai. The pad Thai which previously had mushy noodles, is able to maintain it's consistency more in the spread out bowl, likely because less sauce for the noodles to cook in. The sauce is also an improvement, less stickly sweet than before and a nice bit of heat! Not a fan of the red peppers in it. However, it is still miles away from a real pad Thai. This used to be my least favorite but has now gone above the chicken teriyaki which is now dismal.
--------------------
I could not eat this. The noodles turned to mush, and all of the veggies were overcooked. The flavor might be ok, but the sauce is water. Into the trash.
--------------------
Honestly I liked the cup version they had before WAAYY better. Personal opinion. The sauce was not to my liking and I didn't like the added peppers. Overall it was on the tad spicy side rather than sweet. Of course I'm comparing this new version with the cup version, so I admit I have some bias in my opinion. Though I do appreciate the larger portion size in comparison to the cup but the cup size was good too.
--------------------
This meal simply had no flavor. I don't know what they put in the sauce but whatever the ingredients are they are wasted.
--------------------
I found this in the freezer section and was excited to try it. I really enjoyed the flavor but did add my own peanuts since they were not included. The chicken was tender and the noodles were just right after cooking it for the required 4 minutes and letting it rest for 1 minute. I appreciated there was not an overpowering vinegar flavor and overall would definately purchase again.
--------------------
I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews.. This was so delicious. It tasted fresh and not frozen, cooked just right ! The sauce is sweet and the veggies are fresh. The chicken gets cooked through on recommended time. The eggs are my favorite! I can't wait to try the others.
--------------------
Picked this up in a whim and boy am I glad I did the flavor was amazing and left me feeling full but not gross full
--------------------
This was truly inedible. The product is comprised of 1 inch long soggy noodles and mushy eggs that creates a disgusting much. Just looking at it, I could barely work up the courage to take a bite. While the taste wasn't awful in the end, the product was inedible because of the disgusting appearance. I cannot believe this passed your QA/QC process.
--------------------
I was excited to see Lean Cuisine Pad Thai and bought one right away, big mistake. The noodles were mush and there wasn't much taste. I still love the Chicken Parm, I guess I'll stick with it.
--------------------
I haven't had a Lean Cuisine in over 10 years but decided to try this because I love Pad Thai. This is surprisingly good! I will buy again.
--------------------
Probably the worst Lean Cuisine I’ve had. Tastes nothing like pad Thai, it’s watery, and the noodles degrade into a congealed mess by the time the cook time is done.

I bought this at store yesterday and was so excited to try this. I was ready for a saucy thai. There was no flavor at first and second bite. Unfortunately It was horrible. I had to put in trash. Hopefully the veggie stir fry is better.
--------------------
Absolutely delicious. Very filling and very tasty! I totally enjoy them
--------------------
Im actually shocked by all the bad reviews. I personally LOVE chicken pad Thai so I was super excited to this and try it! It honestly did not disappoint. Was it as good as the Thai place down the street from me? No. But it was still a darn good substitute. For those saying your noodles turned to mush cooked it too long. I cooked mine for 4 minutes and let it sit for one and the noodles turned out almost as good as the ones from the restaurant near me. Also please be aware that chicken pad Thai does have a sweetness to it even at restaurants. Its not just a lean cuisine thing. Overall I'm very happy with most of the products I get, especially this one. Hope youll continue it!
--------------------
I'm so glad they came out with these. The portion is just right and had a great flavor.
--------------------
I see all these reviews about how unpleasant the dish was, but as long as you follow 90% of the instructions it will turn out fine. I deviated by splitting up the 4 minute cooking time to stir halfway through, but my noodles weren’t mushy and everything was hot. It was an interesting taste, sort-of sweet, and I’ll consider buying it again (because I didn’t realize it was 400+ calories).
--------------------
While it's not your pad thai that you get from a restaurant or make at home, this was a decent quick fix. I added some hot sauce and soy sauce to take away the overpowering sweetness. Like other mention, there isn't much sauce and it's watery. I'd buy again, but I probably wouldn't recommend it unless you want to spice it up a bit.
--------------------
The idea of Pad Thai is great if it is done right. Always enjoy LC and I was excited to see them on the shelf and grabbed 2 and sadly, it was disappointment x2. The dish was watery and does not taste like pad thai at all. A bite into it reminded me why I should just cook pad thai myself.
--------------------
I have had this one more than once and really like it but today was a weird surprise noodles, veggies, sauce, and no chicken. I'm guessing the protein listed on the package was not so much.
--------------------
This is my favorite of the new Bowls. Very tasty and noodles are very good. Also, has a good amount of vegitables and chicken as well.
--------------------
Was scared to try based on the reviews but glad that I did while it was on sale. It’s really good!
--------------------
When previously in the taller white containers, this was one of my favorites, now switched to the black bowl, this is my least favorite and I won't be buying it again. I don't get any teryaki flavor at all with the chicken and the bowls as opposed to the cups have far less sauce. It was bland, I might as well as just had plain noodles with some hard broccoli (did not cook all the way through despite correct cooking time - likely because of minimal sauce now). They improved the pad Thai, but made this one worse. Very disappointed
--------------------
I very rarely give one-star reviews, but this dish unfortunately merits it. I frequently purchase of a variety of lean cuisine products and am generally satisfied with the vast majority of them. This product definitely does not reach that standard I usually associate with lean cuisine. The chicken texture was unpleasantly aerated and the teriyaki sauce lacked any flavor. The vegetables included were good, but could not make up for the rest. Hopefully lean cuisine will revise its recipe for this product and bring it in line with the quality of other products it sells.
--------------------
THIS MEAL WAS SO GOOD!! So flavorful! The chicken wasn’t weird, had great texture and consistency-sometimes chicken in these types of meals can taste fake or rubbery. I was so pleasantly surprised by this new meal! So sad I didn’t buy more as we are currently in a pandemic and frequent store visits aren’t happening. Loved this meal!
--------------------
I was excited for this but highly disappointed. The taste is overwhelmed by ginger, does not taste like teriyaki at all. Noodles are a little gummy. Portion size is good if you can stand to eat it.
--------------------
I was pleased with the noodles, however the sauce has little flavor, and the chicken was watery..has a weird texture. if you could improve, and up the flavor of the sauce this would be something i would buy more often
--------------------
I am literally obsessed with this!!!! Never stop making it!!!!
--------------------
I was really eager to try this meal as the container and the idea of chicken teriyaki caught my eye while searching for a healthy lunch option. I read the reviews but still wanted to give it a try. The look of it was very appetizing, however the lack of taste left much to say. It literally had no flavor and the whole meal was very disappointing. I could have seen myself purchasing more of these meals but what's the point if it doesn't taste like anything! Such a shame! You can do better Lean Cuisine!
--------------------
Unlike other frozen meals, this chicken teriyaki bowl from lean cuisine fills me up! The sauce is pretty good and I am pleased with how much chicken, broccoli, and carrots are in the dish (also cooked well). I also appreciate that I can re-use the container when I am finished with the meal. I would highly recommend that people try this!
--------------------
In comparison to other meals, this is more filling. However it is pretty lack luster on flavor. Teriyaki is a very strong flavor, one of my favorites, but this is rather bland. I feel like the coloration is more food coloring than it is soy sauce. Even low sodium soy sauce has more flavor than this. In a situation where I'm hungry and want something that isn't overly heavy in calories this is a decent enough meal, but it isn't something I'll be getting over and over again.
--------------------
Been eating this everyday for lunch at work. Took it out of the microwave and stirred it, NO sauce!!!! Needless to say I ate it anyway. Still love this dish.
--------------------
I bought this thinking "well maybe I'll try this one day when I do not have a lunch", well today was that day I had little to no expectations of a frozen meal to be tasty, boy was I disappointed! The noodles are flavorful, the eggs blend perfect in the mixture and the snap peas are crispy and not mushy or soggy like I expected! I love Thai and authentic Chinese, this did not disappoint! Please try it for yourself! Low sugar and calories..it's perfect!
--------------------
Lots of chicken and lots of veggies, good flavors!
--------------------
Decided to try this because I've been craving Asian food. Was pleasantly surprised, plenty of sauce, lots of chicken and packed with veggies. Will definitly purchase again.
--------------------
Just finished this for lunch and I will definitely be buying this again. Great flavor, very hearty and filling. Keep up the good work!
--------------------
Loved it! Very flavorful. A nice change from the regular meals.
--------------------
I am so happy with my purchase, This will become a staple at my home.
--------------------
I saw this at the store and was curious so I bought this and the pad thai (BF has not tried that yet). This one was okay. I think there could be room for improvement since I do like some of the LC dishes. For this, I think the sauce was on the salty side and I was expecting more of a teriyaki taste similar to teriyaki restaurants but I mostly tasted ginger. There was way too much sauce and not enough noodles. Also, I followed the reheating instruction and my noodles were soggy (from the sauce overload) and about half of the noodle portion was broken to smaller bits. My suggestion for the noodles would be to maybe blanch it before packaging. I would assume that between freezing the noodles and reheating it in the sauce that it will cook the noodles perfectly. Overall, it was okay for me. Other people may like it but I don't think this is one of my favorite LC creations.
--------------------
Excellent frozen meal. Great amount of broccoli usually when I buy a frozen mix or Chinese takeout there is one piece of broccoli. Everything was right texture and sauce was tasty, not too cloying like some teriyaki's. It was so good I was tempted to give a bad review in hopes of a freebie!!!!
--------------------
excellent, love it! delicious flavor, don't stop making it!
--------------------
Bought today! Was so filling and was delicious! Will buy again for sure
--------------------
Very good taste. Veggies perfect and the noodles were perfect as I like them kinda of sticky.
--------------------
This was terrible. So much sauce it was like soup. Hard noodles and very little chicken. Tossed it! And the other three I bought thinking I would love it. Not worth 9 points on weight watchers
--------------------
The noodles were soggy & several pieces of chicken had chewy/crunchy parts that I had to spit out. I should've read the label better before buying. To much added sugar and other unhealthy ingredients.
--------------------
This was nothing special. It was basically a typical tray meal in a bowl. It wasn't saucy enough, the noodles were mushy and the broccoli was under cooked. I love the bowl concept, but with soup or stew type recipes. A healthier and lower sodium version of Ramon Noodles with veggies and chicken would really hit the spot during the cold months.
--------------------
I've purchased this product several times and loved it. The consistency was good and it was my new favorite dish. Recently, when I've heated it up, like usual, the noodles stick together and are gummy. There isn't any sauce left over like there used to be. I don't know if Lean Cuisine did something or what. I'm just sad that I can't enjoy this anymore.
--------------------
I decided to try the stir fry bowls because I absolutely love asian food especially teriyaki. I wasn't sure what to expect, but when I tried it I was amazed. The sauce is very authentic tasting, and the noodles are a little soft and mushy, but they hold the meal together nicely. The veggies are delicious and I am pleased that I've found a tasty way to include some more vegetables in my day. The chicken is very good but if you don't stir it enough halfway through cooking it can get tough. Overall I would say great job LC and I'll continue to buy them. Please make more varieties like beef and broccoli for example or maybe orange chicken or sesame chicken.
--------------------
Normally I enjoy Lean Cuisine and saw these bowls and thought they looked good. Looks are deceptive. The chicken had a consistency of watery tofu and tasted awful. The sauce was very bland as well. The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth and I ended up throwing it away. Really disappointed with this one.
--------------------
I bought this today and though that this would be amazing. I usually like the meals by LC but this one is really the worst thing I ever had from a frozen meal. I Cooked it, cooked it longer, added pepper, nothing helped. It seems like just brown tasteless water and the chicken is more like tofu.
--------------------
I love this chicken teriyaki. The chicken is so juicy and tender. The vegetables taste fresh with the right amount of crunch. I highly recommend this dinner
--------------------
Not only is it great tasting but I love that i can rinse out and reuse or recycle the container!
--------------------
This would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the sauce - too watery and not alot of flavor - its the only downside!! The noodles - chicken and veggies were perfect !! I mean PERFECT !! C'mon Lean Cuisine - just adjust the sauce - please :)
--------------------
This is the best meal I've ever had of yours!!! It is delicious and filling!! Congratulations!!! I am looking forward to trying one of the other new meals!!
--------------------
I was skeptical at first whether this was going to taste good...but if FAR exceeded my expectations. It had huge chunks of chicken seasoned well but not overly done and not spicy but had flavor. It was balanced with the veggies and the noodles. Too many times you find all veggies in something like this. I was very satisfied and it was a big portion as well. I am hopeful that they add more flavors besides the three they currently have available. Liked that it was in a bowl as well. Easy to heat up and enjoy.
--------------------
Really wanted to like this. One star for the firm noodles and veggies. But totally lacked flavor, especially the chicken. . Just brown water in the bottom of the bowl. Very disappointing.
--------------------
Bought 10/10/2019, Hoping for another great Lean Cuisine Meal....Disappointment, water sauce, unknown chicken hunks( fatty skin) lot of carrots (cheap veggie) way to much salt, needs more of a natural taste, could be a work in progress ? Need to rethink this product, can be wonderful with some little something removed and something added.......
--------------------
The first one I bought was amazing, but as they say consistency is key... the second one was really just not it. The sauce was runny, and the chicken tasted off. Maybe the third time it'll be better because I really do love the first one I had! I'll still recommend only because I'm hoping the 2nd one was a fluke!
--------------------
I never buy ones with chicken because it's usually weird, and after trying the Pad Thai version and it being weird, I was apprehensive to buy this. This is hands down the best frozen meal I think I've had. The quantity is actually enough, the reviews about there being too much sauce, maybe they didn't cook long enough or let it sit afterwards because it is actually perfect. The chicken isn't even weird.
--------------------
After ditching pasta and bread for awhile, the concept of a bowl full of noodles was appealing! I’ve seen other frozen meals with noodles and expected more prep but remove the wrapper and lid and you’re good to go! The noodles were great, the veggies were fine but the chicken was iffy. I wish they would consider other comfort flavors like chicken or turkey gravy.
--------------------
I love chicken teriyaki and was excited to try this. I had to look at the reviews to see if others posted the same as I was surprised at how watery it was. I thought something was wrong with it. Even though it was watery, I still enjoyed it. Love Lean Cuisine brand.
--------------------
First time I've tried this and except for the sauce being a bit watery, it was soooo good. Lots of veg and chicken. Would have liked a thicker sauce. I have 2 more in the freezer so I'll see if maybe I just got one just a little not right sauce wise. I'd buy again...Yummy!
--------------------
I love LC and I'm always excited to try a new variety. When I saw this on the shelf I quickly grabbed 2 of them plus 2 of the Pad Thai (which I haven't tried yet). Wow, this missed the mark completely for me. I eat a lot of teriyaki and this just doesn't taste like any that I've ever had. To top it off, the noodles, although good, just don't work with such a watery sauce - I had stains all over my shirt by the time I had finished (thankfully, I had tried this at home and not work). So my fingers are crossed for the Pad Thai. But regardless, I have my ol' stand-bys to turn to!
--------------------
This tasted just like something you'd eat at a Chinese restaurant. The sauce was flavorable and the noodles were just right. The chicken was juicy, not like a lot of chicken that gets dried out when you microwave it. Very, Very yummy.
--------------------
I bought this thinking it would be an average substitute for take-out but it turned out to be AMAZING! It tastes just like the real thing! So yummy!
--------------------
I bought this a couple of weeks ago as a stand by when I didn't have anythibg for lunch . I finally tried it today and was very pleased . They was more than enough chicken and vegetables. The portion size was more than enough, very filling. Only concern is the sodium content.
--------------------
This was much better than I thought it would be. Right amount of sauce—noodles cooked perfect & plenty of chicken. Only draw back is the sodium content—I would like to try it with less sodium! Because of the sodium content, I will not be buying very often.
--------------------
Had the Chicken Teriyaki tonight for dinner, it was very good. I will buy again.
--------------------
I bought this because the package looked new and different! The chicken was good and the noodles were a nice texture. I felt the sauce was lacking in flavor. I didn't have soy sauce but I think that would have made it perfect!
--------------------
The packing caught my eye so I thought I'd give it a try. Better than I was expecting. Overall flavor was good, plenty of small chicken pieces and carrots (too many carrots IMO as I don't like them but I still eat them) and not enough broccoli or onions. My noodles cooked up just fine but I prefer them to be on the softer side and I thought the sauce was good and there was plenty to coat the noodles and veggies. Yes, there was sauce in the bottom but I would rather have more sauce than not enough. This would get my take out fix if I had an egg roll to go with it.
--------------------
I was excited about the new bowls from Lean Cuisine as I've been a long time fan of these meals. I was so disappointed! I cooked like stated and it was so watery and the noodles were far from cooked. So I put in for another minute. The noodles were a bit better but there was so much water that the whole works didn't have much flavor (although it smelled good!)
--------------------
I just bought this over the weekend. I teach and need a quick but tasty lunch. I am a picky eater for the most part. This is amazing.
--------------------
Bought on a whim...wish I had bought more! Will try other meals.
--------------------
I am a big fan of Lean Cuisine meals. This was a nice addition to their line of products. I weigh 230 and this cup gets me full. I am pleasantly surprised by how full I got.
--------------------
This was very flavorful. I loved this, as I love Chinese food, this was a wonderful way to curb those cravings!! Will definitely get again
--------------------
I was intrigueOk, I admit it, the packaging is what drew me into purchasing the Chicken Teriyaki. And wow, am I glad I did! This was DELISH! I love the textures of the broccoli, carrots and the noodles! And the taste is excellent - YUM! I loved the first container so much, I made sure to go to the grocery store the next day and stocked up on more. I used to be a die-hard fan of the french bread pizza - no more! This is an excellent new product!
--------------------
Very yummy compared to similar microwave noodles will continue to buy and hope they make them permanent!
--------------------
The flavor is really lacking in the sauce. No real teriyaki flavor. I ended up adding soy sauce for some flavor. The textures and the amount of food are excellent. Fix the sauce and it would be 5/5!
--------------------
What is the purpose of putting the lid under the container?
--------------------
I bought this product last night for dinner. Easy to prepare, the texture of the noodles, veggies and chicken were great. The sauce was just ok. I didn’t taste much teriyaki. I will recycle the plastic container for other leftovers. Lean Cuisine improve the sauce and you’ll have a winner.
--------------------
I am no longer able to eat your products anymore because of the high sodium content. The carbs are also too high.
--------------------
To much sodium. Lean cuisne need to be low in fat and salt
--------------------
I tried this last week and was pleasantly surprised by how good it tasted. It was not overly sweet or cloying and tasted close to good restaurant food.
--------------------
I thought it looked good but I was wrong. After several tasteless bites, I threw it in the trash.
--------------------
Has to much sodium, not very healthy so won't try.
--------------------
Too much sodium and way too many carbs. It tastes good, but I will never buy it again.
--------------------
I was thrilled to see this at the store yesterday and ran home to fix it. I was rather disappointed. I could not really taste the teriyaki, despite constant stirring. The chicken, vegetables, and noodles were good, but flavorless to me, just salty. I love teriyaki, but when labled like that, I expect to be able to taste it. First time I have been disappointed by Lean Cuisine meals.
--------------------
I just got this thought I would try it. It was very good and tasty. I love the bowl it came in and very easy to make, I will be buying more of these and the price is very reasonable.
--------------------
I enjoy buy new products. And lately, I've been craving Chinese food. I added fresh green onions and it was delicious and taste great. Also, like the fact that the sodium is perfect and the portion is satisfying. I will definitely buy a few more when I go grocery shopping.
--------------------
Just take off the lid and microwave in the tub. No venting, no mess. The chicken was moist and tender. The vegetables were crispy and first grade with lots of whole snap peas. I have also tried the chicken Thai and the all vegetable stir fry. I am definitely buying these again. These are my new favorite frozen entrees.
--------------------
It cooked up nicely and the vegetables stayed slightly crispy, too. No mushiness. Great taste and, unlike other product lines, affordable.
--------------------
Very happy with flavor and texture of noodles. Couldn’t this be sold in a pouch or paper bowl? Too many people don’t recycle.
--------------------
Tried this tonight for dinner. It is so good will def buy again
--------------------
This is the only Lean Cuisine noodle bowl I've tried so far, although the other two are sitting in my freezer. It's a surprising amount of food and I hope the calorie content of 310 is correct considering that the other two bowls are over 400 calories. The noodles and vegetables cook up perfectly. I'm afraid to try the Chicken Pad Thai, because so many people say that the noodles are mushy. I don't know why that would happen just to that entrée.
--------------------
Hello I tried the new bowl it was very flavorful and delicious.Chicken was nice bite size chucks.Will definitely be buying alot more of these..
--------------------
Saw this at Safeway and thought it looked really good, and it was amazing!! Gonna have to buy another one!
--------------------
On weight watchers and getting tired of the same ole limited meals.... i found this yesterday and oh my goodness soooooo good!!
--------------------
I like the sweet potatoes and portion size in this lean cuisine, but I can't wrap my head around the orange glaze sauce. It's way too sweet for this meal. Sweet potatoes, cranberries and a sweet sauce is overkill. Definitely needs a savory touch and I miss the gravy from the older smaller version.
--------------------
No longer able to purchase a favorite roast turkey and vegetables, I tried the new bowl. Looks are deceiving, the choice of sauce did not work!
--------------------
I have been eating these specifically for the portion size and combination of flavors. Lately there is no cranberries and they are much smaller. Yet the calorie count is the same. Not my favorite anymore.
--------------------
I love Lean Cuisine meals! The Roasted Turkey & Vegetable is one of my favorites. The turkey is tender and juicy and the vegetables are so crisp and fresh tasting. I really like that the entire meal is less than 200 calories, which helps me stay on track with my daily calorie limit. Lean Cuisine is my go to for frozen meals because not only do they taste great but there are many options to choose from. I really like the portions; I feel satisfied but not overly full after eating one meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love the convenience of Lean Cuisine meals. They help me maintain my diet while providing a great tasting meal. The Roasted Turkey & Vegetable is one of my favorites! The portions are perfect and the calories for the entire meal are under 200 so I stay on target with my daily calorie goals. The meat is tender and juicy and the vegetables, although frozen, taste fresh. Lean Cuisine is my go to for healthy, individual freezer meals because not only are they enjoyable but there are so many options. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
All of the reviews seem to be for the original “LEAN CUISINE COMFORT Roasted Turkey & Vegetables” which was amazing and delicious. This is no where near as good as that dinner. Please bring it back and stop using the reviews for that dinner, THIS ONE DOESNT EVEN HAVE GRAVY it’s a freaking sham!
--------------------
Bring back the old version!!! This new version is yuck. Here's why: 1) orange flavor does not go well with turkey and gravy 2) too much calories 3) too much salt 4) everything is mixed into a bowl 5) gravy is flavored with orange and balsamic 6) no longer "lean"...bring back the old version. What were you thinking replacing a delicious turkey and gravy with this yucky version!!!
--------------------
I’m a big fan of sweet potatoes, turkey and cranberries. I thought I would give this a try. I wasn’t disappointed, I will buy it again.
--------------------
I ate the previous version of Roasted Turkey & Vegetables for lunch at least once a week. It was nutritious, low carb, low calorie, and satisfying. No longer. You increased the portion size and the number one ingredient is now sweet potatoes! I bought the last few packages I could find of the old version. You've ruined so many versions of my favorites by increasing the calories and carbs. I'll have to go elsewhere, I guess, which makes me sad.
--------------------
I bought this the other day to take to work, and I wasn't very pleased. The turkey was tough, and there was just a sprinkle of sweet potatoes....and every one of them was hard. I don't think I'll be purchasing this again, but I will say that the sauce is good.
--------------------
I loved the old version that had turkey on one side and green beans on the other. This new version in the bowl has too many carrots and the gravy isn't as good. I won't buy it again.
--------------------
Not the best tasting frozen dinner, I've ever had. The quantity was small and the meat didn't taste that fresh. I probably wouldnt buy this again. Also I'd rather drink a protein shake for the same amount of calories and nutritional value. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Turkey in the meal was very tender and had a good taste. The veggies were cooked well too, they tasted like typical frozen veggies. I could have added a little salt, but I chose not too since it tasted okay without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I'm an RN, on my feet and on the go at least 12 hours a day when I'm on shift. That said, I'm always trying to find quick, easy and healthy ways to basically eat on the go. I am not normally a frozen meal eater because I i like to eat fresh as often as I can but I am so glad I trusted my instincts. This roasted turkey with veggies, bowl was amazing! It honestly tasted almost as good as homemade. The vegetables were tender but not over cooked and seasoned perfectly. The turkey had a lovely roasted flavor and was surprisingly moist. I was completely amazed at how delicious the whole thing was, and how great the price! I am definitely making this a regular part of my lunch routine and I can't wait to taste the other selections they have. Lunch just got very delicious! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
One of few products with not as many carbs. Carbs mostly come from orange sauce. Enjoyable meal. Green beans were firm not mushy nor has aftertaste-from-can. Take note though that 'More ounces line for Lean cuisine" is very hard to find. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This frozen meal was pretty tasty. The turkey meat wasn’t dry, the vegetables was cooked perfectly, and it totally filled me up. This is a meal I can eat at hone when I don’t feel like cooking or I can take it to work for lunch. It totally met my expectations for a frozen meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I received the roasted turkey and vegetable bowl for free from tryit sampling for my honest review. This meal was really very good. The turkey was all white meat and it was juicy and very tasty. The vegetables were crisp and tasted fresh. Great portion size. One of the best frozen foods I've had. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This roasted turkey and vegetable bowl was actually really good for a frozen meal. The turkey was lean, juicy and flavorful. The gravy was on par with homemade Thanksgiving style gravy. I used a piece of bread to clear my plate. Vegetables tasted fresh and had good texture, not soft or soggy at all. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was a tad on the salty side for me. That's just preference so this may be perfect for you if you prefer your food on the salty side. An addition of fresh ground pepper set this off! Great wholesome meal for when you're in a hurry or anytime you're in the mood for some good turkey.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I received the More Cuisine/Lean Cuisine Roasted Turkey & Vegtable Bowl and It was Perfect. The larger portion size left me feeling satisified and of course it tasted great. I Plan to pick up a few more of these very soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Lean Cuisine Roasted Turkey &Vegetable Bowl comes in a great portioned size that fills me up. I like that the turkey is juicy and tender, and has plenty of tasty gravy. The green beans could be a little more flavorful but they had great texture and consistency. This is one of my favorite Lean Cuisine mesls I like to get. I definitely recommend trying Lean Cuisine because they have a great selection of products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I am pretty picky about frozen dinners and was pleasantly surprised with this one. The first thing I noticed was the turkey- the pieces were thicker and hearty then I assumed they would be, also very tender and very filling. I had to had some salt to the vegetables but that's not a deal breaker. For the amount or calories this meal not only satisfied my hunger but was enjoyable as well. I will definitely purchase in the future ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love this Lean Cuisine meal. I am always watching my weight and I track my food points. This meal is very low points so it’s perfect for me. I eat one for lunch every day. It’s the perfect portion size. It fills me up and it tastes great! It’s super easy to cook in the microwave. I am so impressed with their Comfort food line. I hope they keep adding to it! The taste is fantastic! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Frozen, prepared meals like the type that Lean Cuisine offers, are not foods that I am a huge fan of in general. As per my suspicions, I found this meal to be a bit rubbery, tasted fake and was just overall distasteful. Water is the second ingredient in this meal, which could be why it was so bland throughout. I sincerely had higher hopes for the variety of this meal over others I’d tried in the past. After all, how can you screw up turkey and gravy? To be honest, the turkey and gravy were actually the only part of the meal that had good flavor, despite how bland it was. The combination of green beens and cranberries was not a good one, in my opinion. The cranberries were way too hard and chewy compared to the mushy green beans and even mushier almond slivers, of which I counted only two in the entire serving! This entire meal could have been improved by the smallest amount of spice from either salt or pepper or literally anything else. There was also a fake butter flavor that I guessed was sprayed on everything. The only good thing, I suppose, one could gather from eating this meal is knowing they filled up with real food, despite the many added preservatives, etc. And that the real food was only 190 calories and 6 grams of fat. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Have tried several frozen turkey meals - always very bland. This was great!! The cranberries really gave it a nice twist!!
--------------------
I actually have nothing against frozen meals. In fact I have my favorites so I was skeptical of something meant to be lower in calories but I was really pleasantly surprised. Firstly, the amount of gravy is super generous which makes the turkey nice and moist. The gravy is savory and salty, rich and smooth. The turkey was nice breast meat no weird unidentifiable pieces or grisly bits. The veggies were outstanding. Crisp, flavorful and the cranberry combination was really delicious. For a quick meal I’d definitely buy this again. My kids loved it too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I am a very busy mom of three and also care for my disabled father (wouldn't have it any other way!) I work in education and my lunches usually consisted of whatever granola bar I was able to grab hold of. I've always enjoyed Lean Cuisine, but they've really outdone themselves! The roasted turkey and vegetable bowl was amazing. The vegetables were not bland or overly cooked. They were perfect! The turkey was tender and the flavor was spot on. I returned to class feeling both full and content. And since then, I've stocked my freezer with more. If you need a quick meal that tastes amazing AND is healthy, you have to try these!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The turkey is tasty and tastes fresh. If those are mushrooms I like them too. Good quality green beans. They are crispy and fresh with slivered almonds and cranberries that add a nice texture. I added a small roll to soak up the gravy. And less than 200 calories! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I bought this dinner 2 weeks ago at a food lion. I had to throw it in the trash after tasting it. The mixture of green beans, turkey, cranberries, gravy and sweet potatoes all mixed up in a bowl was so gross! So disappointed!
--------------------
My husband really liked the Roasted Turkey & Vegetable Bowl by lean cuisine. He likes to try new things for lunch. And he couldnt wait to try this one. Within minutes you have a full size entree with tons of flavor. There’s nothing better then getting a home cooked meal that doesn’t take hours to prepare. I would recommend this to all my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I really glad to have found a flavorful microwavable meal. I found the portion perfect for lunch and these are wonderful to take into work. Everyone in my breakroom thinks they are smelling home cooked meal when I heat this up. Im horrible at counting calories, and buying these meals really helps with that!

This was surprisingly delicious. I like that it is healthy and just the perfect size for one person. The turkey and vegetables were seasoned perfect and not bland or over seasoned. I will be purchasing more of these for my family. They’re great for lunch or even dinners when you’re too busy to cook. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
There is nothing special about this tv dinner. It is basically like all the other available on the market. That is not to say it was bad. It is just average. I would buy it again. Nothing beats convenience after a long day of work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This Lean Cuisine meal was quite enjoyable. The beans with slivered almonds and cranberries are delicious, there were barely 4 pieces of cranberries in there. I didnt liked greens beans until I ate these!! Very tasty and nice to have a good vegetables. The turkey breast is tender and delicious. A perfect meal, the turkey and vegetables are healthy and tasty. The gravy is ok, but the texture and the smell makes me hungry.. The aroma is like having a big dinner in a fancy restaurant, Delicious with low carb and low calories, great combination. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I enjoyed this meal. The turkey was very moist to my surprise. I enjoyed the blend of green beans and almond it was not to sweet with the cranberries. The cranberries gave this meal a different flavor. I love the portion that was in the meal. Lean Cuisine has step up their game with this meal. Excellent for watching what you eat and portion control. I would recommend to my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I was very impressed with the quality of my Lean Cuisine Roasted Turkey and Vegetable Bowl. It is only 190 calories, so, if you are counting calories, this is a good choice. I liked the meal a lot, but, especially felt like the cranberries and almonds in the green beans felt more like a gourmet or homemade meal. This is fairly filling, I did have some fresh fruit as a side with this, which made my meal complete and filling. Flavorful and definitely a better tv dinner option than many I have tried in the past. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Very happy with this and look forward to purchasing more of them! These are perfect for lunch when my husband is at work and the kids are at school. Delicious, filling, and just the right size. Yum!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this delicious Lean Cuisine Roasted Turkey and Gravy last week and it is so full of flavor.The turkey is tender and the gravy tastes homemade.It truly is comfort food at its best.I have always loved Lean Cuisine products and this one didnt disappoint!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I normally am not a fan of orange flavor but this was an excellent tasting dish. The orange isn’t over powering and complements the turkey very well. I will be buying more of these. Even my 6 year old grandson loved it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This turkey and vegetable bowl was quite good. I never would have thought of putting cranberries in it but it was a great addition. I'm a bit of a big eater so I had to have a little something else with it for lunch. It definitely can't get any easier than this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I tried the roasted turkey and vegetable bowl I thought the meal was decent and tasted pretty good better than other frozen meals I have tried in the past! Good options if you are looking for something quick and healthy to eat. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Lean Cuisine Comfort Roasted Turkey & Vegetable Bowl is an enjoyable high quality product, convenient, very nutritional, tasty, with low calories, unique flavor and 15 g of protein. This product impressed me for its convenience, presenting as a great option for someone that often has no time to cook like myself and needs a nutritional fast meal that tastes delicious. I highly recommend Lean Cuisine meals, and I am a big fan of this new product! You should get it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I was hopeful, as I always am when buying "easy" food. This lean cuisine was no different than the others. The turkey wasn't good at all. The veggies were good though! The turkey tasted as it is, processed. It's fine for a quick fix when you don't have time to meal prep but that's about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this meal and it tastes great!! I went and bought a few for my family and ithey love them. Taste amazing!! I highly recommend this product to anyone. It's very nutritional also. The young kids love them also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Roasted Turkey& Vegetable bowl is my new go to when I need a quick bite to eat. It is filling and satisfying to eat, but without an over abundance of calories. It feels like you are eating a home cooked meal! I will be buying these and taking them to work with me! Yum! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Roasted Turkey and Vegetables is by far my favorite thing to eat. The turkey is tender and juicy with a lovely texture and the green beans are deliciously snappy and fresh tasting in a delicious gravy. I loved how quick and easy it was to warm up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Just tried the More version which is IMO a disaster. Too much sodium, too much sugar and turkey and orange sauce? Yuck. Why a buzzillion cuts of sweet potato? Too much starch. Never buy it again. Glad I at least could recycle the box but I had to look for another supper to eat.
--------------------
I was honestly so surprised by how good this tasted! The flavor was fantastic and it is definitely something I’d eat again. My only criticism is that the portion size is kind of small. I was still hungry afterwards so I’d probably eat something else with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I'm diabetic so eating low carb meals is necessary for me but I find it challenging to find healthy, tasty meals that are also low in carbs. The roasted turkey & vegetable bowl met both of those needs and it also tastes good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This was pretty good, considering the amount of calories. I wish that there had been a little more turkey, more cranberries, and a little less gravy (only because I'm really not a gravy person) but the overall flavor and textures of everything was good. I don't feel like this is a super-filling meal but it's great for a light, easy lunch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I often eat easy and healthy meals like this for lunch. It’s such a simple heat and eat product. Lean Cuisine has so many varieties to choose from too... from pasta to poultry and steak to Meccan. This Roasted Turkey & Vegetable is one of my faves. It’s very low calorie, so it fits in with my diet well. The turkey is tender and flavorful with just the right amount of gravy. The green beans are crisp, and are mixed with almonds and cranberries for a nice texture and flavor with each bite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This meal was really good. It was easy to prepare in less then 5 minutes with simple directions to follow. It had full flavor. The potatoes and turkey were seasoned and flavorful and the beans were still crisp despite being microwaved. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Is product is decent. It cooks evenly and tastes acceptable. It is essentially what you would expect from tried and true Lean cuisine meal. The vegetables were very good. The turkey was passable. 6/10 would eat again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is my 1st time trying one of the lean cuisine meals. I opted to cook mine in the oven. I think they taste better that way. It does not take long at all. The Turkey was so tender and moist. The beans were good. I think adding the slivers of almonds was a great choice. It just made the veggies for me. Trying this one product has now led to a new loyal customer. I will be purchasing other meals and look forward to trying them all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I tried the More Cuisine/Lean Cuisine Roasted Turkey & Vegetable Bowl. The heating instructions and nutritional information is easily accessible on the box. I followed the preparations as followed on packaging. Each portion had it's own savor to enrich the tastebuds. The seasoning is robust and enlightening. The dish is fulfilling and tasteful. The More Cuisine/Lean Cuisine Roasted Turkey & Vegetable Bowl is a savory meal that is convenient. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I am not a huge fan of "frozen meals", that being said I was taken back by the variety and quality up for offer through Lean Cuisine. Healthy and well balanced, they are perfect alone or with small additions, depending on your taste. I added a 1/2 cup white rice to complete my meal. It was delicious and filling. Very much different than the mainstream frozen foods I see in the shops. Lean Cuisine is perfect as a lunch or dinner, the meals cook quickly and easily, giving me back missed time from regular meal preparation. I definitely recommend as a quick meal replacement to anyone who like me, prefers good taste and quick timing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I really liked the roasted turkey and vegetable bowl. This was my first time having sweet potatoes in a microwave meal, but they were delicious. I liked all of the flavors together. It's a great microwave meal if you're looking for a balanced, and delicious, meal. It's nice knowing there are options for healthy, quick meals when you're in a hurry and don't have time to make something more substantial. I definitely recommend this meal and I'm planning on trying the Four Cheese Tortellini with Pesto Sauce next. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have always love lean Cuisine, but this Turkey veggie bowl is amazing! It tastes great & fills you up. I have bought 5 more to keep at my office, for a healthy hot meal. Highly recommend if you're looking for a quick, great tasting, healthy meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I am so glad that this Lean Cuisine frozen meal contains twenty percent more ounces with the same delicious, healthy ingredients. I had this for lunch and was completely satiated and did not have the urge to snack before dinner. I will definitely be stocking my freezer with more of these meals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I was surprised at how good this actually tasted. Not overly garlicky like most prepackaged frozen meals. I wish it had more gravy, but that's just a me thing. I love gravy. The turkey was moist and favorable.The green bean were ok. As with most frozen veggies, they lose something when they are microwaved. But still tasted good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love the flavor of the orange balsamic sauce in this turkey bowl. It has such a clean, new taste. It's low calorie with 190 calories and has 15 grams of protein. It's nice to have sweet potatoes as an option as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This one is a quick go to for lunches while at work. I have a short lunch so these are pretty quick and durable so I can bring to my desk and get back to work if needed. Quick clean up and throw away.
--------------------
I love the Healthy Choice Bowls, they are always delicious and always taste fresh. If I had to choose, the Healthy Choice brand would be the one I pick over any other brand. Their selection is amazing and they are actually good for you. Not to mention they are always coming out with new meals and new flavors. They would be in my top 10 easy meals.
--------------------
This particular flavor, along with the full line of low carb lifestyle products Healthy Choice has come out with, have become my go-to work-from-home lunch dish to prepare on-the-go. These ensure Im full and satisfied to continue on with my day!
--------------------
Really scrumptious, fresh snappy veg. Great for a quick, hot lunch when you can't prep yourself. Portion size leaves a bit to be desired, but it's not bad.
--------------------
I love this as an easy meal for lunch or even dinner if I am in a rush, it is not overly salty like other brands, very affordable and tasty. The portion size is good for lunch or a smaller dinner, and I would highly recommend it to anyone! Overall good quality.
--------------------
Very good frozen food fast cooked and desirable my whole family likes this they can eat these every single day it is fast for them to cook so they eat this all the time Can never go wrong with healthy food
--------------------
Great go to for when I dont feel like cooking or dont have time, always satisfies.
--------------------
dont have time to cut vegetables this was fast and easy i liked the colors and taste of food
--------------------
Microwavable, great taste, great portion. Recommend totally for a one person meal. Just takes about 7 minutes to cook in the microwave.
--------------------
This is a great quick meal! The sauce is well seasoned, the chicken is moist and the veggies are not mushy. This portion is the perfect size for a good meal that won't leave you hungry or stuffed. Definitely a good standby. We like to add a little soy sauce to boost the flavor
--------------------
This has been one of my top ten favorite because honestly who doesnt love some good chicken with some good veggies , has a very good delicious taste. Easy to prepare I will definitely buy it again soon.
--------------------
These meals are great for a quick fix for dinner. I love all the pasta steamer meals. They are a healthy choice except for the high sodium content in these meals. They do however have good flavor and are convenient. I would definitely purchase again
--------------------
I love it. It tastes so good and it is such a good filling portion.I love how it tastes. It taste just how you would get it at a good restaurant. I completely recommend it.
--------------------
Super delicious!! However, I was still hungry cause skinny girl needs more meat on her bones! Guess that's the "Healthy Voice" part I'd like to see a little more everything in this meal! When I'm craving this, buy it as a linner (between lunch and dinner meal)!
--------------------
This is a very good meal as far as frozen meals go. More healthy than most. Pop it in the microwave and dinner is done. Would recommed
--------------------
Great for work. Pop them in and have a filling meal with in minutes !!! Tasteful and easy to make
--------------------
If you are ever craving Chinese food, but do not feel like paying the store price or making it yourself, I highly highly recommend this product. It is delicious and nutritious for a frozen meal. The flavor is spot on and overall I am very satisfied with this product
--------------------
Pretty decent in a pinch at the office. Terrible packaging waste. I hope they find a better way. I’ll stick to the Recycled paper bowls. Salty
--------------------
Eating healthy is hard when you are so busy! but these yummy little guys are a way to eat healthy and its yummy! a plus is it is a quick meal to make!
--------------------
These are so yummy for such a quick and easy meal! Theyre pretty affordable and nicely portioned!
--------------------
When Im short of time this is one of my favorite quick meals. The veggies are crispy and the chicken is good.
--------------------
Tastes great AND its healthy! Low amount of calories, the flavor isnt the best Ive ever had, but its great for a frozen meal
--------------------
Great for one of those nights that you dont feel like cooking or running somewhere. If it had more sauce, I would give it 5 stars.
--------------------
The flavor is wonderful and not over powering. The veggies also taste amazing and fresh as well. Would recommend to anyone whos trying to eat better, but doesnt have a chance to cook all the time.
--------------------
Who needs takeout when authentic Chinese flavor is in your freezer! The portion is perfect and is just enough to hit the spot.
--------------------
a super easy dinner for anyone the flavors in the product is absolutely amazing i could eat this everyday and still be excited when i smell that smell 10/10 strongly recommend i promise you wont regret it
--------------------
I try to avoid frozen meals but when Im burnt out or have not time these come in handy. They taste good and have decent ingredients but watch out for sodium. They are affordable and are done in a matter of minutes.
--------------------
Not very flavorful. Broccoli was very soft, kind of fell apart in your mouth. The chicken just kinda tasted frozen, you know? It felt healthy though which was the goal! Its nice to know you can quickly have a healthy meal right before you.
--------------------
I love stir fry and this is only 1 point for those on Weight Watchers! It's a tasty choice for lunch. I've gotten this flavor a lot, but sometimes I'm disappointed in the broccoli being mostly/all stems.
--------------------
Its my personal favorite and go-to lunch/dinner when time is short! Tastes good, its not awful for you, its a win.
--------------------
Great food and great flavor but it wasnt very filling due to lack of carbs. The bowl was high in protein and low cal, as well as meeting most of my dietary needs.
--------------------
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT SO MUCH! ITS SO GREAT, SO YUMMY!!!! VERY FILLING!
--------------------
Great for a frozen meal. I like the steamer bowls. Things stay fresh tasting and not mushy. This one is pretty filling too with the chicken and the edamame.
--------------------
I eat this at least 3 times a week for lunch it is one point on my Weight Watchers plan
--------------------
I used to buy these every time we went grocery shopping because they were delicious and easy to make. Nowadays I can barely get through them. I don't know what's happened to the chicken but it has a bad fishy taste to some of the pieces and it's very unappetizing.
--------------------
A LOT of the broccoli stems which were so woody and crunchy, but not crunchy in a good way. Very little of the florets. Flavor was okay but could not overcome the woody broccoli. I will not purchase again.
--------------------
Yummy option for a quick grain free lunch! Nice variety of veggies, good sauce, and nice big pieces of chicken. Overall super happy with this product! Would definitely buy again! #lunchtime #letseat #meals #food
--------------------
I had this for lunch today, and had to add soy sauce for flavor. The problem was that it super watered down. There was 1/8 cup of watery sauce, where the rice drowned. The amount of broccoli was minimal. Most Healthy Choice steamers are good, but this one needs to be retired permanently.
--------------------
I really love this dish. I.usually don't like frozen chicken due to the consistency, but the chicken is delicious. I ate the entire dish, which can be difficult because I had a gastric sleeve. I love it and it is a good source of protein. This is my favorite new meal.
--------------------
Bought this today to try. Won’t buy again. Minimal flavor at best.
--------------------
The broccoli in the dinners are just full of stems no florets. Otherwise the taste is good and not many carbs. I am a diabetic and that’s a good dinner to choose.
--------------------
I could eat this everday for lunch and probably will now that I found it. You can add a little brown rice as well and it is so satisfying!
--------------------
In contract to most Healthy Choice products, this one tastes sweet enough to almost be dessert (exaggerating), and reading the label reveals it has 8 g of sugar, including 6 g of added sugar. There is no excuse for that.
--------------------
I bought a bowl to take to work for dinner. What a joke, there is like nothing in it! I’ll be lucky if I get 3 spoonfuls from it.
--------------------
Didn’t look anything like the picture on the box..
--------------------
I'm not really big on meat. Especially frozen meat from "tv" dinners. Normally I will eat a very small portion of meat and mostly vegetables. I've found that most frozen dinner meats are just horrible. To me anyway, considering my wariness of meat. However, the chicken in this is absolutely AMAZING!! mixed with the sweet and tangy sauce and garden variety vegetables, this frozen dinner takes the cake. I ABSOLUTELY loved the sauce in this. The only downfall I had to this dinner, and I've had 2 of them so far, is that I didnt get much broccoli florets with it. It was filled with stems. I was thinking maybe it was just the one that I had eaten so the next day I cooked the other one I had and unfortunately, it was the same way. I loved this dinner but I would recommend adding more florets, less stems. Other than that, it was delicious!!!
--------------------
This is a good option for low carb diet. Please make more flavours!!!
--------------------
I enjoyed this meal, although I did find myself craving carbs after it, as the amount of protein makes it pretty filling. The sauce is also nice as others have noted. I added more broccoli and hot sauce to it to add bulk and spice, which turned out nicely. I think the dish could be improved if the carrots were diced or chopped a bit more.
--------------------
Healthy choice is a great name. Right on target. Best box stir fry so far. Comes package with sauce below in a separate bowl. The rest sits in a steamer (2 piece cooking bowl).
--------------------
Love the taste of this but hated biting into a piece of chicken with the bone in it . Thank goodness I chew my food up slowly . Not sure if Iâll have these again . Very scary .
--------------------
The sauce is tasty, but it does not help the dish as it's hardly noticeable. Looks like it needs more sauce or something stronger.

I have loved most of the Cafe Steamers and Simply Steamers, but this one was not my favorite. It tasted ok first, but there is a nasty after taste. Reminded me of what cat pee would taste like. I will not get this one again. I will stick the the other ones I like better.

I LOVE this meal and eat it a couple times a week.  But I was disappointed when they changed the broccoli to be a mix of cuts and florets vs. just florets before.  The cuts do not cook as well, leaving a hard crunch and less flavor.  I really wish they would change it back.
--------------------
Really good flavor and good choice of veggies!

I know half the world is usually on a diet, but for those of us that have had bariatric surgery, these are the perfect meal! I had gastric sleeve four years ago and have lost over 127 pounds. All the Simply Steamers that are just protein and veggies hit all the marks for exactly what I am supposed to eat. Portion size - it's actually a bit much so I eat the protein out first and then fill in with the veggies. Sauce - bariatric patients need moisture in their foods for it to not upset their tummies and there is plenty in here. Nut Values are on point and all without sacrificing flavor! Thank You Healthy Choice, you have made my life so much easier. I have tried the Broccoli Alfredo Chicken too and it rocks as well. You should market these to bariatric patients!!
--------------------
Very bland in taste. Needs a lot more flavor.

I put off on buying one of these for a while since I thought microwaving it would make the meat taste rubbery. I was pleasantly surprised the chicken tasted as fresh as oven-baked chicken does. I've steamed a different brand of broccoli in the microwave before and it had no flavor, while the broccoli in this dish tasted great. I have ARFID (basically picky eating) so I was really, really surprised to like every part of this meal. Even the sauce was good. The only thing I'd change is the amount of red bell pepper slices. It didn't seem like there was very much compared to the other ingredients.

I have tried many frozen meals and this one was very enjoyable--the kind of meal that you feel grateful to have found, you savor each bite, and wish you would have bought more of while at the grocery store. Now my problem is trying to find the store that I bought it at. Unfortunately, my area grocers do not all carry this one. I hope it is not discontinued--that seems to be my luck. The quality of ingredients has been the best so far compared to other brands. You can actually eat all of the vegetables instead of finding just some all-too-hard inedible stems that pass for leafy vegetables. It's great. I would have thought this had been take-out if it was placed before me.

One of my favorite simply steamers meals! Very tasty, low calories, low fat, and low sodium. Plus it's quick and easy to make. A bit pricey, but worth it for the quality you are getting. I would repurchase again for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!

The Veggies cook up nicely the sauce is perfect. A tasty meal when you don't have time to cook and don't want to eat vending machine food. I enjoyed it and it held me over till dinner. It was also nice texture.

Yeah, so like I lift weights and Iâm into fitness and these bowls definitely come in clutch when Iâm on the run and donât have much time to cook. Great flavor and fresh food! Small portion so it keeps you feeling light and itâs healthy. Good amount of protein and less carbs. 190 calories is nothing so they really have me loving these bowls.

I had this Saturday night and thought it was really good. There was plenty of chicken and it was really tasty. The veggies were cooked perfectly and were delicious. My only critique is I wish there was more in the bowl. It seems like there wasn't as much food in this one as there are in other Healthy Choice meals. I would definitely buy this again though.

You never sometimes what it will taste like but the package looked promising. You just pop the whole bowl in the microwave and then when it's done mix it up. The sauce was delicious and the chicken and vegetables were fresh and yummy. Will definitely be making a trip to the store to buy more. It was a healthy and perfect lunch ð

I am a college student and trying to stay healthy and this looked great on the image but there was hardly any chicken and vegetables. The chicken has a weird after taste and the only thing that makes this edible is the sauce. Not going to be my first choice

This is one of my favorites great flavor low carbs too.

This was an excellent side dish but I was under the impression it was supposed to be a meal. There was little chicken, the small pieces didn't do anything to make it the least bit filling, I kept wishing I had made rice or riced cauliflower to serve it on.

--------------------
I am extremely disappointed with this meal. Most of the chicken had hard chewy pieces in it, the broccoli was mainly just the stems and the amount of food that was actually in the container was very little. I eat a lot of healthy choice meals and have been pretty disappointed lately, and after this meal I will most likely chose another brand of meals to purchase.
--------------------
Buy this regularly even though it is a little sweet for my taste.
--------------------
I found the sauce to be very watered down, my dinner had 3 tiny slivers of red pepper, a boatload of broccoli and carrots, a little onion, and some okay cooked chicken that of course looks nothing like the label. This one needs some quality control for sure!
--------------------
YEEEEEUMMMM! Excellent tastes and textures! This Chicken & Vegetable Stir Fry NEVER disappoints! SUPER-flavorful blend of light sauce, lean & tender chicken and healthy, fresh crispy-textured steamed vegetables. SCRUMPTILIUMCiOUS!!!!
--------------------
I love that it’s simple ingredients. Chicken and vegetables are well seasoned and deciding how much sauce you want is a nice feature. Will buy again.
--------------------
Better not be too hungry, box is deceiving. Too much sodium in so little amount of food to be healthy. Mostly broccoli in mine, hardly no chicken. Tastes good though, I have to admit
--------------------
I have enjoyed every Healthy Choice Steamer I have tried, but this one probably takes the cake! I was a little skeptical going in but the chicken tasted amazing, all the vegetables looked fresh and tasted great, and the sauce... the sauce was to die for! And the fact that everything comes up to less than 200 calories with 40% your daily amount of protein astounds me. I'll definitely be buying this again in the future!
--------------------
I love this dish! So delicious and fresh!
--------------------
I love this lean cuisine but I am having trouble finding in it Austin, Texas. Please let me know if it is no longer available.
--------------------
This is one of my favorite meals and I been searching ALL my local groceries and it’s no where to be found!! Please bring back in stock I would hate to move to another brand!!
--------------------
I bought this meal for my husband for work lunch. Well, he was very disappointed and turns out never had any lunch this day. He cooked it for 9 minutes, (crazy amount of time) and it came out awful. Rice was one hard lump and the Enchilada was shriveled up. Inedible. We were so surprised as every other email has been great! Will never buy this again!
--------------------
I've eaten this meal for the last several years and love it. Now I cannot find it at my local store or anywhere that delivers to us during this isolation time. Have you decided not to carry this particular meal because you have started Life Cuisine?
--------------------
I’ve been buying this frozen dinner for a really longer been eating just about every night now I can not find any where I’m so disappointed Are they going to ever be available again I’ve been trying to find them everywhere I guess might as well give up there just not available in new port richey fl
--------------------
Love the chicken enchalada but can’t find anymore very disappointed I can’t find this anymore
--------------------
This is my favorite lean cuisine OF ALL TIME. It is so good and there's nothing bad about it at all...... when you add a little bit of taco bell hot sauce in it ..... absolutely divine. the sour cream sauce is maybe my most favorite part. Unfortunately, it is so hard to find in the stores lately. always sold out and i will not venture out to try another one and it is honestly so disappointing. i would give this five stars but i cannot because of the fact that i cannot find it in the store. I'm sorry lean cuisine,,, please distribute more.
--------------------
Bought this and I was not disappointed. While I did have to adjust the cooking times as our work microwaves cook at full strength this was ok because my meal was done and boiling at less than the 9 minutes. I think it took about 5 1/2 minutes. Full of flavor and really good. I will buy this again.
--------------------
Great flavour and the sauce is so rich. I sometimes cook it for an extra 45 seconds as the edges of the sauce get crunchy.
--------------------
i would love the carb breakdown on the enchilada without the rice.
--------------------
I bought this and was super excited to try! While it tastes good, it didn’t come with the enchilada! :O all it had was the rice, sour cream sauce, and a bunch of rice in the sauce. I’m disappointed :(
--------------------
I bought these several years ago and didn't like them then. I tried them again and I still don't like them. They have no flavor. They are just spicy hot. The tortilla is mushy and sticky. Don't waste your money!
--------------------
Disgusting. Absolutely missable. Disappointed in the quality. Not sure how i feel about the rice. Tortilla was rock solid. The meat tasted like fruit, but rotten. Sauce was burnt hard.
--------------------
I haven't bought the Chicken Enchilada Suiza for many years. This particular meal has been around for quite some time because when I had it many years ago, it tasted great! So I decided to pick up a few of the dinners to put in our freezer. Lean Cuisine should consider going back to the original recipe. This new recipe is not good at all. The sauce is completely different and there is barely any chicken. Was extremely disappointing. I think I'll just make my own.
--------------------
It was my first time trying this entree and the rice was good, but the enchilada was disappointing. There was hardly any chicken in it, it was just tortilla with some tomato sauce and green peppers. Not even the flavor was very good.
--------------------
I bought this meal for the first time and was excited to try it. When I took it out of the microwave and took the plastic off there was no enchilada. Just sauce and rice, which tasted good, but disappointed there was no enchilada.
--------------------
The meal was just OK but I was expecting 2 enchiladas not 1 as I was used to finding in the package. Turns out I bought the wrong one - Smart Ones is the brand that nas 2 enchiladas in the package. My Bad!!
--------------------
I have had this meal over a dozen times and was shocked to take this out of the microwave, peel back the packaging and find NO ENCHILADA! I was so surprised I couldn't help but laugh. How absurd! I guess you really are "Lean" cuisine these days...
--------------------
The rice was dry and hard like brick and the enchilada was dry like chewing on leather.
--------------------
I get this one every once in a while and I enjoy it with some hot sauce , but it could use some improvements . First there should be 2 not one and second , not enough chicken in the enchilada . I like the sauce because I hate enchiladas with the red sauce . I have been getting this one for years , but it is more like a snack or I have to have something else with it to fill a little fuller .
--------------------
I have bought several meals & have loved all of them but this one. I have a 30 minute lunch, went to heat it up, to my surprise it said vent & heat for 9 MINUTES! Ok so I put it in & wasted my 9 minutes. The rice was all stuck together like a brick, there was nothing inside the enchilada & couldnt even cut it to try. Very very disappointed in this particular frozen meal.
--------------------
I have loved the Spicy Beef Enchilada for a while now. I was excited to try this version of the enchilada! It was a huge let down. The rice didn’t cook well and was dry, the sour cream sauce burnt around the edges of the tray and there wasn’t much of it to spread over the top. I’m not sure why they didn’t make it more similar to the spicy beef enchilada version. Wouldn’t recommend and won’t buy again!
--------------------
Hello, this is my favorite meal of all time. I would love one of these in Family Size! My rice was soft and and loaded with flavor. Please try to one, you won’t be disappointed. P.S. 50% power takes time but is worth the wait.
--------------------
There are very few frozen meals that I like, but this is usually one of my favorites! Except that the one I had today was missing the entire enchilada :( The rice and sauce were there but no enchilada.
--------------------
I was very excited about finding this meal. I could smell the awesome aroma. After the NINE minutes it says to cook it for(which is so strange to me 9 mins!!) the rice is a solid block!! Half of the enchilada is hard as a rock. I am sad bc now i am starving!!
--------------------
This was my first time trying any Lean Cuisine variety. I was pleasantly surprised. The enchilada tasted very good and the sauce helped made the rice tasty too.
--------------------
I brought this Lean Cuisine to work with the intention of having a quick, tasty meal. First, the meal takes 9 minutes to heat up. Once the 9 minutes passes you remove the film to find a burnt on the outside, mush on the inside enchilada. Forget trying to even cut it, its impossible. The "meal" was thrown out. An absolute waste of money.
--------------------
I bought this yesterday and decided to try it today. First of all, the instructions said to microwave it for 9 minutes on "50% heat," whatever that means. I'm glad I wasn't short on time. I cooked it for 9 minutes, which was clearly too long because it came out really dry. The rice was hard, some of it wasn't cooked. The enchilada just tasted gross. All I could really taste was the sauce and the tortilla. I opened it up to see what was inside... just little bits and pieces of shredded chicken here and there, and the occasional pepper. And some sauce. It was basically empty. 92% tortilla and maybe 8% filling. I threw most of it away. I was so mad I immediately got online to figure out where I could review it. I would recommend this to people I don't like.
--------------------
I’ve tried this dish several times and the filling inside the tortilla is very bland. The rice and cream sauce is great but the enchilada gets chewy in the microwave and again, the filling is not flavorful. Would love to see this recipe updated or more Mexican-inspired dishes to accompany the line.
--------------------
No flavor. No chicken. Will no buy again. It was not good.
--------------------
I have bought this for years! I love the sauce; and I admit it! Sometimes I eat 2! A little more sauce would bump it to 5 stars!
--------------------
This was undoubtedly the worst frozen dinner I have ever had in my life! Please take it off the market and rework it, this is a disgrace to frozen dinners!
--------------------
Lean Cuisine has totally reinvented this, and not for the better. Why would you mess with a very popular meal? I followed the cooking directions and it was almost inedible. It had next to no chicken and a very sour taste, and not from sour cream. It used to have two enchiladas and less rice so maybe it’s cheaper to produce? I’ll never buy it again. So disappointing.
--------------------
I have been buying Lean Cuisine products for many years now and have loved them. Based on the fact that I love the Santa Fe Beans and Rice, I decided to give the Chicken Enchilada Suiza a try. Big mistake. The enchilada was like shoe leather and could barely be cut with a serrated knife. The rice was bland and there wasn't enough sauce. I would never buy this meal again.
--------------------
I love Lean Cuisine and I am usually happy with my choices for lunch. Today was different. I chose Chicken Enchilada Suiza and when I opened the package there was rice and sauce but no Enchilada. I continued to cook it and opened the meal to search for the Enchilada but there really wasn't anything in the meal. The rice and sauce had a good flavor but I missed the Enchilada! :(
--------------------
I used to buy Lean Cuisines regularly years ago and this was one of my favorites. I am fairly certainly there used to be two enchiladas and not as much rice as this one did (although this DID look like the picture on the box). But there is virtually no chicken in the enchilada. I love the flavor, but there can't be very much protein in this, which means I will be starving in an hour! Disappointed!!
--------------------
Tortilla is hard and dry, rice mix has good flavor, As with most entrees needs more sauce and less sodium.
--------------------
I have been eating this product for years and was looking forward to dinner. I thought the cooking time was long, but followed directions. The microwave burned away most of the flavor. Disappointed and still hungry. Buy, but shorten the cooking time
--------------------
Loved this! I am shocked that something that only has 4 grams of fat can taste this good! Mine had plenty of delicious sauce, the portion of rice was perfect, and I love that it has pieces of corn in it! I too like many others was surprised when I saw a 9 minute cooking time. I did not know how to adjust the power setting on the microwave so I heated it for around 6 minutes only. Everything came out perfect except the ends of the enchilada were a little hard but I still ate them! Maybe next time I’ll do it for a little less time or find out how to adjust the power setting because this meal my friends is well worth the wait! This will most definitely be my go to Mexican fish from now on!
--------------------
I love lean cuisine. Eat it nearly most days. But to my dismay, this one told me to put it in the microwave for 9 minutes. When it was done, it was mostly tough, hard to chew, the sauce had fused with the container and just a very unpleasant experience. Maybe you need to change the recipe so it won’t need 9 minutes to become inedible. It was the 9 minutes a misprint?
--------------------
This is one of my favorite meals. It is very creamy and cheesy. I always mix the rice into the main portion of the dish. It does have a little spice, so I add sour cream. It is also very filling.
--------------------
I bought this from Walmart as I love these kind of quick meals for lunch on a busy work day, but this was such a disappointment. Cooking it for 9 minutes sounding insane so I stopped at 6 and still the rice was funky and the enchilada dry. Not happy!
--------------------
I don't know what everyone is complaining about. I order Enchilada Suizas from various local Mexican Restaurants (the sauce is supposed to be a creamy green color) so when I saw that Lean Cuisine had this I grabbed it out of the freezer case so fast! Sure the long heating time is unusual for a TV dinner but it came out perfectly! I prefer to vary my heating power on microwaves anyway so that I don't end up with over cooked foods so I'm a pro at modifying the power setting. I was impressed to see that a TV dinner had picked up on the fact that your rice and your meal will actually hold in its moisture better when heated at a lower power. This is my new favorite frozen lunch choice!
--------------------
I buy this monthly. Hubby likes this dinner, also.
--------------------
I have been enjoying LC's Enchilada Suiza for a decade. This is my favorite frozen meal, always consistent, the sour cream sauce is rich and delicious, the chicken is finely minced and easy to eat. I love this meal. I haven't seen it in stores recently, I hope it is not going anywhere, I would be so sad without it!
--------------------
This was an absolutely poor meal...the enchilada was almost more like a tamale...the rice was the best feature...but it was tasteless. Not sure what you were going for with that sauce? ARGH ~ Not a big fan of frozen meals....and this is why. Way too many calories and sodium for what it was trying to be.
--------------------
Enchilada tastes amazing!! Rice goes well with it! Really hits the spot! Great job Lean Cuisine
--------------------
i literally unrolled it with my fork after taking a couple bites of straight tortilla. there was a piece of chicken at the other end so i took that bite & left the soggy tortilla in the tray. i didn't even try to get into the second one yet :/
--------------------
This is my absolute favorite lean cuisine meal to get! The sauce is so cream and smooth. And the rice and enchilada have a little hit/kick of spice!
--------------------
Unlike others, I LOVED this product. Yes, I was initially shocked to see a 9 min time, but thankfully I don't need to fight for the microwave in the break room. This dish came out so perfect and tender when I pulled the film. It was the perfect amount of sauce to my enchilada. I will forever be buying this product again. Note to others, make sure you read the labels before heating.
--------------------
I followed the instructions to a t. 9 minutes at 50% power. I even stopped it 30 seconds earlier, and my food was hard as a rock. I had a 12 hour shift to work and had to go the whole time without food because I followed the instructions on how to heat this LC. If you buy this LC, dont follow the cooking instructions. I dont even have a powerful microwave.
--------------------
I bought this meal on sale at Publix about a month ago with 3 other of yours, when I fixed this meal and ate it , I was disappointed. This was the worst tasting frozen meal I have ever eaten. Smart Ones is great in comparision.
--------------------
I have a 1200-watt microwave oven and find the 9 minutes at 50% power cooking to be TOO LONG! Everything is dried up and hard at this time/power. However, if I cook it for 7 minutes at 50% power it is perfect! A very tasty product.
--------------------
I loveeeee this LC. I normally don't do online reviews but this one had to have one. This is the best frozen meal I've eaten so far. I love mexican food and when I can't have it everyday I will settle for this. I added a little butter to my rice because it came out a little dry but very tasty. My favorite part was the enchilada sauce. It's so savory and creamy. I know a lot of people are complaining of the 9 minutes it took to cook but you have to watch it because it does say to adjust to 50% of the wattage on the microwave. If you don't adjust the wattage check it every so often after 7 minutes. I will be buying a lot more of these!!
--------------------
This is a delicious entree and a favorite. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is it's easy to overcook. I have a 700 watt microwave and instructions are usually for 1000 to 1100 watts so it's a guessing game. Overcooked, the tortilla turns to leather so half of it is inedible. And I would love it if there were 2 instead of one. More, please?
--------------------
This used to be one of my favorites - new packaging separating the rice and enchilada and neither side had ANY sauce. Will NOT buy again. Highly disappointing lunch
--------------------
The "chicken" enchilada didn't have a single bite of chicken to it. The rice mix and sauce were tasty, but it was lacking one critical component and that was the protein.
--------------------
I just finished eating my rice and tortilla. I wish there was actually chicken in the “chicken” enchilada :( there’s no way that means is that much protein and so few calories :( :( :(
--------------------
I was worried about cooking it for 9 minutes/50% power but it turned out perfect. Rice had a decent cilantro flavor but not much else. I mixed it with the enchilada and sauce and that helped a lot. Very few corn kernels, so might as well leave it out as it's not needed. The sour cream sauce had really nice flavor, but some green chili sauce or jalapenos would make it even better! Definitely will buy again!!
--------------------
I can't believe these negative reviews. This is my favorite frozen meal of any brand. I pour Cholula all over it and enjoy.
--------------------
I've been eating this dish regularly as a part of the weight watchers program. I always add light sour cream and my favorite chunky salsa from my local restaurant that is 0 points. I always heat in the oven as I think it comes out better. This past week I got some new ones and almost melted a whole mess of plastic in my oven. (used to have oven directions on the back).. I'm hoping lean cuisine doesn't retire the oven safe version! Overall an awesome product for someone on a diet.
--------------------
The cooking directions were different than most meals but I changed my microwave power and everything turned out perfectly cooked. I had to add some salt to my rice, but it was not bad. The enchilada had some good flavors but the sauce is the star of the meal if you ask me. There was plenty of it for the enchilada as well as the rice if you wanted to spice up the rice that needed just a little more something. The 3 stars were attributed to the rice and the longer cooking time but I would gladly give it a try again.
--------------------
I am so sorry to see all of these negative comments on the Chicken Enchilada Suiza. This is one of my favorites from Lean Cuisine! Cooking at 9 min on 50% power has turned this meal out perfectly for me every.singe.time. I mix the rice, sauce, and enchilada all together once heated and I just love it! A few minutes ago I pulled the dish from the box and to my surprise, the sauce was uncharacteristically GREEN! This is what brought me to their website. I found a review that was answered saying that the chopped jalapenos can occasionally turn the sauce green. Hmmmm... I suppose I'll buy into that. So while I typed this review, my enchilada was in the microwave. I just took it out and again... very surprised... the green color had almost completely vanished (anyone who has ever "flash frozen" vegetables knows that this method of food preservation holds the bright color (cooked veggies have a dull color). Before hitting "post review" I took a few bites to be sure it tasted the same. It is WONDERUL! I think it has a tad more bite to it which makes me believe the jalapeno explanation 100%. This dish will always be at the top of my list. Thank you Lean Cuisine!
--------------------
I set my microwave for 9 minutes at 50% power and it was really good!
--------------------
bought two of these even based on the awful reviews. the first one I made as directed and turned our burnt to a crisp like most others state. the second time I microwaved on regular power for 4 minutes and it came out fine although I wouldn't really call this an enchilada, it's more a like a rolled tortilla in sauce with no filling.
--------------------
i purchase this for lunch and it was awful who cookand frozen entree for 9 minutes terrible instruction my whole lunch period were ruin.never purchase this again
--------------------
I'm not able to give a review for taste because I didn't get that far. I got this particular meal to make for lunch in my office microwave. I followed the instructions to cook for 9 minutes at 50% power. I walked in a few minutes later to a smokey kitchen and all of the windows were completely fogged up!! I immediately stopped the microwave and took the meal out. It was completely charred. The rice came out in one hard clump and the enchilada and sauce were one hard black lump also. There was still about 1 1/2 minutes left. I am afraid to think what would've happened if I didn't go check on it before the microwave was done. My coworkers and I eat Lean Cuisine meals all the time for lunch, we always have a variety in our freezer. This one will not be purchased anymore!
--------------------
I buy these often love the flavor just enough for a meal. Low fat low calories great meal. I consume 1 lean cuisine meal a day. Great for weight loss and maintenance.
--------------------
Cooking instructions a bit different from other meals. Smelled so good, tasted great.
--------------------
I was surprised at the 9 minute cook time but followed the directions accordingly - including the 50% power level. When it got done I was awarded with a crispy brick of an echilada my fork could not penetrate and a block of hardened rice. Judging by the other reviewers this is not the first time this has happened. Extremely disappointed in this product.
--------------------
I too am writing to complain about the awful cooking directions. I followed the instructions of 50% power and 9 minutes. Sadly, my meal was burnt and inedible. I was so looking forward to my lunch. I was left with just disappointment (and a missed meal). Please correct the instructions before more people have to throw out this dish and skip lunch.
--------------------
I eat Lean Cuisine everyday for lunch & even sometimes for dinner. I like Mexican food, so I decided to try this one out. I was disappointed. Hardly any chicken in the enchilada and it was burnt around the edges after cooking for the recommended time. The rice was hard, but other than being hard it was delicious. Never been so upset with an entree from LC.
--------------------
I usually love the Chicken Enchilada Suiza. Always follow the heating instructions with no issues. This time, The enchilada was a hard as a rock and the rice was horrible too. I had to dump the whole meal. Don't know what happened since I only bought it (along with 10 or so others) last week.
--------------------
It's really not bad for what it is especially if you douse it in hot sauce.
--------------------
I think the bad reviews are due to not following cooking instructions. Personally, I had time and used it to skip cooking dinner so I cooked mine in the oven. I think it's one of the superior lean cuisines. The sauce is delicious. Definitely give it a shot.
--------------------
I should not have to take my lunch break to figure out why it should take 9 minutes to heat up a quick and easy lean cuisine. I buy these meals all the time and have never needed to look for 50% power before, well until my meal turned to stone. :(
--------------------
After reading the negative reviews I was compelled to put in my 2 cents. This is actually one of my go to meals. I know that the 50% power cooking time is longer than usual, so I don't take this particular LC to work. The amount of food is filling and satisfying.
--------------------
I bought this because I wanted to try something new from lean cuisine. The panini is my go to,however I went ahead and purchased two enchilada dinners. I have no idea why I decided try it even though I was not expecting much. I followed all direction and the enchilada came out hard and not edible. There were around strands of chicken and the weakest enchilada sauce ever. Rice was clumpy and soggy. Defiantly won't be eating the second dinner I bought.
--------------------
This was my time trying Lean Cuisine as I usually get the Smart ones but decided to give it a try, I absolutely loved it! The green sour cream sauce is great! I'm really shocked at all the negative comments from people not being able to comprehend/follow instructions...come on guys, how many times have you ever had to put a microwavable meal in for 9 minutes? That should have been a big red flag prompting you to read the directions more carefully.
--------------------
Don't be ridiculous and cook this at full power for 9 min. Either turn it to 50% or cook for less time. Yeah there's not tons of chicken but I don't like a lot of meat. I do wish I knew how many calories the rice is because I don't eat it all. Overall, it's tasty and is satisfying.
--------------------
There was something wrong with my product -- the part of the container that I assume was meant for the rice was completely empty! I still heated it up (keep in mind that the recommended microwave time is 9 minute or 35 in the oven) and was pleasantly surprised to find the dish to be extremely delicious. The sauce was spectacular and if my meal was complete I can't image rating it anything under 5 stars.
--------------------
There are several lean cuisine meals that I really like, but this one went straight to the trash can. Nasty.
--------------------
This actually turned out pretty good, the sauce on the enchilada was delicious and the rice was good as well. I looked on the instructions and saw to cook for 9 minutes, I thought that sounded crazy and I never follow directions anyways so I only did 6 minutes and everything was fully cooked and fine, any longer would've been over cooked. Definitely buying this again.
--------------------
It's tasty as long as you follow instructions and cook on 50% power. One of my faves
--------------------
I just had this for dinner tonight and it was awful. I don't really know what to say about this. I will not be buying this one again!
--------------------
I picked this for my lunch today and was eager to try it, i cooked mine at 5 min and followed a previous review, i think it could have gone less. I think this is filling and great way to eat carbs and not over doing it, I think the enchilada and rice was good but the sauce was off putting, it was very sweet and was looking for something more salty. I did purchase more meals and look forward to trying them out.
--------------------
Rarely ever, does the rice have more flavor than the "main dish". The mexican rice was very tasty but the enchilada lacked the chicken filling and the sauce had very little taste. I found myself wishing I had more of the rice, instead of the enchilada. I am new to this Lean Cuisine diet but everything else that I have tried so far has been so tasty and I was surprised to feel so satisfied when I was done with my mini meal. This meal however, I will not be purchasing again.
--------------------
Bought it once a few months ago and ran into the issue of it getting hard as soon as I took it out. Bought it a second time thinking I just messed up some how and no. Followed every instruction (not that there's many) and it still comes out hard as a rock. Very disappointed. Definitely will be buying lean cuisine less then I already do.
--------------------
I followed the directions and my micro is under the tested wattage. I cooked it for the recommended time in my 900 watt microwave oven. It was so overcooked it was uneatable. The enchilada was hard as a rock. I ate the sauce with a side of mixed veggies. Guess I saved some calories this dinner for sure. :(
--------------------
I read the instructions and set my microwave accordingly and it turned out perfect for me. The rice was light and fluffy and was actually quite tasty. For me there was a lot of rice and I didn't finish it all. The enchilada was ok but not sure I will purchase it again.
--------------------
I noticed that many people are having issues with the microwave cooking instructions(50% for 9 minutes). If you are having issues about cooking this entree, here's my suggestion(make sure you have a food thermometer): cut the film to vent, then cook on high for 3 minutes. Check the food temperature using your food thermometer and if it does not reach 160 F, continue heating for 20-30 seconds and check the temperature again. Repeat until it reaches 160 F. For me, this came out hot and delicious after 4 minutes on high(my microwave is 1000 Watts). Now here's what I liked about this dish: the sour cream is delicious, enchilada is tasty and had plenty of chicken, and the rice is very tasty(I like putting some of the sour cream on the rice). Overall, this is a great lunch and hopefully after reading this review, you won't have issues cooking this.
--------------------
I had high hopes for this, but they fell short. It has potential, but honestly, there is pretty much no chicken in there. I felt like I was eating a folded tortilla with sauce on top and rice. The flavor is not horrible, and with some tweaking, I think it could actually be good.
--------------------
Tried to eat this today but couldn't eat the tortilla with barely anything inside and the sauce was even worse because of a soapy nasty flavor. I didn't even want to give this to my dog to eat! Lean Cuisine should really consider eliminating this item from their menu selection because some people; like me; might believe that there are more dinners that will taste too horrible to eat and they will have wasted their money!
--------------------
I'm sure it would be good. But I just like so many others read 9 minutes, thought it to be strange, still put it in the microwave and had a solid block of rice and inedible lunch. Maybe next time I'll be able to try it :-(
--------------------
I just tried this for my lunch and cooked it at full percentage for 3 minutes, then 50% for 3 minutes and it came out perfect. Sauce and rice were a little bland but I had a decent amount of chicken in the enchilada and a good amount of corn in the rice. I would recommend this meal, just check it a couple times and adjust it to your microwave! Great low calorie and quick option!
--------------------
My Enchilada and rice was burnt and so hard I could not cut it with a knife. I read the package 3 times to check to time. 9 minute it too long! I don't know how to change the watts???? Never had to before. My lunch was ruined.
--------------------
Followed cook time directions and power setting and ended up with a burnt meal and food hard and dry as a bone. No lunch for me today--very disappointing. I just read a bunch of comments similar to mine--why hasn't the cook time been revised?
--------------------
I've been eating this meal for years, so I was quite surprised when I heated it up today and found no enchilada -- that section of the tray just had the sour cream sauce. The rice was there, so I just ended up eating that with some of the sauce mixed in. Guess it got missed in the factory.
--------------------
I've loved this Lean Cuisine dish for years now. Great flavor!!
--------------------
Been very satisfied with various LC dishes.This was the first that I found very poor quality. Almost no chicken and the sauce was fairly tasteless. Will not buy this one again unless they change some things. Also recommend that the 50% power label be altered on the box to see easier.
--------------------
Love this one! My son who loves beef and broccoli when we go out for Chinese also loves this quick, easy meal.
--------------------
The broccoli in this is really tasty along with the rice. But the beef just isnt that good to me.
--------------------
I really enjoy this for my lunch . It easy and tasteful and just something to hold you for few hrs . The price isnt bad usually have a sale
--------------------
I do not eat meat but purchased this for my mother-in-law. She is very picky and ate all of this. Yay, great job in helping satisfy the picky eater. It is a healthy quick meal as well. Grab one today and you will not be disappointed.
--------------------
Actually had a taste for some chinese but didnt want to drive to a restaurant to get some lol. So I substituted this instead and actually taste good. I popped it in the oven and once it was done took it out and added some duck sauce and it was awesome
--------------------
A great fresh taste, not like frozen but with the convenience of frozen. I don't like to cook and this is a way to eat something healthy, with lean protein and great cancer-preventing broccoli.
--------------------
To be a frozen food, it's a really good option, since it's low in calories and contains protein and vegetables. Also, it has a tasty sauce to pour the food and makes a really good combination. I take this bowls to the office and they help me to make a better choice when eating and not ordering delivery! It's not so fresh, but again, is frozen food, but a very good option !!
--------------------
My microwave is 800 watts and even if I cook it a little longer than the package suggests, the rice is never done. I mix it together and then have to microwave 45 (or more) seconds longer. Any suggestions?
--------------------
Reminds me of take out, without all the other, delicious and fatten effects it has on me. Not terrible a frozen alternative.
--------------------
Just add soy sauce and this meal is great. Fast and simple to make, no complications. Affordable, light, and healthy
--------------------
One way to get kids to eat healthy and they have/love the broccoli,which now they like it. We enjoy it.it makes dinner more enjoyable.
--------------------
Beef was chewy and the portion size was small. Didnt taste the best but at least I wasnt hungry after eating it.
--------------------
This product was pretty good. I added soy sauce for additional flabor. It was affordable but not very filling.
--------------------
Very good and very healthy! Not to heavy so is great for lunch. The only think I would change is to add more veggies!
--------------------
This is my favorite one. They taste so fresh like you just cooked it. I will bring a little sea salt and cracked pepper to add on top but other than that they get an A+
--------------------
Prefer over locally delivered chinese food. The brown sauce used in this is very tasty. I eat this once a month. Id prefer less stalks and more broccoli florets but thats just personal pref. Super easy to prepare and all recyclable.
--------------------
It tasted fine. I tasted like a frozen meal. It was neither awful nor notably delicious. It was just, 'fine." It was handy to have on hand for days/nights when there was no time or energy to cook a full meal from scratch for the family. Such is the case with almost all frozen meals.
--------------------
I love this beef and broccoli! I throw mine in the microwave for 5 minutes and it comes out steaming hot. I have recommended these for a few years now.
--------------------
So yummy! One of my favorite frozen entrees. I recommend trying it out, you wont regret it. :)
--------------------
I really enjoy the healthy choice beef and broccoli entree. The taste is really good and does not taste artificial at all. It is easy to warm up, you just put it in the microwave and heat it. It's one of the healthier options available.
--------------------
Delicious delicious delicious this product is fast, easy, and nutritious for a frozen meal it is affordable and uses the healthier choice in ingredients so you do not have to feel bad about eating it afterwards I love this brand
--------------------
I really enjoyed how the flavors of all the food included mixed! It's also pretty healthy compared to most other frozen products you can get. It's also a pretty big meal for my size, so I can save and reheat all the bits I don't eat. I can also share the meal with my family.
--------------------
Its ok for a quick solution at work not my favorite but it works and isnt horrible on calories
--------------------
Didnt think these would be a favorite in my house. Boy was I mistaken! These are so good, delicious and easy to make, the fact that you can be guilt is a plus!
--------------------
The beef is so tender! I will continue to get this one. Please don’t discontinue
--------------------
I enjoyed this a lot. The broccoli and beef were very tender and good. I liked the combination of beef, vegetables and rice. It has healthy ingredients which are great for helping me with weight loss. It was easy to make and it tasted good. I definitely recommend this to others!
--------------------
Very yummy and didnt taste frozen at all. Has good Asian flavors and low calories for those on a stricter diet or watching calories
--------------------
This stuff is tasty for what it is. It's a microwavable TV dinner that's made to be healthier. So, not the greatest in my opinion. But that being said, I've eaten this more than once so it's not terrible. It fills my belly for a few hours and it's pretty cheap
--------------------
So delicious! Easy to make! Super affordable ! Great option if you don't wanna spend the money on fast food but youre too tired to cook! Good serving size, easy instructions, great quality! I would definitely suggest this.
--------------------
Healthy Choice Beef & Broccoli is good. I get this one when my top two healthy choice meals are sold out. I like the sauce to food ratio. Its filling for a quick dinner when I dont feel like cooking.
--------------------
Super easy to make, and the meat has a uniform texture, which I like. No weird chewy or hard parts. The broccoli steams well too and doesnt get soggy.
--------------------
Its tasty. Its convenient. The price is right. These are a great go to when life gets hectic and you dint want to cook or DoorDash something unhealthy
--------------------
One of my favorites it tastes savory. The beef to broccoli ratio is pretty much on point. Its just all around good and tasty.
--------------------
Healthy choices beef and broccoli mixture provides a healthy meal that tastes pleasurable. I eat a frozen meal weekly from healthy choice because it is quick, easy, and relatively healthy. I am always satisfied with the overall quality of the product!
--------------------
It has good taste. Super fast for a quick lunch meal. And it's healthy at the same time. I love buying these.
--------------------
Its like Chinese food without the guilt. Tastes good and not as salty. And the size is healthier so if fixes the craving without overdoing it. Heats quick and easy.
--------------------
I mean, its beef and broccoli. Honestly, its pretty standard compared to other frozen beef and broccolis. But I normally get healthy choice because its a decent portion size.
--------------------
The Healthy Choice line is BY FAR my favorite line of frozen meals out there. You can eat healthy without compromising on taste! The consistency of the sauce pairs amazingly well with the beef and broccoli. This is one of my top 3 favorites!
--------------------
I cover the whole thing in cayenne pepper and it’s soooo good
--------------------
I normally like these meals. About the last 4 months the rice is hard after cooking. I have tried several microwaves and still the same. Not fully cooked rice!
--------------------
Tried this 2 days ago and it was delicious. Didn’t have that freezer taste that some meals have. Will buy again definitely
--------------------
The beef and broccoli simply steamers is amazing! This is made with 100% natural beef and only 270 calories this is a great choice. Will be buying again!
--------------------
I used to love healthy choice, simply made beef and broccoli, but lately there has been items in the food that are not food. There are hard pieces like plastic grounded in the food. I am not just saying one or two. There has been about 15 times this has happened.
--------------------
I love this and my kids do too. It's great to have something quick for busy nights. Tastes great we add a little Kikomann soy sauce. Yum!
--------------------
My wife and I are on an "intermittent fasting" diet and often on those days we will have prepared meals like these. I just finished my beef and broccoli and commented to her "Id buy this in a restaurant." It really was delicious. Obviously I'd want a bigger portion if I'm eating out, but today is a diet day.
--------------------
Today was my first time trying Healthy Choice, and this was what I picked, and I love it! Iâm currently trying to lose weight and hopefully this will help! The balance of rice, broccoli, beef, and sauce is perfect in my opinion.
--------------------
I really enjoy this! It's been a while since I've had it, and if you're watching your calories (or on WW) this is a good start, or a good way to continue. When you first stir everything together, it doesn't look like it'll be enough sauce, but there definitely is. It's 270 calories and I believe 8 WW Smart Points. It's not overly salty like some microwave food is. And it has 16 grams of protein. I recommend, and will repurchase.
--------------------
Cafe Steamer's have been a great way for me to lose weight. I love enjoying the different options they have for my lunches. They're quick, easy, and delicious. This one in particular is one of my favorites. The only issue I might have is I wish it had less sauce and more broccoli in it. Otherwise, I definitely recommend!
--------------------
This is a quick, healthy choice that is convenient and also delicious.
--------------------
It is a great thing that I decided not to read the reviews and try it for myself. This is definitely a home run.
--------------------
First tried this about 2-3 months ago and found it delicious, just as advertised. Meat and rice tasty. Didn't purchase more of this steamer selection again until a few weeks ago. However, this time I did not find this steamer 'delicious'. While the veggies were fine, the meat was tough and the rice hard (like little pellets). Thinking the rice may not have cooked long enough (either by Healthy Choice or myself) I tried another (new) Steamer. Results were the same. With regard to Healthy Choice's 'brown rice', let me say that I am familiar with white rice and brown rice (which I prefer) I would not call Healthy Choice's rice ingredient as 'brown rice', as it's a 'white rice'. In summary, I would not recommend this steamer to anyone without some clarification.
--------------------
I just purchased this Beef Broccoli steamer from Dâagostinos on the Upper East Side. I work in the neighborhood and I wanted some quick and healthy for lunch. Now this is not a review about the flavor, this meal is delicious when you finally get it to be edible. First I cooked it on high for the suggested 4:30 seconds, but when I tasted it, the rice was hard and crunchy. Then I microwaved it for an additional 2 minutes with a piece of cling wrap over it, but there wasnât much change. I pulled out a frying pan added about 1/2 Cup of water, and cooked the meal until the water evaporated. Only then was the rice soft enough for consumption. I donât know if I got a bad batch or something, but this was more of a hassle than a convenience. Again it is delicious (Iâm currently eating this meal as I write this review) but it took about 15 minute to prepare.
--------------------
The beef was tender, broccoli was a bit too crunchy, andnruce was cooked, but it had absolutely no flavor. Very watery type taste, maybe more sauce or just more seasoning? They cant please everyone though, if it had more flavor someone would complain it was over powering I'm sure!
--------------------
Healthy Choice steamers are one of my fave things to grab for a quick meal while at work. They’re not too spendy and they’re full of flavor. I usually hate frozen meals, but these are definitely the best.
--------------------
Sauce was tasty, but mostly rice; very tiny amount of broccoli and beef was on the tough side. I like other HC steamers but won't buy this one again and wouldn't recommend.
--------------------
This meal was surprisingly delicious. I just started back eating healthy again and this was my first frozen meal and I enjoyed the flavor and simplicity of it. Although the sauce was a bit runny (but still full of flavor) the chicken, rice and broccoli were perfect. Thanks Healthy choice.
 Don't take this one away but if you want to drop the price that would be alright.
--------------------
I have purchased Healthy Choice and never had a tasteless product, but this time my beef & broccoli was not even edible!
--------------------
Disappointing in this bowl. The taste is whatever but I shouldn't have to almost break my tooth to a bone that shouldn't be there. Had to throw away the whole bowl.
--------------------
I dont normall purchase frozen entrees but when I do I buy these!! They are so good and easy to make. Just pop in the microwave and it steams your food. These have a great flavor and taste pretty darn good! These are perfect for on the go. They have several great flavors and do not taste like overly processed food. I woudont have them everyday but occasionally yes, they are good for lunch.
--------------------
If you are in hurry, don’t wanna cook or don’t have time for it, healthy choice is a great option. They’re healthy, delicious and easy preparation
--------------------
It just had a weird taste for my liking. The rice didn’t seem like it cooked all the way.
--------------------
I have been buying multiple boxes of this for about a year now. Last week, for the first time, the rice was not cooked. Crunchy. It made the meal not edible. I have contacted customer service as if it keeps happening I will no longer purchase. If contacted back from customer service and I'm offered coupons for free box(es) - 3 have been bad. I would purchase again. If the issue is not resolved and keeps occurring, I will no longer purchase or recommend HC products.
--------------------
Label states 100% Beef, but being totally allergic to chicken, this meal gave me problem for two days... You already have like 7 chicken Simply Steamers and 15 Cafe Steamers. I have always liked your quality ingredients, but now can't trust , "Natural Flavors" and getting sick??? Also... I know your products have so much less salt than most on the market but hope you will continue to keep that salt level down.
--------------------
best tv dinner ive ever had
--------------------
This is hands down one of my favorite frozen meals. It tasted really good and the perfect amount of everything. This is a lunch time staple for me now. Quick and easy and so yummy.
--------------------
Super yummy for a “health food” version of beef and broccoli. These meals make eating quick an easy when you’re a busy mom.
--------------------
This use to be my favorite meal. I would eat this flavor multiple times a week at work. I ate one about a month ago and although the broccoli and beef were still good, the rice was hard...like it wasn't cooked all the way through. I threw it out, it was like eating pebbles. So I gave it another try today. Still, meat and broccoli good, but rice is not. It's still hard in places and I even cooked it 5 mins. If something changed...please change it back. I miss this meal!!
--------------------
This meal tasted wonderful flavor wise and I loved the amount of beef in the meal, however the rice was awful. It was so hard and dry that I couldn't eat it to start with, I added water and allowed it to soak but it was still an unpleasant texture and made the meal unworthy of purchasing again.
--------------------
Overall this meal is fantastic. My only complaint is focused on the rice. It's crunchy, I'm not sure what they could do to fix it but they should definitely look into it.
--------------------
The dinner is tasty except for the rice. It is so undercooked that it is crunchy and tastes raw.
--------------------
The sauce is delicious-savory and slightly sweet, without being over spiced. Just enough sauce to coat everything evenly without being soggy or soup. The beef is tender and juicy, the perfect amount so you feel satisfied. The broccoli florets are fresh and crisp-tender but need to be doubled in amount--I love broccoli. The rice is the worst part, while I love that they used brown rice instead of white and it was the perfect amount of rice, a good portion of it tends to be undercooked and slightly crunchy. Yes I would buy again and yes I would recommend to a friend but with caveats that it's one of their lower end meals because of the rice. Although a low end Healthy Choice is far better than alot of high end tv dinners in general.
--------------------
This is absolutely delicious. I love hot it is strictly beef, broccoli and rice.. not a bunch of filler veggies. Tastes like a local take out and it was delicious

The beef with broccoli isn't bad in terms of quantity but the flavor is a bit lacking.

I really enjoyed this dish, partly because it has no extra add-ons like so many other Healthy Choice steamer bowls have. Tender grilled chicken, broccoli florets, and brown rice with just enough sauce to coat everything. There was literally nothing left in the bowl when I was finished. A very satisfying meal, and worthy of the word 'simply.'

If I could give no stars or negative I would! I'm a huge beef and broccoli eater I could eat it 6 times a week. So I figured why not try this! The biggest waste of my money! It tastes awful! The meat is tough and the broccoli is mushy! Worst frozen meal I've ever ate!

This fresh bowl was awesome. The flavors were perfect! The amount of sauce was perfect! Beef was good too (worried it would be chewy, but wasn't at all). This is a great bowl. I would definitely recommend and purchase again!

--------------------
this is literally the best healthy frozen meal!!! It tastes so fresh and I'm addicted to it now because it's yummy and so much easier than having to cook a healthy meal. I just wish I could learn how to make the sauce because it's the best and the beef is very tender which surprised me

--------------------
This was awesome!! The beef tasted really good and the broccoli wasn't hard. I also loved how you could choose how much sauce you wanted. Great dinner!
--------------------
So so Amazing, the first time I tried Healthy choice I was so surprised at how delicious and healthy these are!
--------------------
Had a wonderful taste and was very filling!
--------------------
Omg this is so delicious! The serving is perfect for my lunch break. Instructions are easy enough and the taste is amazing.
--------------------
Great taste you do not even need the sauce! I would recommend. The taste needs nothing added to it. It is healthy and has a satisfying after taste.
--------------------
Tasted good but there was way to much sauce and not enough broccoli.
--------------------
The meat was delicious, as was the whole meal. And I felt satisfied after I was done, so portion size was perfect. Yum!
--------------------
Healthy Choice used to be downright gross to even try to eat. The flavors were fake and too much fake sugar. I gave this a try today due to being tired but also having gestational dianetes. The carb count is super reasonable considering it has rice. And the taste is pleasant. [product:healthy-choice-cafe-steamers-simply-beef-broccoli-10-oz-box] is a GREAT choice for keeping healthy on the go!
--------------------
This is by far the best tasting Healthy Choice Steamer. I have my entire office addicted!
--------------------
I actually really enjoyed this and I am extremely picky about microwaved meat and veggies. The steamer tray keeps your rice and veggies from turning to mush when they cook. The sauce was a little sweet, but I was pleased with the level of salt. Not too salty like most microwaved meals. The meat was better than expected for microwaved beef. Chewy, but not tough, and thankfully not mushy. An easy way to get some protein, veggies, and healthy grains on the run. Yum!
--------------------
Really like this dinner my only problem is is that none of the stores around here have it anymore. :(
--------------------
Literally tasted better than take out
--------------------
The picture on box is no where near what is inside. The few peices of beef were harder to chew than beef jerky and awful. Few pieces of brocolli and mostly rice. I definitely won't eat this again or recommend it.
--------------------
I enjoyed my meal. Meat was tender and the broccoli had a nice bite to it. The sauce ran a bit on the sweet side but most Asian foods have that element. I did like the subtle heat behind it tho which did help
--------------------
1200 calories stretched out over a day can leave me in anticipation of dinner. This steak and broccoli bowl was like eating sugar, sauce was overly sweet and the steak was too rubbery. The only saving grace for my dinner was the mushy broccoli. Thanks healthy choice for the sweet rubbery mess that was my dinner!!!
--------------------
The mango chicken tastes good for a frozen meal. I like the ease of grab n go to work without much thought. It also helps with portion control. The price isn't bad either. I do recommend to try one of them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love that this meal is quick and easy!! The taste is delicious too. My kids love Chinese so this bowl was right up their alley. Will be purchasing again. We also loved that even my 8 & 9 year old kiddos could make this in the microwave!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Mango Chicken with Coconut Rice Bowl is a go-to for lunch and it doesn't leave you feeling like you have not eaten. The coconut rice and mango goes well with the chicken without overpowering the other flavor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Well I love the flavors. First off it could use more chicken. The rice was good. The mango flavoring was good. I really didn’t have much issue last minus the lack of chicken. I expected more. But it is with it for someone dieting [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This meal is tasty and tastes very tropical. My only thing is I am personally not a huge fan of the coconut rice. It didn’t ruin the dish for me. It just is not my favorite thing I have ever had. I would be willing to eat it again though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is my new favorite work lunch ! So flavorful and fresh tasting ! The mango and coconut flavor tasted extremely fresh for a frozen meal ! Also love that it is calorie conscious and keeps me feeling full for hours ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I bought this a month ago and I am so glad I did...It was so delicious and I can't wait to try other ones.it was a simple meal.i will definitely be recommending it to all my friends and family to try your products.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This was honestly my first time trying coconut rice. It is phenomenal. To be honest it tasted perfect with the mango chicken and the two couldn’t of been paired better. Coconut rice is one of those things u have to try first!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
i love the mango flavor that this adds! i am a nurse so it’s always helpful to have a quick and easy healthy lunch that i can eat in a short period of times these are also super healthy and very inexpensive! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this last week because I love mangoes. It was amazing! The coconut rice complimented the mango chicken so well. I will be getting this again. This was a smart healthy choice for me. Very please. I do wish the portion size was bigger but I think it was just so delicious that I didn't want to stop eating it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Wow!! Who knew Lean Cuisine could make such yummy healthier meals? I mean it's like a Chinese dish. What's not to love? Every bite is mouth watering. The sauce is the perfect blend of savory. I went and stocked up my freezer! These are incredible and so so good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The mango chicken rice is my favorite Lean Cuisine. It’s so flavorful and tasty. I love having a quick, healthy and convenient lunch option. They are very satisfying and leave me full. The perfect amount of food. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This bowl had a great tropical flavor. The mango flavor was very prominent in the bowl. the hunks of chicken were the perfect bite size and weren't lacking. The coconut rice had a good flavor as well. The flavors all worked together well in this bowl. The only complaint I have is that it was a bit watery but if you let it set for a few minutes after cooking the moisture got absorbed by the rice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
For a frozen meal, this was ok. I didn't really get the taste of mango, more if just a citrus bite to it. I thought the coconut rice was almost to sweet. I honestly don't think I would purchase this again, maybe I would consider trying another meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I bought this Mango chicken coconut rice bowl 3 weeks ago and cooked it and tried it and it tasted real great . It is real easy to cook in the microwave. It comes with just the right amount of servings. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
There is just the right amount of sweetness and a hint of spice in this mango chicken coconut bowl! I am pleasantly surprised at the amount of chicken in this bowl. The edamame were tender. I will definitely purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I enjoy a good Lean Cuisine every now and then. They make great lunches for work and while I am traveling. I was excited to try this one with the promise that it might be just a bit more filling. Overall, it was decent. But I would have liked a bit more chicken, a bit less rice, a bit more mango, a bit less sticky sweet. Spicy is good, but I usually pick around too many peppers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Liked this flavor and would buy it again! Handy to have in the freezer for a quick, convenient meal on the go that is much healthier than fast food. Would have liked for it to have had a little more chicken in it, but that's par for the course for microwave meals it seems! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
It’s surprising the quality of some of these frozen meals! They have certainly improved over the years. This one is pretty good. The quality of the chicken is good and I enjoyed the coconut rice. It makes for a good quick meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The instructions are very easy to follow and very quick to prepare. I thought there was plenty of chicken in the meal and it tasted like I just made it. The texture was perfect and it had phenomenal flavor. This is my new favorite meal I'll have to eat every week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got this a couple weeks ago and it's so good. I love coconut and mango so having the flavors together was great. Hoping to get more soon as I could eat this all day!! It wasn't dry or ocer sauced. It seemed to have the right balance even for a microwaveable meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The mango chicken rice is my favorite Lean Cuisine. It’s so flavorful and tasty. The chicken is tender and juicy. The flavor is spot on. I keep my work refrigerator stocked with these and at home. They are super easy and quick. They are very satisfying and leave me full. The perfect amount of food. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love have a quick, healthy and convenient lunch option. As a teacher lunches have to be quick. Thankfully with this lean cuisine I don't have to have to give up flavor or eat junk. A few minutes in the microwave and a delicious lunch is waiting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is so yummy, the mango an the rice work together perfectly to make a yummy meal. It tase so good the chicken taste fresh an it’s all delicious. I will be buying this again for my lunches it’s so yummy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I typically eat a lean cuisine for my lunch during the work week. This new bowl was delicious! It was also filling!
--------------------
This was so delicious! The sauce had a bit of heat to it which was really nice. The rice and edamame were both soft and cooked through. The chicken was very tender. Kept me full all afternoon. I like that there is a lot of protein but the sodium is more than I prefer. I also would like if there was a bit more chicken, and if the mango was chopped a bit more. I had a few really big chunks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Mango Chicken with Coconut Rice Bowl has to be one of my favorite Lean Cuisine products of all time. It’s flavorful, low fat, 19g grabs of protein, and perfect for when I’m on the go. I could seriously eat this for every meal. My fiancé tried it the other day and loves it, too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
mango chicken and coconut rice bowl was very pleasing to eat. The taste and consistency was great. The portion was perfect. Taste like freshly made not frozen. Id buy these now more often. The line of different meals available is good. I recommend these to anyone looking for a quick meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I'm not much on frozen dinners but I really enjoyed the Mango Chicken and Coconut Rice option from Lean Cuisine! The flavor was awesome, the price was awesome and the varieties are awesome! I would and have recommended to some of my friends at work and I would definitely purchase this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really enjoyed the flavors in this mango chicken and coconut rice bowl. The cooking instructions were easy to follow and everything came out perfectly cooked and hot! (Maybe let it cool an extra minute to be safe!) This seemed to have a little more chicken in it than other frozen meals I’ve eaten in the past, so I was very happy about that. The flavors all work well together and it is sweet but has a little spice to it as well. It’s a great meal to take to work and eat in the office or for a quick and easy meal at home.

This is amazingly good! As a busy mom I sometimes try to find ways to save time from cooking. This lean cuisine bowl is convenient and ready in minutes. I like the fact that it has NO artificial flavors or preservatives and is made with natural raised chicken w/o hormones. This also tastes delish! It's a complete meal in a bowl! You can tastes the coconut flavor on the rice but More mango on this would be better though! :) Will definitely give other lean cuisine flavors too!

I really like this meal a lot because it is quick and healthy. I am always busy at lunch time and I like that I can warm this meal up in the microwave quickly and I have a healthy meal. I like the chicken, coconut rice, and mango flavors mixed together. I never had coconut rice before trying this but I really like it. I like that this product has 21 grams of protein in it since I am trying to get more protein in my diet. I like that this product is also gluten free since I feel better eating gluten free products. I will buy more of these products in the future for my lunches, I recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is delicious! The mango is tangy, but not too tangy and sweet, but not overboard. This is a fresh and healthy lunch option. I felt great after eating it, full, but not gross. It kept me full until dinner. The high protein and clean ingredients make you feel good about your lunch choice! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really like this meal a lot. This is my first time tasting coconut rice before so I wasn't sure what to expect. The mango, chicken, and coconut rice tastes so good together. I like that when I am busy I can warm this meal up and still know that I am eating healthy. This is a quick and easy lunch that I can eat. I like that it is gluten free since I am trying to live a gluten free lifestyle. The spiciness is perfect to me. I like that there is 21grams of protein since I also trying to get more protein in my diet. I recommend this product and will buy more in the future for my lunches.

The meal wasn’t bad. You could definitely tell it was a “lean” meal and not a regular one. The taste wasn’t my favorite. The rice was very mushy and the chicken lacked some flavor. I would be willing. To try a different flavor but probably wouldn’t buy this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am a wimp when it comes to anything spicy his dish was to spicy for me. The rice had a really good texture and they dish was creamy. The chicken had a nice flavor and texture. I wasn't able to taste the mango due to how spicy it was to me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This Lean Cuisine Mango Chicken with Coconut Rice Bowl is great for an easy and delicious meal! The bowl is the right sized portion and the chicken with the rice has so much flavor. The mango sauce is the right combination of sweet and spicy and is full of flavor. This meal is very filling. The coconut rice and the edamame taste so fresh. It is hard to believe that this is a frozen meal. I love that it is low in calorie but high in protein and that it does not contain artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.

It's a breaded chicken that seemed to absorb the sauce. So much so that it made it soggy. The flavor was minimally there. It seem like.it had enough sauce to cover all the contents of the meal. I've had a few different lean cuisine meals before. So i was surprised of the lack of flavor in it. Everything tasted good just needed more flavor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really like the taste of the mango chicken with the sauce. The coconut rice is really good and has alot of flavor. I don't like that edamame in with the chicken and rice because it doesn't taste very good with it. I wish there was a little bit more sauce, but the texture of the chicken and rice is really good.

With everything today, fast pace, and Covid it is hard to eat out it at wholesome place. However even with all this new way of life things still works out, I found this Lean Cuisein frozen meal. They are so convenient besides being and fast and easy to prepare. I have to honestly say this Mango Chicken with Coconut Rice Bowl is AWWWsome. The mango sauce is the best I ever perfectly sweet but tangy. This blow has tender chicken with actually grill marks, The Edamame, red peepers and coconut rice which is prepared not to soft, hard or sticky. It is the perfect mix for this Asian tasting meal. it is all put together in a Microwave safe bowl and ready to go. This is by far the best frozen meal I have had so far. Not high in price or calories either. This meal really satisfies my appetite I would highly recommend this to all my friends and family [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I never thought to try lean cuisine. It just never appealed too me. But i ended up trying mango chicken i must say it was very good. I didn't think it was going to have as much flavor as it did. Sometimes meals that have to do with watching your weight tend to not have as much flavor. I was surprised and i definitely will be purchasing more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Tasty and good bowl for a lunch when you don't want to cook but still want to have something healthy. Loved the mango chunks and the coconut flavor, it is just the right balance, maybe just a little to spicy for me. But I can't wait to try the other flavors! And I bit too small for my hunger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I like that it is a quick and easy meal. It tastes pretty good and I find it fills me enough. The chicken isn't the greatest, but it's fine enough. Especially since this is a frozen meal, I don't expect anything gourmet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I have been a fan of this brand for a while but this particular one is a definite winner for me. This will be my go to for weekly grocery shopping.

If you are looking for something different and new from your everyday dinner, I HIGHLY recommend getting Mango Chicken with Coconut Rice Bowl. The mixture of the mango & coconut made my mouth water. The chicken was chucked in nice sizes, however, I wish it had alittle more. The bowl had just enough sauce to mix the rice with chicken. There was no particular item th as t was overbearing. It was a nice balance of flavors. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I got the mango chicken cocnut rice bowl since i am trying to keep healthy diet going and itnwas delicous. The rice was soft and i loved the cocnut taste to it. There wasnt much chicken in it but it was wondefully flavored of orange chicken. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I was pleasantly surprised with the Mango Chicken with Coconut Rice Bowl! Too often microwavable rice products do not heat up evenly but not only did this heat up evenly, it also made fluffy tasty rice! The flavor really packs a punch here and the spice is just right. I only wish the chicken was a little more flavorful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Mango Chicken with Coconut Rice Bowl is amazing! The tastes all come together and make the perfect combination. It leaves a wonderful taste in your mouth. Nothing is too strong in it. It leaves you feeling full, and satisfied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I want to eat healthy, whole foods. Due to Covid, my go-to salad bar at work is closed. So I'm eating more frozen meals. This is by far the best tasting meal I've tried! The mango chunks taste ripe, and the coconut flavor is just the right balance. The meal is hearty and filling even for my big appetite!
--------------------
I bought this last week and ate it last night. Most of the dinner is fine but the mangoes are very mushy. Also there was some spice that I ate at the end of the meal that I definitely did not like.
--------------------
The mish mashed formed chicken was disgusting visual and taste wise. I didn't like the spicy in it, needs to be more prominent in description, I wouldn't have bought it had I known. I kept smelling a fishy smell, big turn off. I ended not eating majority of the chicken, too nasty. One small piece of mango. Loved the coconut rice and endame. I would not buy it again. The frequency questions etc, are not applicable for this dish.
--------------------
A great lunch option for a busy stay at home mom, between laundry & chasing after my 1 year old & our 2 dogs!
--------------------
the mango chunks thats in this meals throws the whole thang off. but other than that its not bad
--------------------
I had to buy this product in another town, 40 miles away, but it was worth it! I like the new flavor, the chicken was good, no grisly bits, the mango was fresh tasting, and I can taste the coconut as well. Only "bad" thing was too many red peppers but, I just tossed some out.
--------------------
I love it. Very flavorful and lots of chicken. Loved the spice.
--------------------
Tasty meal as usual from Lean Cuisine, however, when I stopped the microwave to stir after 2:30 minutes I had to transfer contents to a regular bowl. One side of the bowl had melted into a spout shape. This is the same microwave I've always used and never had a problem with the old container design.
--------------------
I buy this exact one all the time and i love it, matter of fact it got me into edamame beans! But the recent one I purchased at a big chunk of cartilage in one of the chickens, I didn't realize until it was already in my mouth and I spit it out. Otherwise great product.
--------------------
This is the first time I've seen Mango Chicken with Coconut Rice at the store and was excited to try it. The taste was good but there were only a few small cubes of chicken - nowhere near the size or quantity of what the picture showed..
--------------------
I hate edamame and it’s in almost every Asian style dish y’all offer. Please stop.
--------------------
Not a huge fan of coconut rice, but this overcomes that and is my favorite lean cuisine dish. The sauce is fantastic and the Hocker quality is always great. My local store quit carrying these and I’m bummed. Definitely give this flavor a try!
--------------------
So I bought the lean cuisine mango coco chicken rice in hopes of a decent fast food to keep me away from fast food. I haven't had frozen dinners in some time and didn't have high hopes. I love this!!. It's got a light coco taste yet it's spicy. My first bite I thought wow I hope the other dinners I got are as tasty. I WILL be getting this one again.
--------------------
I have good luck with most of the LeanCuisine products, But this one was Very disappointing!! There were 3 small pieces of chicken that did not taste right. About 8 edamame beans and a few small shavings of red pepper & mango and that was it?!? Mostly rice and the whole thing just smelled bad when it came out of the microwave. Too Bad the quality control has gone downhill!?...
--------------------
Nice, spicy and good quick lunch, for a meal I add a piece of baked or grilled chicken.
--------------------
Very disappointed with this meal!! Cooked it hoping to have a light dinner. Mixed it up and noticed there was ABSOLUTELY no chicken at all in the dish!! No chunks no nothing.. it was all rice and some veggies. Very disappointing
--------------------
I have been eating these for a while now and they are usually pretty good. Last night the dinner was poor quality control and was soupy. Way too much water ruined the rice and diluted the flavor. It's a shame that so many frozen dinners have poor quality control for an otherwise good dinner.
--------------------
Bit disappointing, as the dish's taste was pretty bland. I'd humbly suggest adding some mango habanero hot sauce and a squeeze or two of lime to liven it up and add some much needed zip.
--------------------
Loved the combination of sweet and spicy. The coconut rice had great flavor. It was a surprise to my coworkers when they smelled it that it was a lean cuisine.
--------------------
I was not expecting this to be good... but I loved it. Definitely will buy again.
--------------------
Must have missed the word "spicy" in the smaller print on the front of the box. Smelled amazing while it was cooking. But man, it was WAY more spicy than sweet, IMO. So, I tried to tone it down by adding some frozen peas. Didn't help. Ended up downing some milk to kill the fire. Maybe I'm just a light weight, but will not buy this one again. Holy cow. On the up side, it's very visually attractive, with a decent amount of chicken. I just couldn't get it down. You win some, you lose some.
--------------------
Had to add honey and salt to dull the spice! Spicy is in the description but it's so small, I missed that when I bought it. They should put it in the title. Also the chicken was a mushy texture. Other flavors and textures were good, though.
--------------------
The chicken tastes good, the sauce is good. The rice dosen't taste like anything at all. I would rather not waste my calories on it.
--------------------
Pleasantly surprised! Delicious and a little spicier than I thought. Perfect blend of flavors.
--------------------
Bought this for the first time a week or two ago and just had it for the first time- YUM!! Sweet with a little spice, tender chicken, shreds of coconut and chunks of mango... I love this meal! One of my new faves!
--------------------
I bought and not chicken.......flavor its good but where is the chicken
--------------------
This is both my husband and my own absolute FAVORITE frozen dinner out there! Actually, he prefers this to even my own home-cooking! The flavor profile is mouth-watering, and portion size is more than adequate. We find ourselves opting to make this rather than cook or go out for dinner more and more often. You will not be disappointed!
--------------------
The perfect blend of flavors. So savory! Not too spicy, and the coconut flavor is amazing!!!
--------------------
I just had one of these for the first time and it is definitely one of my new favorites! Rarely have I come accross a lean cuisine I didn’t like except for one so far. But THIS one... WOW! Im stocking up for sure. The chicken was nice and meaty it had a sweet kick to it, Just perfect!
--------------------
I love this one it is my favorite one. I buy them an its what i eat everyday day for lunch .I love the kick it has to it .Im one who loves spicy and anything coconut especially . I even got my daughter hooked onto them .This one always seems to have limited amounts at the store and now im coming to see the package says limited edition on it .Please dont stop making this one its too good to stop selling it .
--------------------
I’ve bought this a few times, every time I have absolutely loved it! It’s honestly my favorite out there! I’m bummed that I can no longer find it.
--------------------
This bowl definitely has a kick to it! The amount of sauce was just right. The white meat chicken was delicious. I also liked that it came with other vegetables such as spinach,peppers and onions. The portion size is just right for one person. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I bought the Spice Market Chicken & Cauliflower Bowl recently to try. I am constantly looking for good low carb meals. I think the chicken and cauliflower bowl is pretty good overall.

I was chosen to sample this Spice market chix & cauliflower bowl. I'm big into spicy food. My taste buds were exploding with flavor. The amount of spice was just right! Even my 10 year old liked it. I highly recommend trying this meal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
As with most microwave meals that are diet friendly, there isn't much foot in this serving. O had to add more veggies to fill me up. There also isn't much chicken in the dish. However, it was very tasty and I do wish I had more. I like that it had rice cauliflower instead of white rice. The veggies weren't soggy and still tasted fresh. I just wish it was larger portioned.

--------------------
First time trying your product from this brand in general. The flavor was nice I personally am not a huge fan of frozen meals I just feel like a lot of them not all of them lose their flavor and or textures just from being frozen in general. But this one wasn’t too bad the spice wasn’t overwhelming the salt wasnt overwhelming. it was a nice pleasant healthy little meal to pop in the microwave and eat. I did enjoy the flavor is the textures and colors of this little dish in general. Nice sort of healthy little snack I say snack because I said that hungry LOL.

The chicken and cauliflower bowl is amazing! The White meat chicken was delicious. It has cauliflower, spinach, peppers, onions and raisins. A combination I feel like is brilliant.

--------------------
This was a easy, delicious meal to cook. In the microwave it took less than 5 minutes. The flavors in it have a Moroccan taste to it. There is raisins, chicken, cauliflower, red peppers, onions, spinach with lentils mixed in a red tomato sauce. It is definitely not overly spicy but does have some spice in it. The portion size is enough for one person. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The lean cuisine spicy market chicken and cauliflower bowl is a good meal for those looking to portion control, and eat a little healthier. Its only 220 calories and with 7 grams of fiber it turns those 26 carbs to 19! The flavors were good, reminds me of Indian food which I love! And with cauliflower instead of rice you won't feel guilty about eating it if your on that low carb lifestyle. The only con is its a bit spicy, but overall I would purchase again.

I love having lean cuisine for lunch at work. My coworkers they enjoyed them too. But we had never tried the spice market chicken and Cauliflower bowl. We fell in love with it now it is in my freezer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I honestly didn’t expect this to be very good because, let’s be honest, most diet food tastes like cardboard lol but this was actually really good! I couldn’t even tell that the crust was cauliflower. I’ve already bought more for my quick lunches. Definitely recommend trying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I tried the Lean cuisine spice market chicken and cauliflower the other day for lunch and it’s so delicious! The microwaveable meal has chicken, cauliflower, spinach, peppers and more. It’s only 220 calories and packed with protein so I would definitely recommend this to anyone on a diet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Couldn't have asked for any other brand better than this one. I found the meal to be very tasty and filling. Easy to prepare and heated evenly! I'm big on cauliflower so this was right up my alley in wanting to get this on my dinner table. It was very good and at a good price too. Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is a great low cal, high protein meal. For those that like to get their protein via a shake, this is an edible option that has as many calories of most average protein shakes. It's flavorful and tastes delicious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I was pleasantly surprised that a microwave freezer meal that was so easy to prepare, could taste so fresh. Most freezer meals have no sign actual meat that was not the case in this Lean Cuisine you could see the big chunks of chicken. I know that this will be my go to freezer meal from now on.

I absolutely am thrilled that there are cauliflower options for a quick meal! Lean cuisine has been a staple go to for many years now and j love that I can remain keto during my meal choices when I don’t feel like cooking. The chicken is flavorful and moist, the cauliflower is delicious and the sauce is so good. Yum yum, doesn’t break the bank or my diet! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am so excited about Lean Cuisine is starting to branch out even more and include lower-carb and other dietary concerns in their line of frozen food. This particular dish sounded great because I liked that there was grain in the dish but I could pick around it if necessary and the rest sounded like a great mix. The gist is the same as their other products. Quick, and easily ready to serve food. This is so great for people who don't have time to sit down to dinner let alone cook for themselves or others most nights. This took less than 10 minutes from beginning to end and that includes reading the instructions, opening the package, cooking it, plating it, and then letting it cool. My first reaction was "wow" because this packs quite a complex spice for a microwavable meal. I liked that I was picking up spices that you don't normally find in your run of the mill meals from a large line of microwavable food. I think what this missed for me was the savory or umami flavoring. I'm not trying to have a 5-star meal out of a freezer but there was quite a bit of spice and not enough food to back it up. I ate the whole thing but it was just a miss for me. It's not a big deal. Their line is incredible because there is going to be something for everyone and I am eager to try more of their lower carb options. The chicken and cauliflower both tasted of good quality.

This tasty and delicious microwavable frozen dinner is ready in minutes and it satisfies my taste buds and appetite. I absolutely love how tasty the ingredients are and I savor the flavor of it. This frozen meal contains white meat chicken with frozen vegetables. I would definitely buy these delectable microwavable frozen entrees and pop them into my freezer.

This meal is super easy to make! Just heat it up and enjoy! I think the flavors of the chicken and cauliflower are great and go well together. I will continue purchasing this for a quick and healthy meal when I'm busy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I’m so happy I tried the chicken cauliflower bowl! It is super tasty! I love the pieces of chicken and the raisins were a bonus! The cauliflower and veggies complemented the chicken well. Also the portion size was perfect and I feel full after eating it. I’m trying to watch my carbs so the fact that it is so low in carbs is great! I will definitely be trying the other new dishes they have come out with, because this one is delicious! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Trying to eat healthy. I purchased this and it wasn’t bad at all. It’s not too spicy it’s not salty and the portion was just right. This product is a must buy quick meal for anyone who wants healthy meals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I’m not a big fan of cauliflower so I was kind of scared I wasn’t going to like this and of course I wasn’t the biggest fan of it but I was able to finish it so take that into consideration. If you love cauliflower you will definitely enjoy this dish. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I love anything with chicken and cauliflower. Total bonus that instead of rice, its rice cauliflower. The flavor is there. Not bland the spice is just right. Only takes about 5 minutes from start to finish. Just wish portion was a little bigger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
This is my favorite Lean Cuisine meal yet! It’s such a different combination and had lots of flavor! The spice was perfect. It didn’t taste like a microwaved meal at all. I love the convenience of these meals and will certainly be purchasing more. Great food! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I got the spice market chicken and cauliflower bowl and ohhhh my goodness it tasted amazing .Had a great deal of chicken in the bowl so that was nice, but the flavor tasted just like something i would have cooked in my own kitchen. Highly impressed with the bowl and will definitely be buying more! Great for a lunch or dinner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Good texture, super easy to make and great for low carbers. The ingredients are not all that healthy but when in a pinch it's an option. Seems like love or hate type of deal. In my family we were split in half - me and my son liked it, hubs and daughter didn't. Could be a bigger portion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I usually try to stay away from anything processed but it's just too convenient to have on hand because my family eats a second dinner after I go to sleep. The texture is good, flavors interesting for sure. This is one of those love or hate meals. It's great for low carbers that are looking for variety and would otherwise be tempted to break diet.

I have tried so many different frozen meals but this chicken and cauliflower bowl is so delicious and filling. I have never been satisfied with just one frozen meal but this one did it! So easy to cook and easy to store in the freezer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is my new favorite flavor of Lean Cuisine. LOL I have been eating it for lunch everyday this week. It is a bit hard to find in the stores. Microwaveable so it was easy to make. Probably not enough for someone with a bigger appetite. But perfect size and great taste for me!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
I’m always looking for something healthy but with flavor and this is perfect. Spicy, a tad bit of sweet and not your ordinary frozen dinner. My store also had a few other flavors I’m excited to try so I’ll definitely be looking for more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Cauliflower is a word I usually step away from but in this I was mildly shocked. I may have normally given this a ignore but now I may need to venture further. This meal is not heavy but still filling and tasty too. I may add it to my rotation now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My choice was the orange chice and rice oh so good. The chicken had a orange glaze sweet taste I had to grab extras. I love them because I can save money for lunch at work just pop on the microwave and enjoy very easy to put in your lunch box im very satisfied with my purchase and the delicious taste I will most definitely share with family and friends and coworkers [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received my spice market chicken and cauliflower bowl. The chicken has a good flavor and texture. I am not a big fan of Raisins in my food but it didnt distract from the bowl. I love that it has cauliflower a much healthy option. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The meal was good. The taste is delicious. I love anything with cauliflower in it. It was seasoned very nice. I have already told my family and friends about the meal. My family went to go get the meal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I always want to eat healthy food to keep myself healthy but the problem is that I found healthy food is never tasty. So, I gave up eating healthy food totally, until I found the Lean Cuisine Spice Market Chicken & Cauliflower Bowl, which has just 220 calories for the whole package, and is amazingly tasty. Nowadays, I always keep this cook and serve meal in my freezer. After eating this meal, I don't feel hungry at all for several hours. Also, the ingredients in this amazingly tasty dish are very healthy as well as simple and very premium. It contains chicken with cauliflower, spinach, peppers, onions and raisins over riced cauliflower and lentils in a spiced tomato sauce. This delicious microwave cook and serve meal is ready in just minutes and can be kept frozen until I am ready to prepare it. Also, it does not contain any allergens. I have already recommended this Lean Cuisine Spice Market Chicken & Cauliflower Bowl to several of my friends and family and many of them have already purchased and ate and just love this healthy and tasty microwave meal.

--------------------
Absolutely the worst TV dinner I have ever had. And I am 76 years old and single I have had a lot of them
--------------------
Tasted like a Moroccan dish with the spices used. Was not overly spicy, the sweetness of the raisins do a great job of balancing it out. Would get again
--------------------
And someone in quality control needs to go too. This is almost as bad as the Spicy BaJa yuck I had yesterday.
--------------------
I’m always looking for something healthy but with flavor and this is perfect. Spicy, a tad bit of sweet and not your ordinary frozen dinner. Keep up the good work Lean Cuisine!
--------------------
I love the flavor and all the cauliflower!! Thank you :)
--------------------
All of the new bowls are high carbs counts in the 40s and 50s. This one has 26 grams of carbohydrates and has a really interesting taste. It's fairly hot in it's spiciness though so if that if that's a problem for you, you might not like it.
--------------------
Restaurant quality, easy to heat up and serve in minuites. I was really pleasantly surprised how tasty this pesto tortellini was!
--------------------
A bit pricey, however it makes an amazing meal when paired with Italian hot sausages!
--------------------
I like this a lot and have repurchased. Easy and quick but I don’t think it cooks consistently
--------------------
A favorite frozen meal. Easy to heat up for lunch quickly, and super tasty. I keep a few in the freezer at all times, stocking up when they're on sale.
--------------------
Great pesto flavor and healthy ingredients.  I was looking for a quick meal option and this was flavorful and very good.
--------------------
I buy this all the time, at least 6x's a month.  Usually, I get this on sale in store for $3.79 each.  Read the microwave directions carefully.  Ready in just 4 minutes!  It isn't homemade, but it is still good! 

ONE HUGE PROBLEM WITH TARGET IS,  THEY ARE ALWAYS OUT OF THIS PRODUCT.  I HAVE TOLD THEM TO ORDER MORE, BUT THEY DON'T.  ON ONE OCCASION THE EMPLOYEE SAID THEY WERE OUT OF STOCK, YET ANOTHER EMPLOYEE FOUND AN ORDER THAT WAS SHIPPED TO THE STORE AND NOT PUT ON THE SHELF.  TARGET NEEDS MORE EMPLOYEES FOR SURE!
--------------------
I just love this pesto bowl!!  Excellent fresh tasting pesto sauce that's not too bland or too creamy -- it's perfect.  Satisfies my craving for good pesto.  I always have a supply on hand.
--------------------
I love this pesto so much, it tastes great. I’m an Italian and grew up with my mother making my favorite dish, pesto, so I didn’t think I would ever accept it from any other source. This is my favorite pesto alternative because it tastes fresh and real. I love that Amy’s uses real, good ingredients. The pasta is good but I wish they sold the penne pesto meal in stores around me. I usually have this pesto once a week for dinner and it’s very easy to make when tired after working all day. I prefer the toaster oven method because I believe it probably tastes better than the microwave method would. Please never stop making this, I love it! I would love to buy more varieties of pesto dishes from Amy’s in the future.
--------------------
I love it!  Just make sure you completely stir the pesto sauce all the way throughout the tortellinis!  Highly recommend!
--------------------
the pesto sauce tastes weird....wouldn't buy again
--------------------
Good but could use more pesto
--------------------
Fantastic fresh flavor!! The pesto is scrumptious and perfectly coats each piece of tortellini! Very satisfying as well. Highly recommend.
