I love this bread, simple but very yummy, I like to toast it with butter or make big sandwiches. I always find 2 x for this bread at the supermarket so I keep a couple of bags in my fridge :)
--------------------
This is the BEST bread for sandwiches. Before I went gluten free I would use this at all times for any sandwich. It’s a good size to fit all your toppings and veggies and is always super fresh!
--------------------
Always fresh and great with eggs or a peanut butter jelly sandwich. Quick snack works.
--------------------
Not gonna lie, this is probably like my third favorite bread to buy, are usually go back-and-forth between three brands. Pepperidge farm honestly makes really nice perfectly sliced, doughy in all the right ways that you’d expect your sandwich bread to be. ￼￼￼
--------------------
Sometimes you have to throw your dream ingredient list out the window and accept that you can’t mess with perfection. The only bread for BLTs.
--------------------
Very good. I love the softness and taste. I use this bread to make toast. And sandwiches. Just a great bread.
--------------------
Great basic sandwich bread. It makes a mean BLT. I also like using this for breakfast sandwiches.
--------------------
I love this bread. It is delicious used as garlic bread. So soft and crunchy when baked with garlic and cheese on it. It's a brand that has never let me down and is sffordable.
--------------------
Favorite type of bread! Goes great with everything! Taste really fresh. I’ve used it for cold cut sandwiches and also grilled cheese. I would recommend this to anyone!
--------------------
This is the favorite bread in our house! It's super soft and tastes super good. My boyfriend won't eat anything other than this kind. In my opinion, it's the best bang for your buck!
--------------------
This is delicious! Makes excellent French Toast too!!
--------------------
This bread is excellent. It's a great source of protein and also tastes great!
--------------------
Dave's Killer Bread has changed the bread game for me!! Finally, a bread with wonderfully thin slices, dense, wholesome texture, & great flavor. Worth every dime! Thanks Dave! This bread fits perfectly in my new healthy way of eating. Congrrats on your success!
--------------------
This bread tatses good but it ALWAYS has a stale feeling. It's great toasted but my family hates it for sammies
--------------------
Dave’s killer White Bread is AMAZING! I love This line of bread products and for a white bread this is amazing. It has soft texture, good both toasted or straight out of the bag. The freshness doesn’t last long because it’s orgsnic and natural but leaving it in the refrigerator does help. The texture is not like their grain ones or powernut, it’s soft and great for sandwiches or kids! The price isn’t cheap but it’s organic and organic isn’t cheap but it’s helthier Compared to conventional bread. Enjoy!!
--------------------
This bread is addictive - just know that going in! I am a huge carb person, unfortunately, although bread is not typically one of my craved food items. However, this bread is amazing! It's soft and tasty, not bland at all. It's good for sandwiches, toast, or especially Avocado Toast. I wish Target would also carry the smaller slice version of this bread. This is a great white bread that's a bit better ingredient and health-wise than traditional white bread. I've found that all of the Dave's Killer Breads I've tried taste well and are filling.
--------------------
Yhis organic whole grain white bread done right, helped me loose 70Lbs!
--------------------
Yummy bakery bread! It was fresh and made a great egg salad sandwich. We love everything from Archer Farms.
--------------------
Very dry the bread is dry
--------------------
This bread is literally just a wider version of plain white bread. It’s tastes like nothing. Save your money and stick with Mrs Bairds.
--------------------
love this bread so much. its so yummy and only target has it !
--------------------
This bread is better then the the basic kind near the chip aisle. But not as good as a high end local or artisanal bread. Our family liked it and we will buy again. It is a great option and very soft texture. Since the loaf comes in a partial loaf all the pieces are perfect for sandwiches. This makes my family VERY happy that there are no unusable sandwich pieces!
--------------------
I love this bread but never can get any all out all the time. Other's must like to also. I need a place to get it other then Targets Can I purchase it on line ?
--------------------
Pepperidge Farm Original White Bread is my favorite...best toasted with butter. I like the sandwich bread for its shape, texture and mild “yeasty” flavor. Not too heavy, not to light. Perfect.
--------------------
Super soft and delicious!!
--------------------
Love this bread for kids. It’s so soft and nice size for sandwiches. The taste is delicious also especially for picky kids. I like the fact it’s whole grain white so at least they’re getting nutrition.
--------------------
This bread is great for sandwiches or toast it’s a very wholesome bread that’s good for you better than your alternatives it’s a little pricey but very well worth it has a great flavor I would definitely recommend it to others
--------------------
This whole grain white bread is a great lower calorie alternative for morning breakfasts. While I don't recommend eating bread everyday, it is a healthier option from time to time. It pairs deliciously with some strawberry preserves or avocado if you want something more savory. It toasts easily and doesn't have that bitter taste some whole grain breads have sometimes. You really get the best of both worlds, especially if you have certain dietary restrictions. The taste is too yummy.
--------------------
After awhile it has a strange smell.
--------------------
Bad taste. Probably the worst bread I have ever had.
--------------------
Very mushy. When putting a sandwich together, it just fell apart.
--------------------
Not the best taste and falls apart really easy.
--------------------
So, not the best tasting bread ever... but it was great plain white sandwich bread & again, the price is great too!
--------------------
The slice of bread is overall smaller then the average size. It also breaks very easily. The bread was actually breaking in my hand as I ate it. Keep in mind this never happens to me. Also the taste is a little off doesn’t taste like regular bread. I don’t recommend.
--------------------
Soft, cheap, tasty. I surprisingly enjoyed this cheap white bread.
--------------------
Taste just like Sunbeam bread!￼
--------------------
I like how soft the bread is, and is a staple in my kitchen. You do have to be gentle and not mangle it like if you're spreading something on it like peanut butter and jelly, but it's still me and my family's favorite.
--------------------
This really is the perfect white bread. 80 calories a slice, toasts up beautifully, has legitimately healthy ingredients and yet doesn't taste like healthy bread (not that I mind the taste of blatantly healthy bread, because I really love that too). I find Target doesn't carry the White Bread Done Right line in stores as often as some of the others, and would love to see this one, especially the thin-sliced White Bread Done Right, carried in more!
--------------------
I’m a Mrs. Baird’s fan but I like Sara Lee and Pepperidge Farm breads as a treat every once in a while. This bread is very rich, soft and fluffy. That being said, the only quibble I have with it is -it is a bit crumbly. I often prepare lunch for my husband and this bread doesn’t slice as cleanly as I’d like but it’s a minor thing.
--------------------
We typically buy Sara Less Wheat Bread. This was my first time trying the butter bread. It did not disappoint. This was another great Sara Lee product. It tasted fresh. I will be adding this in once in awhile to change up our bread for the week.
--------------------
Sara Lee Butter Bread is super soft and tasty. It is great for making sandwiches or even eating it plain. This is the only bread I plan on eating anymore.
--------------------
This bread is so fluffy. There was no need for butter. It had a nice buttery flavor but not so much so that it was overpowering. It is a great bread to make a sandwich with. Which is what I used it for. There is a generous amount of bread slices per bag. I plan on buying this bread again but I think a lot of people love it as it was hard to find it in stock on the store shelf.
--------------------
This bread tastes so good. It's soft and has great flavor and texture. It's ok to eat every once in a while as a treat but it's not something I'd eat regularly because it's high in calories and carbs.
--------------------
Love this bread!! Very soft and buttery. Great for sandwiches and grilled cheese. I will be purchasing this again.
--------------------
This bread makes the absolute best hot sandwiches! I have a picky eater at home so grilled cheese is a major staple in the menu here. This bread tastes great!
--------------------
Really good especially for garlic toast. Husband loves it
--------------------
I have been loyal to a certain brand of bread for a long time but I now have wavered and started purchasing this Sara Lee Butter Bread. It tastes so good and is so so soft. It's has more of a sweet taste to it and adds a nice taste to any sandwich. It stays soft longer then the bread i usually buy and the Sara Lee name remind me of freshness. This bread always feels and tastes fresh and my kids really like the sweet taste of it. My husband even likes it and he would need usually eat anything else so we're sold on it and will be purchasing it now more often. The bread goes good with anything
--------------------
My little one loves this bread! Is soft and delicious.
--------------------
My family is a big fan of Sara Lee breads in general and this is no exception. It may very well replace our regular brand. It's soft which is a key requirement for my family. We are not into stiff hard hearty breads and while this is extremely satisfying and does not leave you wanting or hungry the texture is super soft but firm enough you can spread whatever you want on it. Lots of breads tear with solid butter or thicker peanut butter and this bread did not. In comparison to the other breads we eat it's a definite first place finisher. So happy I was given a coupon for this bread free.
--------------------
OMG this bread is delicious ... Nice and fluffy and very tasty. I made grill chesse and it was so good!! Will buy again.
--------------------
The Sara Lee Butter Bread is a great white bread. One of my biggest complaints about white bread is that it is either spongy and tasteless or it dries out fast. This bread is an exceptional variety! It has a great flavor, and it's very moist and delicious. My new go-to white bread!
--------------------
This bread had a great flavor and was something I loved trying. I am typically a white/wheat person but this butter flavor was awesome! My family enjoyed it. I received a free sample courtesy of Viewpoints Sampling for my honest opinion.
--------------------
My kids love PB&J sandwiches! Sara Lee Butter Bread is already one of our favorites. It's always so soft and is a 'go to' for our family.
--------------------
I really love this bread! It's light and springy and has a rich taste. It makes great toast but it's actually excellent for PB&J. My kids loved it as well! It tastes just like white bread should!
--------------------
Sara lee is a great brand of bread! Always soft always tasty. Butter bread is good, although a little rich for me for.some things, its perfect bread for a ham, mayo, and pickle sandwich.
--------------------
Over all good tasting bread it wasn't as soft as I would have thought but it tasted good which is what really matters.
--------------------
This butter bread was so extremely soft and great for sandwiches. My family really enjoyed their lunches on this bread. I am not a fan of tough bread so this fit perfectly with our family needs. I will be purchasing this bread again in the future.
--------------------
I received Sara Lee Butter Bread for free in exchange for my honest review. The bread is very soft and it tastes good. It's a bit hard to spread anything on it because it kind of falls apart. It is a good bread if you want to make toast or just eat it plain. It doesn't hold up as well as other breads when things are put on it, all in all it's ok.
--------------------
I received Sara Lee Butter Bread free in exchange for my honest opinion and review. I have to say, I have always been brand loyal when it comes to our butter bread; however, this sampling has convinced me to switch! Sara Lee Butter bread is not only softer, the edges are softer as well. It makes the most delectable grilled cheese sandwich! This bread was so much easier to chew and far tastier than my usual bread! In addition, it was a much lower price. I highly recommend this bread!
--------------------
I had never heard of this product before I got to try it for free but I would recommend it! It was fresh and soft, my son enjoyed eating his lunch of it! Delicious bread!
--------------------
Wow! Found a new bread! I never thought bread mattered, so I just bought store brands. After having the opportunity to try Sara Lee Butter Bread, I learned that bread does matter. This bread has so much flavor...it is squishy soft and just smells amazing! Making a sandwich using Sara Lee bread took my sandwich up a notch! I had it with fried eggs, tuna, egg salad, peanut butter and jelly , cold cuts and as french toast. Each time I used this bread my family grew more excited that it took each creation up a level. I will forever be buying this delicious bread...it is so softttttttttttt and yummy!
--------------------
Sara Lee bread comes on top of my mind when I first shop for breads. This Sara Lee bread is super soft and delicious . The butter in it makes it soft and yummy . It contains wheat barley butter and also milk. I love the combination of Sara Lee bread and jam and it's super yummy. I gave this to my kids for school snack and they loved it too. Sandwiches from these bread are a bit hit in my family and it's a perfect and complete breakfast. Contains no high corn fructose syrup and that makes it healthy too. My husband is very impressed with the softness in this bread. Overall i prefer buying this again .
--------------------
Bread was awesome, Soft, Great buttery taste. I would buy this again for sure for my family. I tried it with and without butter and both ways were great.
--------------------
This Sara Lee Butter Bread is amazing. I purchased this in addition to our regular bread. I have seen it many times in the store and passed it over and there was just something to the thought of butter bread that did not appeal to me, especially since I do not like butter. I was amazed at how much this resembled potato bread in taste (which is our favorite). We ate this with lunches and with spaghetti for dinner. Everyone in my house loved it and it will now be present in our home on future shopping trips.
--------------------
I have to say this is the softest most tasty sliced bag bread I have had in a long time. The bread stays soft for over a week with no signs of aging. The taste is amazing. I made a turkey sandwich for my daughter, my other daughter had PB and Jelly. We made grill cheese the next night using the same bread. This bread is a keeper and I'm very happy I had a chance to try it. Never really thought to purchase butter bread. I'm happy I did! It's a keeper!
--------------------
Sara lee butter bread is one of my favorite breads. It has a nice fresh taste for being packaged. It has the right consistency of a soft butter flavor. The quality of the bread is great and always fresh when I buy it. I have heard of this bread before participating in this program and I buy it regularly. I would recommend this bread to other people that buy packaged bread. This is one of the better brands out there. I will continue buying sara lee products along with this flavor.
--------------------
I love this bread! I have to take sandwich's to work and I normally have to cut the crust off but with this brand I don't have to! I would definitely recommend this brand to all my friends
--------------------
This Sara Lee butter bread taste good but for me and my family there was no butter flavor to it. It taste good but like regular bread. It toasted up nicely. I Made a veggie burger sandwich with it and it was good. The entire loaf was gone the day after I got it, we made a cheese spread and made cheese sandwiches with it. It was all yum yum. It's good bread but not buttery or butter flavor.
--------------------
We received this loaf in exchange for an honest review and was so delighted upon trying. Remember that bread from when you were a Kid that was super soft and super fresh and you would take the crusts off and ball the middle part up in your hands? Well this is similar but buttery better!!!! Nostalgia it is!!!! Will definitely purchase the next time I'm in the grocery store
--------------------
Really fresh product. Just a hint of sweetness to it. My daughter loves this instead of white bread for her peanut butter sandwiches!
--------------------
This bread is a great value. A lot of breads don't last but this bread has a lot of slices in each loaf. It is great to have on hand throughout the week in preparing school lunches.
--------------------
Sara lee butter bread is my favorite, it's better than the regular white bread. So fluffy, soft and not easy get break when toast it, so yummy
--------------------
While I have used many of the Sara Lee products I hadn't had the butter bread before. These is a wonderful product! It has a slight butter flavor and it tastes wonderful. I especially love the density of the bread. It makes a fantastic French toast! This bread is great for everyone.
--------------------
This bread is very good we used it to make grilled cheese and it's the best butter bread I've tasted.
--------------------
Makes a sandwich great. Nice thickness to the slice. Toasted well nice and crunch. I would buy this again.
--------------------
I received this as a free sample from Viewpoints, in exchange for a honest review. I love the buttery taste this bread has but I noticed that the tops of the bread starts to feel real hard in just a day or two. I will try again to see if I can have a different experience. I will recommend this buttery bread to my friends.
--------------------
Taste is fine but it’s super chewy and sticks to my teeth. I don’t typically eat white bread but decided to try this because it seems to be quite popular. Not a fan so back to whole grain.
--------------------
Can I just say I love this bread. Taste fresh. Great for grilled cheese sandwiches or toast in the morning. It is more “softer” than other store bought breads but I prefer that so for me it doesn’t me much.
--------------------
This bread has a good taste and texture. Since buying this, this is the only white bread my family will eat.. I highly recommend it for grilled cheese.
--------------------
Love this bread! It’s very thick and really good. I would highly recommend this bread if you like thicker bread.
--------------------
I have never written a product review before, but this bread was so bad I had to. This product is not bread. I don't know what people are talking about when they say it is light and fluffy, it is a dense sticky texture and it's way too sweet. it is overly manufactured garbage, this thing was made in a lab. it's like a grainy cake. it is not like any artisan bread in existence. it is like what a focus group of people who have never eaten bread would say bread should be like.
--------------------
we love that Artesian bread than Maier! So fluffy and thick.
--------------------
this bread is really soft and good for sandwiches
--------------------
Wasn't the greatest, but I'm also not the biggest fan of Artesian breads. I tend to keep my sandwiches simple, but this would be great if you were making grilled cheese and looking to invigorate it a bit.
--------------------
Love this bread so soft and fresh like it was bought straight from the bakery. Really recommend this product.
--------------------
I truly have to say that this bread is completely different in a good way. The slices are thick but so soft and make a sandwich that is out of this world. I am not sure exactly how it works, but the bread is thick and when you bite into the sandwich it is soft to eat, but it is sturdy as it stays a thick sandwich. I found this bread amazing.
--------------------
very savory and wholesome
--------------------
I toasted the product and had it with cream cheese and jelly. The bread held up and had a crunch to it. It also had a soft center. The bread is a hearty bread and is great for sandwiches, toast and plain. I will definitely be buying and recommending this bread to my friends, family and colleagues because of the high quality and hearty bread quality.
--------------------
I'm completely in LOVE with this bread. It's soft, thick and makes the absolute best grilled cheese sandwiches. It has a great homemade flavor and is my go-to bread when I want to be indulgent. I can't wait to try making french toast with it.
--------------------
This bread is amazing, we usually just buy regular cheaper bread but I'm making the switch to this from now on. The bread reminds me of a potato bread, it's super soft but doesn't tear easily like some other breads.
--------------------
Love toasting this delicious bread and eating it as is. It is absolutely delicious.
--------------------
We did not really like this, but it was ok. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.
--------------------
With no artificial flavors or colors I know it's a healthier alternative for my family. I grew up eating Sara Lee products and still use them to this day. Generous sized slices are so moist and full of flavor. Perfect toasted, grilled or used for a sandwich. A loaf does not last long in our home.
--------------------
At first I was a bit skeptical about this bread, as I bake a lot of my own breads homemade, so it takes a lot to impress me when it comes to "bakery style bread." I must say, for a store-bought packaged loaf of bread, I was quite pleased. The bread is very moist and fresh, giving you that "fresh-baked" impression, and it even has a little big of that springiness to it that gives you the freshly made mouth-texture. It is good for either sandwiches or toast, which is not the case with all bread. Some breads are best only for toasting, others only for sandwiches. This bread is soft enough to be used for both, which makes me happy! I really enjoyed this bread and my kids loved it too!
--------------------
Tastes so good!
--------------------
Sara Lee Artesano Bakery Bread is not only delicious, but also made with no artificial colors or flavors. These are two of the most important factors when purchasing food for my family! They want the freshest bread and I want a healthier choice for them. Sara Lee is a product I know and trust and will be purchasing again and again!
--------------------
This bread was so delicious! It made wonderful toast, didn't fall apart with condiments on it, stayed fluffy and didn't break down like other breads. It has a homemade baked flavor! My whole family loved this bread! We are switching to this brand of bread now!
--------------------
This bread is so versatile. We won't buy any other kind of bread anymore. Alone or with a sandwich, it's delicious.
--------------------
Sara Lee Artesano Bakery Bread was light, airy and delicious. It is versatile and high quality. I would highly recommend it. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review and these thoughts are of my own and haven't been swayed.
--------------------
I loved this bread! It's a bit tougher than the regular Italian bread that I'm used to, but the freshness and the taste is to die for.
--------------------
The bread was good. Good assortment of flavors
--------------------
This is my first time eating gluten free bread and I hadn't heard great things but wow was I surprised. Biggest plus is not feeling bloated after a sandwich!
--------------------
I'm really particular about bread. I love this bread! I made BLT sandwiches with an egg and avocado for dinner with this bread and it's so good. Soft, moist, and tastes very fresh
--------------------
I am always skeptical about bread as my entire family and I are diehard fans of another bread brand. When I think of Sara Lee, I always think of sweets! So my expectations were not that great prior to trying this bread! I was very surprised by the softness of the bread! It is incredibly soft and not sweet like I thought it would be. It actually tastes really good! It makes the best deli and grilled cheese sandwiches ever! I also love the fact that it has no high fructose corn syrup or artificial colors or flavors in it! My whole family loved it and now they purchases it regularly! Trying something new actually paid off because now I have two favorite bread brands! I would most definitely recommend this bread to everyone!
--------------------
So thick, delicious, and feels rich. It was affordable and everyone in my family loved it! The flavor was awesome and the soft texture was wonderful.
--------------------
I truly appreciated the quality of this bread! I made me think I was eating a homemade bread sandwich! Not to hard.. Perfect! Great tasting!
--------------------
This bread when I first looked at it I didn't think it was going to be good but it really is good I know I'm going to buy more its thick but didn't taste thick its soft and delishes would be great for grilled cheese
--------------------
I have never tried this bread up until a few days ago and it is great! The taste alone is good, and It has the perfect consistency, especially for making sandwiches for lunch!😉
--------------------
I prefer Sara Lee bread so when I got the chance to taste Artesano, I knew I would be hooked. I was right this Bread tastes so much better than your average bread.
--------------------
This bread is really delicious. Toast and add butter. Or toast and add cinnamon. Great for breakfast or with a burger. This is just as good as any artisan bread and it's available everywhere.
--------------------
Just seeing this bread it on the shelf it looked amazing! You can tell it's high quality. I made several things with it for myself and my kids and we all loved it. It was perfect for French toast and grilled cheese! Thick slices but so soft and didn't tear apart.
--------------------
Amazing bread! Gave one less star because it comes in a small size loaf but the actual pieces of bread are a large size.
--------------------
When I when to get this bread the package looked fancy so when i got home I decided to make breakfast for dinner and my whole family loved it i made french toast the next day too it is filling
--------------------
Wanted to try something new and this bread was pretty darn good. I love the thick cuts and it's a perfect size for my lunch sandwiches. Toasts very well too with the crunchy outside but soft inside. I've added it to my weekly grocery list!
--------------------
Picked some up for chicken salad sandwiches. Amazingly soft and delicious, the price was $2.49, which isn't cheap, but isn't too expensive either. The taste is great. Recommended!
--------------------
The best bread! So Fresh tasting! Makes every sandwich amazing!
--------------------
It tastes great. I’d rather buy bread with more fiber and whole grains but my kids will not abide. It’s a healthy compromise since it sure beats Wonder. They like it for sandwiches and cinnamon toast.
--------------------
The hearty white bread is the best hands down next to home made french and italian bread !!! It is very soft and easy to digest especially with ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome ! I cant afford medicine so must watch what i eat and ??c. Ccz.. Emma Hardie Skincare Moringa Renewal Treatment Mask
--------------------
Great taste and always fresh!
--------------------
Best White bread I have ever tried. The texture is perfection and perfect for toast with peanut butter or butter. It had a hearty flavor as the name implies, and the whole grain goodness my body craves.
--------------------
This bread is delicious. Definitely worth the money, the taste with sandwich meat, grilled cheese, you name it this bread is it!!
--------------------
These slices are very large, Great for sandwiches, Grilled cheese, Toast. I like the double packaging. A slight sweetness but not overpowering.
--------------------
This is THE BEST bread! Seriously just try it! I finally found my go to!
--------------------
Totally delicious! I am always looking for a high quality, thick bread for my sandwiches. I hate the kind that are so thin and floppy that they tear when you try to spread anything on them. This bread is thick and just dense enough without being too heavy. Excellent! Highly recommend.
--------------------
We love this white bread. It is very hearty and compliments sandwiches and makes fabulous toast. As a Registered Dietitian, it would be great if you could make 1 slice of this bread approx 15 g total carbohydrate / slice.
--------------------
You know when you take a bite of something, and you feel yourself be ruined for anything else? This bread does that.
--------------------
The bread is good, but the double plastic packaging is a huge and unnecessary waste of plastic.
--------------------
This is my favorite bread! Great flavor and very soft. Love it!
--------------------
Dense and soft, tastes great for sandwiches and toast .
--------------------
Hands down one of the best white breads I've had. So soft and hearty! I love it for toast, french toast, grilled cheese.
--------------------
I bought this bread for BLTs and it was so good, I ended up using it for sandwiches and toast. It was even good on it own. So soft and tasted super fresh. Highly recommend.
--------------------
Literally the best bread I have ever bought. This bread is perfect for sandwiches... toast... french toast... literally anything you can think of. My favorite is just eat a slice with some butter. Its a little pricey for a loaf of bread... but I usually buy the store name (Harris Teeter, Kroger, Great Value) bread for like 88 cents. I don't mind spending the extra money on this delicious bread.
--------------------
I was very disappointed with your new hearty white new and improved you had the best hearty white out there it taste like a lower brand of bread not good at all I have eaten the old hearty white since I can remember please go back to the old recipe now buy market brand hearty white it is better than your new and improved please make people happy again
--------------------
This actually tastes like real bread! I basically hate all other store bought bread; it's all either dry or squishy soft. This makes a delicious sandwich. Perfect !
--------------------
Fluffiest bread I've ever had. They're good for PB & J and Nutella sandwiches.
--------------------
Ugh. I was so happy to find a whole grain white bread, and even though the slices are small, it’s so much tastier than wheat bread. But then I finally read the label and realized it’s not really “whole grain”.. the first ingredient is enriched wheat flour, which is exactly what I’ve been trying to avoid because my husband is diabetic. There is a some whole grain flour in the mix, which is why it is on the label, but this is a little deceiving in my opinion.
--------------------
By far my families favorite bread! It taste great seems to always be soft and fresh on purchase!
--------------------
This bread was soft and squishy, just like white bread should be. It toasted well. Unfortunately I only got to try one piece as my kids ate it all before I could try more!
--------------------
Very tasty, soft, and fresh. Made excellent sandwiches that were not soggy when loaded with condiments.
--------------------
This bread is wonderful and soft. It has great flavor and adds great taste to any sandwich, recipe, snack or toasted. It is a quality bread that I feel good about giving to my family and have purchased it again and again. It's our new go-to bread brand.
--------------------
Sara Lee Soft & Smooth Whole Grain White Bread is a great product. I was suprised, I didn't need to use it for almost a week after I got it, and it wasn't stale. We finished off the loaf without it ever getting stale. It tastes great, too, and is made with whole grain! It's my new favorite bread!
--------------------
I tried to like this bread but the texture is a little off. Im not a fan of whole grain so that might be why I struggled with likung this one. My family didnt enjoy it either but we're used to standard white bread.
--------------------
This bread makes peanut butter and jelly so nostalgic. I usually buy whole grain bread which tends to be not as soft but this was a great throw back to my childhood. I would purchase this again for the sole purpose of sandwiches.
--------------------
Whole grain bread that looks like white bread is an awesome invention. My kiddo won't eat "brown" bread so I can give her whole grain bread that she'll eat. I'm buying this from now on.
--------------------
We love sara lee bread and this one is on the same level as all the rest
--------------------
This is the only bread I ever buy. It's perfect for toast and sandwiches. It doesn't fall apart when spreading condiments on it, which I have experienced with other brands. I would definitely recommend!!
--------------------
My kids didn't notice the difference from regular white bread to the soft & smooth whole grain white bread. We are permanently switching to this in my home.
--------------------
Sara Lee Soft & smooth while grain white bread is very fresh and great tasting. Makes great toast. The kids cannot taste the difference. A win in my book! No more white bread in this household.
--------------------
My favorite bread
--------------------
Makes great sandwiches and stays fresh.
--------------------
I like that the bread doesn't fall apart when putting toppings on the bread. This bread makes great toast too.
--------------------
I had not tried the Sara Lee Soft and Smooth Whole Grain White Bread until testing it out. I use whole grain bread while my husband likes white. This is a good compromise for us. My husband said it tasted better than whole grain bread but not as good as normal white bread. I thought it tasted better toasted than plain. It wouldn't necessarily replace getting our seperate breads all the time but maybe once in as while. I would suggest to someone who was looking for s healthier option than white bread but didn't want to commit to whole grain.
--------------------
This bread is really good. At first I was skeptical because we have always bought the same bread but we tried this and really like it. We make grilled cheese with this bread and many other things we love and it was good with all recipes. My kids could eat a loaf of bread a day if I let them and they really liked this. The taste is great!
--------------------
I really like this bread, my son loves it for toast and sandwiches. The fact that it is whole grain too with the white bread taste is really nice. I highly
--------------------
Very moist fresh homemade taste!!
--------------------
We were pleasantly surprised at how different the Sara Lee Soft and Smooth Whole Grain White bread tasted compared to our normal brand. The bread is very soft and tastes so fresh. Compared to other breads, we've tried this one is by far the best one. Our sandwiches taste so much better when we use the Sara Lee Soft and Smooth bread. The loaves are slightly smaller than some other brands but I will choose quality over quantity anytime.
--------------------
It was a very delicious moist bread.
--------------------
Omg!! I never used Sara Lee bread before but I fell in love. I made sandwiches for dinner and the bread was so soft as if it was just made that day. Me and my family really enjoyed those sandwiches.
--------------------
I am impressed with this bread, first off it is so soft,has a great texture and flavor and I love how they incorporated whole grain wheat into white bread! This bread is perfect for making a late night sandwich or for anytime! I highly recommend this bread,it's yummy,soft goes great with so many things! I got this product for purpose of review all views and perceptions are my own.
--------------------
I always buy turkey and cheese for breakfast. This time I wanted to try sliced bread instead of a roll. This sliced bread from Saralee was just what I needed not too filling and perfect for my lunch.
--------------------
Never would have guessed it was whole grain. Soft and moist. Perfect for a sandwich or toast in the morning.
--------------------
This is also great for people who hate wheat bread it looks white but they don't know right product
--------------------
This bread is delicious whether you are making a sandwich or making toast this is definitely the go to bread. I enjoyed the flavor and so did my family, will definitely buy again
--------------------
I like how it's taste and soft, great for toast, sandwiches and bread pudding. So fluffy and tasty.
--------------------
I eat these for lunch daily. Always soft and tasty.
--------------------
These are the WORST!! I purchased these To make with Chicken Souvlaki and these were inedible. They were crumbly, dry, impossible to cut through. I tried warming them in the oven, that didn’t help, it only made them drier. I microwaved a couple and I still couldn’t cut them to make a pocket. They just turned into a gross pile of crumbs. Garbage.
--------------------
Pop in the Microwave for 10 seconds. Delightful! (I am Employed by target)
--------------------
These are terrible. They were hard one day after purchase, and the first day I could not even open the pita, as if it was not cut in the center.
--------------------
Hard as a rock, not sure if it is always like that. I got this in a grocery pick up, otherwise I would have never purchased bread this hard
--------------------
This pita bread may be fine for dipping but don’t dare try to use it for gyros. It is too dry and doughy to open and fill. Warmed up, cold, with a knife, thumb, spoon - I tore all four in the package, making them unusable for the gyros I painstakingly assembled.
--------------------
They were great! Great price
--------------------
The Simply Balanced pita bread that this replaced was much better. The Archer farms version is hard, dry and bland. Im hoping it gets better.
--------------------
Contains high lectin whole wheat and soybean. Kind of defeats the purpose of creating a healthier bread and then adding the ingredient you are trying to avoid.
--------------------
Bread is one of those things that I never thought I would review...it is like extension of me. In any case Oroweat Organic Rustic White Bread is delicious. The large toast size is filling. Normally I buy wheat bread but this time I bought this wheat bread. I like the packaging - shows clearly upfront it is organic, non GMO, no preservatives. Although the caloric amount is big for the serving size, I am ok with that. I enjoyed the taste and price point. I used it for sandwiches and french toast. It holds well. I will definitely buy again.
--------------------
I loved this bread. Soft, tasty.....made for great sandwiches!
--------------------
First I must admit that I don't usually like white bread, but this bread had more texture than normal white bread. We used this bread mostly to make sandwiches with because it made wonderful sandwiches. It is firm but not hard and holds up well for sandwiches. It is much better than plain white bread because the texture seems a little denser or heavier. My family loved it. I did make toast with it too. It was the best toast I have ever had.
--------------------
This has to be some of the best white bread I've had in years. I used to be a Wonder bread kid,but oh boy this OROWHEAT IS TOP NOTCH. My family loves the extra big slices in the morning with breakfast,i love my sandwiches to get me full. It's clean and natural and my new friend in the kitchen. Thank you for the coupon i am a true fan and hope others join my happiness.
--------------------
This bread is definitely different from most white breads you find on the market. It is a richer, thicker bread with a fuller flavor. If you want a sandwich bread that takes your sandwich to the next level look no further. I made a BLT that was out of this world. We also made garlic toast as well as french toast. The french toast was amazing and wasn't soggy like other breads tend to leave it. It held the egg much better while still leaving the inside slightly bready. We did enjoy it very much!

--------------------
I try to buy organic wheat products as much as possible, since learning how much round-up is used in conventional crops, but my kids don't like bread with much texture to it. It's nice to be able to buy a white bread with the texture and flavor they want without a side of glycosphate!
--------------------
We love Oroweat bread, but this new Organic rustic white bread was a complete hit with my kids. They actually preferred it to all other bread that I buy. It was healthy and great tasting.
--------------------
I was surprised how tasty this bread was. Definitely a wonderful change from my usual bread. I will always buy this bread from now on.
--------------------
Oroweat Organic Rustic White Bread was delicious and very soft. I like that it is an organic bread and is made with 100% whole grains.
--------------------
I got this bread at ththe grocery store one day and thought I'd try it. My kids don't like the typical wheat bread so I thought this would be a nice substitute. The bread itself is so good and tasty. Kids loved it. It holds together well when spreading peanut butter. Its thick but not too thick and even the crust is good.
--------------------
I had a hard time finding this bread in stores. That is really my only complaint. This was a great tasting white bread that has great ingredients. I love that it's organic. It was great made into toast with butter and jam. It was also great when I made a sandwich with it and the bread held up well to that. My family all loved it as well. now that I know where to buy it, I will try it again if it's on sale. Not on sale, it's a little more than I typically spend on a loaf of bread.
--------------------
This bread is SO good! I even got it by my picky kids who only like plain old nondescript sandwich bread. And they loved it...I didn't even say a word, I just put it in their lunches! It's a hit!
--------------------
I normally stay away from white breads but I really want to try this one - and see what organic and rustic tasted like in white bread. It was surprisingly good. Very, very soft - almost like a sponge which was a bit offputting at first but when toasted it turned to 'just right' texture. Mild flavor - which went well with all types of sandwiches and toasts. My favorite was an avocado toast. I was pleasantly surprised that I liked this bread and will be willing to purchase it again.
--------------------
We enjoy toasting this bread in our Panini as a hot sandwich. I like that it's a healthy, organic white bread, which is what we prefer.
--------------------
I personally like bread that is soft to the touch, so this one did not really impress me in that sense. It was also a little dry for my taste. However, it did make for some pretty good french toast. My 12 year old daughter did like it very much though.
--------------------
I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this bread was!
--------------------
I first used the bread in the morning. I made toast with a little bit of butter and it was just perfect. Really enjoyed the texture and the taste. I also Felt good eating it as well as giving it to my son knowing that its organic.
--------------------
I made a ham, lettuce and tomato sandwich and the first thing I noticed when biting into it was that it was a little dry. It also didn't have really good flavor and stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth.
