My cat absolutely loves these! I have tried other wet cat food and he doesn't eat it. I have tried other flavors too but he loves these ones in particular.
--------------------
Wish they would have more choice in packs as Signature Tuna seems to be in a lot of the packs. One of my cats refuses to touch it, takes a sniff then paws the floor or cabinet in protest and comes back crying at me. Other cat takes a few bites then walks off. Bowls are usually still full by next feeding time (I feed them once in the morning and once in the evening with dry food if they want in between). In contrast the Salmon is gone right away. I do not know if there is something in the formulation of the Tuna, or I am getting bad lots but my cats think there is something wrong with it. I do like the easy open packs.
--------------------
I mix this with their dry food for a little better more flavor and as a treat from dry all the time. Try not to do it to often.
--------------------
Salmon is my cuts favorite flavor. But its also a hard one to find. Tuna is a close second.
--------------------
Perfectly portioned sizes so you don’t have to store the other half of the can in the fridge! This is a great way to get your cat the perfect portion food!
--------------------
This is the only wet cat food I feed my cats. The portion is a perfect serving and they love the flavor.option.
--------------------
My cat loves this food, the variety and serving size is perfect.
--------------------
I no longer waste cat food - these are the perfect size for one serving for one cat ! And my cat loves them!
--------------------
My cat’s favorite flavors
--------------------
Perfect portions for feeding 3cats.
--------------------
The perfect portion cups are perfect for my cats. The size and shape of the cups prevent them from eating too fast, they were a total godsend when I discovered them years ago.
--------------------
It made a rescue cat very happy. Her poop was a lil watery put overall she really enjoyed it.
--------------------
I bought this cat food for my cat wanting to give my cats something different to try and they went absolutely crazy ! They really loved it ! I also enjoyed how they have the food in perfect half size portions.
--------------------
My cat loves this food! He will eat this over the more expensive brand every time.
--------------------
I have two cats one being a super pickie eater, based on the fact that she likes it I'm all in, I think it's good.
--------------------
My cats love it. Perfect portions literally. It’s priced well at target. I love that I can have it delivered too!
--------------------
The only kind my cat will eat, arrived on time and undamaged :)
--------------------
My cat meows frantically every morning until I feed her Sheba!
--------------------
Cats love this brand and this variety. The do not like Sheba pate.
--------------------
This is my elderly cats favorite foos. She's 16 years old & her teeth aren't very good but she is able to eat Sheba Perfect Portion Seafood Cuts in Gravy like she's starving. Believe me she's not! Her favorite flavor is the seafood of course. My l;ast shipment was 6 days late & when the package finally came she was spinning circles waiting for me to oipen her food. It was gone before I left the room. My Pretty Girl Precious loves Sheba!
--------------------
I love the idea of portioned out food for cats. It's so convenient. The gravy version is a favorite in this household. I like that the first ingredient here is chicken broth and that there are no artificial fillers. I often see coupons for this brand in the paper too.
--------------------
My cat used to just lick the gravy off the wet cat foods I would feed him. I tried Sheba pate perfect portions a few years back and found that my cat would eat most of the solid portion. Sure, they're more expensive than other brands, but my cat had spoken. When I saw the Sheba CUTS, I had to try it and boy was my kitty happy! Bart licks the plate clean every time I put the food out, regardless of the flavor. What more could a pet-dad ask for?
--------------------
My cat goes crazy for these, I give him one portion every other day and he meows so loud he gets so excited!!!
--------------------
My cats love this food. I like the portion size.
--------------------
My cat just loves this food. Will purchase again.
--------------------
I rotate Sheba with Blue Buffalo wet food for my fifteen year old tiny indoor skinny kitty. She's always been a naturally lean "supermodel" kitty, but at a regular vet check up several years ago she was down six ounces so I decided to tease her appetite with wet food in addition to her regular dry food. She regained the weight plus two more needed ounces. She's healthy and doesn't have a bony back so common in senior year kitties. She eats one to two portions daily. I swap to Blue Buffalo when she leaves some Sheba behind, and then to Sheba when she leaves some Blue Buffalo behind. She's a happy and athletic kitty who hasn't yet slowed down because of age so I'd say this is good noms.
--------------------
This food is perfect for my little kitten. She loves it. I love it because I don't have to run to the store too often. The variety if perfect.
--------------------
My cat just loves this food. Will purchase again.
--------------------
My cats loved the different flavors. The amount of food in each little container was perfect for 1 cat.
--------------------
My cat LOVED this food; we got the "Perfect Portions" multipack with 3 different flavors. All 3 were pate style (smooth, mushy). Out of the Savory Chicken, Delicate Salmon, and Roasted Turkey, I think she liked the salmon the best, but it's hard to tell because she gobbled them all up. I was nervous to switch her food, but there was no problem. I will buy this to mix in with other brands and flavors from time to time. My only complaint was how the food "juice" splatters up on my wrist/arm when peeling off the aluminum sealed top. It's on there very tight and you have to squeeze a little. Well, when you get it open, watch out, because a little bit will splatter out. It was difficult to get a grip on the little aluminum tab. The white tub part is recyclable. Convenient to have 2 sections and no putting cat food in the refrigerator! We only have 1 cat so these portions are perfect.
--------------------
I received this in exchange for a review. My cats love the food, it is not my usual brand. I have a love hate relationship with the packaging. The individual portions are great, but the amount of packaging seems like a waste. I will definitely purchase these for my cat sitter to use when we go out of town. The price is higher than my usual brand, so I will purchase for a treat.
--------------------
My cat can be a picky eater, especially with wet food. However, surprisingly, she really likes all of these flavors! Normally she likes more brothy/liquid based wet foods, but she has been liking these pates. Portions are great too.
--------------------
My cat loves this food. She's older so the texture makes it easy to eat. She seems to have more energy and her fur looks shinier.
--------------------
The Sheba multipack of chicken, salmon & turkey pate wet cat food are a hit with our cats. I like the variety of flavors and that you don't have to feed it all at one time. You have the option of feeding half for now and half for later with the break & serve portions container the food is placed in.
--------------------
This is the first time I have tried this brand of food with my cat and I must say it was a success she LOVES IT. She's really picky with different flavors and meats so I was surprised when she enjoyed all 3 varieties. Thank you!
--------------------
When I saw these perfect portions I thought for sure they would be great for my cats because they never eat an entire can of food, or even half! However my cats are extremely picky and turned their nose up at the bowl when I offered it. In fact one even tried to bury it. The third cat, my street savvy rescue, attempted a bite and then walked away. I plan to keep trying, maybe the other flavors will entice them. If not I will donate them to the cat shelter where they will be more appreciated.
--------------------
cat loved the product, she couldn't get enough. product is portioned just right for smaller cats, easy to open and can be served either straight from the container or pours out super easy with no mess at all. would gladly buy again
--------------------
I have 4 cats and they usually don't like pate cat food but all four LOVE Sheba Perfect Portions. One even purred as he ate! I will definitely buy this again.
--------------------
My cat loves these, eats them all up! Wet cat food is much healthier for cats, and the three flavors were all enjoyed by my kitty!
--------------------
Well since I do not eat cat food, I will base this on my cats reaction. I have two cats that seem to like different types of wet cat food. One cat is not a big fan of the solid kind of cat food that can be chopped up with a fork. She prefers gravy liquid type of cat food. So she does not care for this food at all. The other cat will eat nearly any wet cat food out there but usually leaves food in her bowl. The second cat loves this food. It seems to be the perfect amount in the container. I do not need to clean the bowl when she is done because she eats the whole thing every time.
--------------------
I have two cats that I feed this food to. One will eat just about anything and loved this cat food. The other is picky and will not eat any chunks. This pate style is perfect and easy to squish. No upset kitty tummies either! I'm not completely sold on the two chamber individual plastic containers it comes in. It is unnecessary wasteful packaging and I don't see much benefit in it since I remove it from the container before serving anyways.
--------------------
My cats love Sheba and I love these perfect portions. They love to share so I will open one half of two flavors for them and they both take turns eating one flavor then move on to the next. They love all three flavors and there is never any leftovers. I think these are perfect for the home with one or more cats.
--------------------
My cats enjoy this food - they seem to like the Salmon flavor the best (that one disappears off the plate the quickest) and the Turkey flavor the least, but they have been eating all of them. I like the convenience of the single serve portions, though I'm not a huge fan of the peel off foil lids. 9 times out of 10 I end up with a splash of cat food residue hitting me upon opening the container. I like the package size, each of my cats gets one of the single size portions twice a day so this box will last me 9 days.
--------------------
First of all this cat is picky when it comes to wet food mostly will stick to dry but so far he hasn't turned this down at all. Highly recommend for picky cats.
--------------------
My cat loves this Sheba Perfect Portions pate cat food. It has natural juices with a very soft pate that is easy to eat. I highly recommend this cat food to all cat owners especially senior cat owners because some senior cats don't like hard crunchy kibble food. It's convenient to have this 18 count twin pack as it has three different varieties. It contains 6 twin packs of Savory Chicken, 6 twin packs of Delicate Salmon and 6 twin packs of Roasted Turkey. The twin packs are very easy to break in half so the portion size is just right. My cat enjoys all three flavors and he has never had digestive issues with this cat food.
--------------------
I have several cats and I must admit that everyone of them loved this cat food. It is great for keeping track of portion size if your cat is overweight, but they enjoyed it so much they wanted more after it was gone. I was impressed with how moist it was when I opened it up. I personally scooped it out of the little container and put in on a small plate, but once the plates were empty I had to chase the cats down because they were carrying around empty plates they had licked spotless. Normally, I feed my cats dry food as the wet gives the diarrhea, but this food has not upset their stomachs at all. I would definitely recommend to any cat owners.
--------------------
I liked this product as it is s easy to serve. It's sometimes a little hard to open, the foil top, but then you can just plop the food into the bowl without using a spoon. No half of a can to put into the fridge. The serving size seems to be OK. Our cats like the pate foods. I like that there are three flavors in the package. My cat who mostly only eats canned food likes all three flavors - the salmon, chicken and turkey. The other cat eats both dry and wet and doesn't like the salmon. At first I thought the containers were not recyclable, because the recycle symbol is only on one of the two containers that are attached to each other. It wasn't clear to me why there are two attached together. This is a different brand than what I have been feeding them, but I will definitely consider purchasing this cat food.
--------------------
Amazing! Both cats like it. Mr. Very Sensitive Stomach had no issues. And Ms. Fussy Pants now doesn't want anything else. The major ingredients are healthy. The cats like all 3 flavors, though truly they seem to prefer the salmon. The packaging is very simple to use. Snap in half and each furry beast gets their own. Super Simple! Will definitely be buying this again.
--------------------
I have 5 cats and they tend to follow me around on the weekend, because after all these years they know that they get canned food on Saturday and Sunday. Well, they have followed me around every morning this week, meowing and meowing. I think they really really like the Sheba cat food and are going to drive me crazy everyday until they get it!
--------------------
First things first. My cats love this food. They get excited when I pull it out of the cabinet and devour it all in one sitting. So that is the most important thing to me, but just as important is how much I like to serve it. I am so grateful there is no metal can or sharp pull top. These light plastic containers are a dream to stack in your cabinet and easy to open and easy to rinse out and recycle! I am thrilled with that. I am impressed with the 18 ct. size package. Such a convenience compared to buying individual little servings of cat food and having them topple inside your shopping cart. I buy this and am set for a couple of months. I feed my cats wet food every other day so this will last and I will be going to the store for wet food much less often. I think the package is misleading at least to me, I just saw 18 ct. It wasn't until I got it home that I realized that was 18 TWIN packs. So actually 36 servings. That is fantastic.
--------------------
I picked this product for my daughter's cat. He is a finicky eater but loves this. I can't say he prefers one flavor over another.
--------------------
My siamese loves this sheba food. I perfer this container, since it is plastic and it is very easy to open. It shows a recommended feeding guide based on cat's weight, if it is a kitten, if it is pregnant or nursing. The box is light weight and my cat likes the roasted turkey one the best. I love that this is a variety pack that doesn't take up as much space.
--------------------
My cats absolutely love Sheba canned cat food! It's the perfect size for my two kitties to share, and the smell doesn't make me gag :) They love the food, and can't wait to gobble it. Would highly recommend! I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.
--------------------
My cat really loved this food! She's getting older and having some digestive issues, but had no problems with the Sheba food. I liked it because it came in convienient sized containers. I was also pleased as it did not have a strong smell like some other wet cat foods.
--------------------
Our cats love these. They typically don't love pates but they devour these! This is a great variety pack and the serving size is perfect.
--------------------
My cats arent that picky when it comes to wet food but theyve been scarfing these up! Would def purchase in the future.
--------------------
I have been purchasing these Sheba double packs for my cats for quite some time prior to being asked to review. My cats prefer the cuts varieties over the pate (which is what I received to review). That is why I only gave it 4 stars rather than 5.
--------------------
I received my SHEBA Chicken, Salmon & Turkey Pate Wet Cat Food - 18ct thru the Target Bulls Eye program for free, but thanks to Target, my cats have been introduced to a delicious and healthy new to them cat food! My indoor cat, Callie is very interested in watching what I am about to serve her, so she watched me very curiously as i was opening her first Sheba wet cat food. I gave her a sniff and she tried licking the chicken salmon and turkey even before the cover was completely off the package! I laughed and put the cat food in her bowl. She sniffed again and took a bite, and then proceeded to eagerly eat and enjoy the remaining cat food. I like the mix of ingredients as my cats love all 3 foods and seem to especially enjoy them all mixed in one yummy cat food! Yes, I have already made another purchase as my cats are loving Sheba cat food!
--------------------
My cat loves all 3 varieties. These are the perfect portion size come in a nice variety of flavors.The package states 18ct which is really 36 portions and will last awhile.
--------------------
My kitties LOVE this Sheba food. They clean up every morsel. The portions are much too small for our large male kitties. They typically eat both sides of the package. One side as portioned just left them wanting for MORE food.
--------------------
This new pack design with single servings is amazing. My cat actually ate the whole plate. I dumped the contents on a paper plate and threw it away when my cat was done. Easy peasy.
--------------------
My cat absolutely loves this food! I think he knows that he's getting something special even before I open it. The package is convenient and I like that it's easy to clean and recyclable. I give it to him several times a week, mixed in with his dry food. He is sometimes sensitive to new food, but never has trouble with it!
--------------------
I have 4 cats. I am NOT the crazy cat lady, but my kids wore me down and I put my foot down at one cat per human in the household. They (the cats) absolutely LOVED this cat food. They came running when they heard me opening up the packages and took turns sampling from each other's plates. Not a single speck of food was left over when they were done with their dinner.
--------------------
I have two adult cats and I usually give them Friskies wet food. I tried these since they were in individual containers and I thought it would be easier to serve them. However, every time I opened the package a bit of the cat food liquid spilled out and got on my hands and/or on my counter. I was not a fan of that and do not care for the smell of my hands after I got the liquid on them (luckily the smell would wash right off). My cats enjoyed all the flavors and they ate of the food. I did not hear any complaints from the cats except that they wanted more!
--------------------
My cat loved this food! He comes running every time I'm in the kitchen just to get it. It's called perfect portions because that is exactly what they are, perfectly sized for a good meal. Other wet cat food my cat had a hard time eating in one sitting and then it's left out making my kitchen smell but he eats these and no smell. I also love that they are in their own containers so I just pull off the foil and set it down instead of worrying about finding and cleaning a dish.
--------------------
Our cat Finn is one fussy eater. After trying quite a few brands of wet cat food, we finally achieved "Finn approval" with this Sheba product. Comes packed in cute little trays. We serve just one tray a day, in two or three separate servings. (He also gets hard food.) Wish the peel-off cover would reseal better but other than that, this is good stuff.
--------------------
My 4 cats LOVED this meal in all the flavors included in the box and devoured them QUICKLY. Unfortunately, my cats have healthy appetites and they left still hungry. Portion size was too small. Also, the handy dandy smaller container was not a hit with the cats. They had a hard time eating out of - too small and slid all over the place which got them annoyed. I had to end up putting this on a small dish to make it easier for them to get at the food so they could eat it and also because it was a plate that would stay put and not slide all over the floor like the small plastic packaging the food came in. If they would increase the portion size and fix the packaging I would definitely purchase, but for now I would skip this.
--------------------
My cats love the flavors, and I love how it's portioned! The smaller portion sizes let me control how much each cat eats, plus since each portion is sealed individually, I don't have to open an entire container if I don't need one.
--------------------
Small portions for a big price. This cat food reminded me of a fancy restaurant. My cat is fed once in the morning and once in the evening, I believe the portions are too small for an adult cat. The only solution for this cat food is a snack in between feedings. I prefer aluminum cat cans because it can be recycled. Shelba is out of my price range.
--------------------
My baby girl is extremely picky about what she eats, but she loves these! It's great to have variety in order to keep my cat interested in her food. The best part is the portion size! It's enough to keep my cat happy, and I know she will finish her meal completely. I am not left with a half finished cup that I end up throwing away.
--------------------
My cat loves this food! He wants to eat it all day. Don't worry, he is only given it for dinner. I love the box it comes it. It is a great way to keep organized. The packaging of the individual food is amazing. The containers are made of a thick plastic with an easy peel off foil top. Also the containers are two half sizes which are easily broken apart by a perforated edge. This way your not wasting any food or trying to figure out how to reseal the package. This is an amazing product and I love the innovation of the packaging.
--------------------
We love the size and the portions packaged. The fact that each unit has 2 side is a major plus. This will allow us to continue dry food and give small amounts of wet. My cat does seem to really enjoy.
--------------------
My elderly cat is pretty picky with her cat food anymore. I'm pretty sure she is having harder time chewing dry cat food now that she's gotten older. I've been using another wet food brand that is similar in size to this, but she really just licked up the gravy part and left the rest. When presented with the Sheba brand, she immediately took to it and ate most of what I gave her. I like that the portions are smaller than normal cat food cans since she does not usually eat much in one sitting. She really liked the salmon chicken pate', so I'm eager to see how she responds to the rest of the flavors available.
--------------------
The Sheba Chicken, Salmon, and Turkey Pate cat food is a great meal to serve to your cats. They are made into "Perfect Portions" instead of a can which I really like because I don't need to use a spoon to get the food out. You just take the seal off and dump the whole portion into your cat's dish. I have two cats and they both enjoy all the flavors and the pate texture. My only complaint is that the strength of the cat food is pretty strong and I don't find the smell of cat food to be very good. I also really like that this variety pack contained three different flavors. My cats get bored of the same food again and again and this product gives you a variety.
--------------------
My cats love this food, and the packaging makes it easier to split the food between bowls, and allows my kids to participate in feeding without making a huge mess. The cups are recyclable, too. The cats usually mess around licking the juice off wet food and leave some of the pate on their plates, but this was gone in 5 minutes.
--------------------
FINALLY someone came up with smaller portions of wet cat food. How many times have you given your cat a can of cat food and come back to find half of it still there to dry out and get thrown out later. This product is so awesome for that matter. the cat food easily slides out of the container, no spoon or forking out needed, and rinses clean for recycling.
--------------------
My cats could not wait for me to serve them their dinner!! They both absolutely love the Sheba Perfect Portions multipack, all of their favorite flavors in one box, simply perfect.
--------------------
Cats are picky creatures. Ours isn't a fan of the pate food. But I love the size of the portions. They're perfect for when you want to not overfeed your cat.
--------------------
my chubby orange tabby is the least picky eater it seems.... but with this, she hesitates for some reason to eat it. eventually she does finish it within the hour(s). I thought I'd keep trying since this brand seems healthier. I tried the pate version. same thing. finally after a few weeks i switched her back to sheba. not sure why she isn't liking this brand.
--------------------
my cat loves it and she's a picky eater
--------------------
this is a pate, not flakes, which I assumed would be chunkier. my cat won't eat pates. just warning others!
--------------------
Overall this is the healthiest wet food you can actually give your cats !
--------------------
My kitty loves all 3 flavors, so we are subscribed !
--------------------
My picky eater loves it! Only brand I buy now.
--------------------
My finicky feline will only eat flaked can food. We use Blue Buffalo products for our dogs, so I was happy I found this variety pack from Blue Buffalo too. My cat literally eats this up in seconds so it must be good!
--------------------
My cats go crazy when I open the can and they have knocked the bowl out of my hand before because they were so excited to have it. I have a kitten and he has never had tummy problems with it. I bought it because it was on sale and haven’t gone back!
--------------------
My cat loves this food and it's healthier than many others. I made the mistake of thinking that they were 5 oz cans, not 3 oz but that's my fault.
--------------------
The cat likes it, except the chicken she eats it, but reluctantly. It says to feed 3 a day which is a lot! We give her 2 and some dry and that seems to work best. We will be ordering more.
--------------------
I am very picky of what I feed to my cats. Especially, when buying from the grocery store but Blue buffalo cat canned food is really good for cats or just their overall brand. Plus target gives you the extra 5% off when you use your Target red card.
--------------------
it sounded like it would be ideal. my cats just air buried it .no one ate any of them
--------------------
Both of my cats love Blue Buffalo and I love that they have better ingredients for them.
--------------------
I bought this on sale because I had seen it but, was hesitant to pay full price. I am so glad I tried it. My beautiful cats absolutely love this food. They will literally lick their bowls clean. They have never had any digestive issues after eating this food. Their happy which is what matters.

I have now decided to add Blue Buffalo into their diet.
--------------------
My 2 cats love it. They wanted seconds for sure haha.
--------------------
Like all cats, mine go through their picky stage.  They went on "hunger strike" a while back on the wet food; so needed to change up my game plan.  Thankfully they love this Blue Buffalo 12 pack.  Yes, more expensive than what I was paying for other wet cans but better than tossing food in the trash.  All 3 of my cats give the BB two paws up.
--------------------
My cat loves it. I love that she loves it and that it is very good for her. She is very old and It is helping her a lot.
--------------------
My cat LOVES this stuff, and it seems to agree with him.
--------------------
Great wet cat food with better ingredients. Our little one just loved this! His fur has been looking nicer since he's started eating this as well as Blue Buffalo dry cat food. A Mew-riffic cat food, paws down!
--------------------
My kitty loves this cat food. I will be reordering.
--------------------
Cat loved the food, I loved the price. I recommend and I will reorder in the future. Try it you'll like it.
--------------------
Bought this for my mom's cat because it's healthier. She really likes it.
--------------------
my cats love Sheba pate and with gravy but this has now happened twice when I've bought the big boxes of Sheba cuts with gravy from target. The box looks fine there is no damage to it but when I open it at home and go thru the packs of Sheba Every day when I feed my cats, there are cuts in the lid of the container and the gravy leaks out into the box and I'm forced to have to throw away the pack. So a box of 18 packs with 36 portions ends up being 18 portions because half the box has cuts in it drying it out making it not edible . So I would check the box before I left the store.
--------------------
My (very picky) cats love this food! They are not fans of pate but love the cuts. I like that I can feed them just half or the whole container, the only thing I don't like is that it is in plastic containers which are horrible for the environment.
--------------------
Pablo loves any flavor of these cuts! Always my go-to.
--------------------
My cats like this. I buy it because it's not made by nestle, who has a lot of human rights violations. Too much material in containers though.
--------------------
My cat approves!! I give him dry and wet food AM & PM. If I don’t give him the wet food and get side tracked, he comes and finds me and meows at me until I give him one of the perfect portions.... he’s obsessed with it!! He wasn’t a fan of the turkey so I’m so happy this pack comes with all except the turkey!
--------------------
I was adopted by a stray cat and when I reach into the box and grab a pack and she hears the snap of the two breakings apart she loses her mind. She becomes the most affectionate cat and the motor on her when she is consuming it is like nothing I have ever heard before. Plus the size is great since she eats small amounts but likes them often so there is little to no waste!
I just need a lesson on opening the container I can't seem to do without it squirting at me.  I feel Suga judging me. Human, you have one job and you just wasted apart of the best gravy ever.
--------------------
Food was dry and was either old or left to elements.
--------------------
Our finicky kitty likes this food and it’s was nice having my order brought out to the car so quickly!
--------------------
My cats love Sheba! Small servings are perfect for my cats.
--------------------
This is a good quality wet food. It comes in nice one serving pouches. Foil can be difficult to take off so be careful! But my cats love it! Definitely recommend this brand.
--------------------
Been using this from the beginning. Love that I dont have to worry about figuring out how to keep am unfinished can fresh or opening a whole new can for just a little bit of food. They have lots of different flavors too.
--------------------
My cat absolutely loves these! I give her 1 a day to keep her lean and she has a lot of energy. She knows the sound of the pack separating so she waits patiently by her wet bowl dish for this delicious stuff!
--------------------
My cats only want the cuts. I love the perfect portions. Its a win win for all. Yay for my household
--------------------
I love the portions of this wet food! It makes for a wonderful in between meal snack for my kitty, however the ingredients arnt the best for your kitty with byproduct but a little bit wont hurt. Im working on switching her brands but these portions are almost too good to pass up
--------------------
It made me very happy to see that your store carries my cats brand of food she’s very picky and that’s the only food that she will eat thank you for that.
--------------------
My cat loves this food. I like how it’s portioned time half sizes so that I can easily feed my cat twice a day without having to refrigerate the leftovers. My only mild complaint is that the container can be difficult to open but I’m sure it’s designed that way to keep the food fresh and contained. The price point is also reasonable so I will keep repurchasing this item.
--------------------
My cat normally doesn't eat cuts but when I gave one of these to her, she LOVED it! She ate it immediately!
--------------------
My cat loves it and it great potions
--------------------
My cat looooves this stuff and every flavor especially tuna. The packaging alone makes me chose it every time
--------------------
My cat enjoys this food. I like that there is a variety of flavors.
--------------------
That is very old has a weak appetite , she loves this though.  I ordered this item often. This last batch I’m not sure what happened but When I opened the box, about six of them  Head exploded like they got depressurized or something . Kind of gross and I ended up returning it to the store.
--------------------
I like being able to purchase my cats wet food in bulk. I have two cats so it's really nice that each package breaks in half to give each cat their own portion. I do wish that the box came in even number of each flavor instead of a larger number of one. It could be a little cheaper to match its competitors. Otherwise I really like this product.
--------------------
These perfect portions are everything!!! It makes for easy cleanup, easy feeding and the variety of flavors keeps my cats loving it. It’s so quick and easy and the perfect portion size for my cats that it makes no sense for me to feed them anything else!
--------------------
My cats loveeee the gravy! These are the perfect portions for indoor cats, which is great because you’re not throwing anything away.
--------------------
I have had to change my kitty's wet food numerous times because he seems to get bored with flavors and brands quite often. Thankfully I found Sheba wet cat food and gave it to him he had loved it since. I do however but the variety packs with both "cuts" in gravy and paté in different flavors. My kitty is small and ears small portions so this cat food is purrrfet for him. The food comes in small portions break away containers and the price is about the same as the other cat foods I have tried.
--------------------
My cat LOVES Sheba food. She doesn’t like the gravy in most foods, but when it comes to Sheba, she will eat the entire thing. Sheba is a staple in my house and I have at least 3 containers under my sink for my cat at all times. This cat food is also pretty cheap. It’s a great deal
--------------------
I feed one to my cat in the morning and one to her at night. She is really overweight so this helps regulate her food intake. She loves the cuts but not the pate! I would recommend to others! Sheba Perfect Portions Cuts In Gravy Premium Cat Food Multipack
--------------------
I’ve worked with a few super picky cats at the shelter that i volunteer at, and a lot of the picky cats like these. The only issue is that this is really not very healthy at all. But it’s better than them not eating. I also like the little portions.
--------------------
Easily my cats' favorite wet food. They both consistently eat their entire portion, which for one of my cats is very different from other wet foods I've given her.  They come running when they hear me crack the portions and follow me with tails straight up as I walk over to their food bowls. I usually feed them dry food, but use this a few nights a week to give them variety and increase their water intake.

It's a grain-free healthy food choice that my cats both love!
--------------------
My cats absolutely LOVE this stuff! They've even come to understand what the sound of breaking the two portions apart is, and they come running. I would definitely recommend because even my super picky eater loves this stuff.
--------------------
This combination of Sheba cuts is the favorite for my two cats, Cupcake and Cammie. This is not available at my local store and I took a chance to order online and am very happy with my purchase!
--------------------
The box set of Sheba is so convenient you have single size servings and you get a nice variety in the box. I subscribe and receive the box regularly which is very convenient for me. The price point is very competitive. Overall great value, my cats are happy and all is well.
--------------------
My cat absolutely LOVES this stuff. I've used many other brands in the past, but always went back to Sheba. And now it's the only one I buy. Thank goodness for Target's auto-ship program!
--------------------
Bottle babies have taken to this very well.
--------------------
The kittens loved it!
--------------------
Excellent product and good price
--------------------
My girls gobbled it up as soon as I fed it to them. They eat small portions several times a day which is annoying but that’s what they’re used to. Each can seems to be packed with meat which makes it a pretty good value. There’s no sauce which my Katniss normally loves but she didn’t seem to miss it here so a lil goes a long way compared to all the other foods that are full of sauce/broth.
--------------------
Great stuff ~ cats gobble it up
--------------------
The label and description are misleading. This is not flaked tuna.  It is more like nuggets and a pate put together.  I was very disappointed because it says flaked tuna right on the can. Flaked tuna should look just like the tuna a human would eat.  My cat looked at it and walked away.
--------------------
My cat live the 3 oz can of the same brand, but for some reason the tuna “chunks” are larger in the bigger 5 oz can andhe doesn’t like it. Sniffs it and walks away.
--------------------
Devoted Blue pet parents! So glad Target carries it now :) Blue Buffalo is quality, nutritious, HEALTHY food, w/great ingredients, no junk/fillers! **Think about it: would WE be healthy eating ONLY fast food/junk food? NO!** We should feed our furry family members quality food, too! We have fed our 6 babies Blue Buffalo dry AND wet foods their whole lives (ages range 2 - 8 yrs), and it's amazing. Cats don't drink much water, so it's vital to add hydration into their diets whenever possible. We keep Blue Buffalo dry food always available in their food dispensers, and we give them wet food as a treat/supplement 2x daily. Quality food gives them INCREDIBLY SOFT fur, good weight, and above all, HEALTHY furry family members (no medical issues, low vet bills). Blue is VERY affordable for such quality food :)
--------------------
I have a 2 year old male Manx. He has been terribly finigy, hard to please regarding soft food. This brand of wet cat food is just not for him. He won't touch it.
--------------------
My cat loved it. He’s a picky eater and usually just licks the gravy. Ate all of it.
--------------------
Having this cat food at target is very convenient for me to get for my cat
--------------------
My cat LOVED this... the first can! But, by the second, it was just "eh". So, great for occasional feeding of an extremely picky cat!
--------------------
My super picky boy loved this!
--------------------
Good supplemental treat to my cats dry food
--------------------
I was looking for a new salmon food, because I refuse to buy the little plastic individual serving things, and my old brand that started with an S discontinued their cans. My cat who has proved to be very fussy is eating this food wholeheartedly.
--------------------
Yes cats are finicky. After 2 years of looking for a healthy cat food that my vet recommended. I finally found Blue Buffalo healthy gourmet tuna. The first time I opened up can and put it on her plate she ate every bit of it. It was so wonderful to see her eat the food on her plate instead of snip it and walk away.
--------------------
My cat will eat it about half the amount I put out then just leaves the rest. Big complaint! The packaging was less than perfect - 6 of the cans were dented big time.
--------------------
It's nice to know that your feeding your kitten healthy, good food. My cat absolutely loves this wet food. Worth the money.
--------------------
So glad Target carries this food! My cat has been eating this brand since he was a kitten and is healthy and happy. Great food!
--------------------
Cat must like it, she ate it
--------------------
My finicky cat loves this flavor. Turns his nose up at some of the other flavors
--------------------
Like the single serving size.
--------------------
My cat loves to eat these as a special treat. I also also think the price is fair because you get two servings. However, the smell of the food lingers for a bit￼. Will definitely buy again￼￼.
--------------------
I started my cat on Sheba wet food shortly after rescuing her. It is her absolutr favorite food. She’s tried almost every flavor and they never disappoint. If I forget to stock up and run out, then try to give her another brand... she looks at me like I’m crazy. She sings me the song of her people in the morning and after work every day just so she can get her sheba. I love it too because of its ingredients. It’s Marnie approved!
--------------------
We have tried all of the Sheba flavors and he definitely prefers this one the most. He likes the pate' because he does not have many teeth, it's easy for him to eat and digest and I really like the serving size.
--------------------
Great serving size for my cat.
--------------------
My can't can't eat anything but this due to mouth problems. But please take out food coloring. My cat and I don't care what color it is.
--------------------
My two cats normally love your products, but the newly introduced,' delicate salmon entree' pâté was never even touched by them. They sniff & walk away. Main ingredient is not Salmon, but chicken, liver.
--------------------
My kitty demolishes this food every time. She is such a picky eater, I am happy to have found something she really likes.
--------------------
Just like the name perfect portions! I love the easy accessible container it comes in. My kitten looks forward to this every morning!
--------------------
My cat loves the cuts, but will not eat the pate. I have one of the large boxes and will have to give it away.
--------------------
My cat was having health issues, so I switched her to Sheba wet cat food. She loves this cat food and is doing much better! Thank you!
--------------------
so easy to open and no waste
--------------------
My cat will eat nothing else which is wonder. Problem is that she wants more and more. Being a senior living on SS I am finding it more difficult to keep up. Is there anything you can do to help? Coupons or?
--------------------
I hope that you will continue to produce salmon pate or Sheba cat is in trouble
--------------------
My cat likes only Sheba brand for soft food and refuses any other brands that we’ve purchased. This chicken pate is her favorite! So, cat is happy with Sheba & no complaints from us humans at all either. :) I’d recommend!
--------------------
A few months ago, my senior cat developed an intolerance for dry food. He began throwing up the food after almost every meal, lost weight, and was declining. He had begun laying in his bed and refusing to eat at all. The vet could not figure out the problem. He would not eat any canned food I tried attempting to entice him to eat. Finally, I tried Sheba chicken savory and he began to eat. He refused other Sheba flavors, but luckily I tried this variety. He is now back to some dry and mostly Sheba and has not thrown up in months.
--------------------
It is impossible to open this container without getting product all over your fingers and hands. The opening method needs to be changed. The cats response is rather "take it or leave it" so I will not be purchasing this in the future.
--------------------
I've been buying Sheba cat food perfect portions for over 3 years and have been satisfied with the quality and quantity since one container was more than enough for my small female cat. I just bought 6 double containers of "Gourmet Chicken & Tuna Entree". However, when I opened the container, I noticed that, unlike their other varieties, it was only 2/3 full. My cat gobbled up this small portion in no time and meowed for more. I don't understand why Sheba would sell a partially filled container. I will buy other varieties of Sheba products but I'll never buy this kind again.
--------------------
my cats really love it!
--------------------
My cats have never enjoyed wet foods until we tried out sheba.
--------------------
My cat Coco loves eating her Sheba wet food every morning for breakfast.
--------------------
all of a sudden my cats won't eat any of the sheba flavors. there is to much sticky gravy and not enough of the cuts or pate'. they sniff it and wait for the dry food. the recipe must have changed.
--------------------
Recent reviews are low on this recipe, and my cats will no longer eat this
--------------------
I bought this for my cat and now she doesn’t want anything elae.... thanks a lot
--------------------
I've bought these several times and my cats love them.
--------------------
I got this to get my tiny kittens used to wet cat food and off the bottle. They liked it a lot. However, the packaging is so egregiously difficult to use that I am returning it to the store. It is very hard to remove the foil overlay and even cut my finger once trying to pull it back. Also got the liquid squirted in my face trying to open the foil. Not worth the effort.
--------------------
This is literally the only cat food that my cat will eat. So good!
--------------------
My cat loves this flavor!
--------------------
I always buy many trays of Sheba. My cat loves the chicken-tuna flavor. It is a sad day when a store is sold out of this flavor.
--------------------
My 2 fur babies love this food!
--------------------
never thought to give her beef before, but she really enjoys it.
--------------------
My cat was diagnosed with IBD/IBS in 2014. He has been on an appetite stimulant in addition to his standard IBD meds. Approximately 7 months ago I switched him exclusively to Sheba. Specifically chicken cuts and pate. He has not had an appetite stimulant since he has been on this exclusive diet and is maintaining his wait with his standard IBD meds. I highly recommend this product!
--------------------
out of all the Pates I have bought, Sheba has the best wet food for my older kitties who have very few teeth left. It is extremely moist without being liquidy AND dense enough to satiate my kitties!!! I honestly have been struggling with finding moist dry food for them to eat throughout the day however your product is affordable enough to give them this in addition to the dry in the case they cannot eat the harder food. Bravo Sheba! I really would love to see you use the same genius you used in creating the wet food for developing a moist dry food!!! Thank you from me and my kitties❤
--------------------
Found mold way before expiration date. 2/1/2022. I am very disappointed
--------------------
My little angel simple love your pate line! I try to incorporate chicken and turkey but his faves are the tuna and salmon. At first, as a kitten, I fed him both pate and cuts, but he would would always leave at least a half bowl of cuts while he would consume the entire serving of pate and ‘ask for more’. He also loves your broth! Here is a suggestion: develop a gravy/cuts line. I’m sure he would love this. Thank you that your product is natural, I only wish to feed Sydney, the best!
--------------------
I have tried alot other brands, but my cats love Sheba. But having 2 cats it gets pricey. Would love coupons to help me....
--------------------
The beef is the best but i have to add plenty of water to it since its kinda think but thats what they want if to "soup it up" but the beef is the thickest & really needs water! my cats 2nd choice is Whitefish Tuna & they dont like the poultries or salmon.
--------------------
Olive is a very picky girl but she loves Sheba! She eats dry food and knows it’s treat time when she hears my pull back the top on her favorite tuna container!
--------------------
All my cat will eat.she has such a beautiful glow and so soft.
--------------------
I have been feeding my diabetic cat the turkey for about 8 months now. Recently the packaging has changed and the food is much darker and smells much stronger?? Did the ingredients change?
--------------------
Both of my cats love Sheba and refuse to eat anything other wet food. Even the high end brands get a nose turn. The salmon pate' has been the preferred flavor though we buy the triple pack for variety.
--------------------
My senior cat Rose was recently diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. She started getting very selective in her diet, avoiding dry foods because they were too tough to eat, then certain wet foods. Luckily, I tried feeding her the perfect portion of roasted turkey. She ate that wet food faster than anything I've fed her before. For a small cat, she can pack away quite a few portions, and has been able to put back on some weight since starting her medication. If you have a picky eater, these portions are the perfect size to try out. You're able to monitor the cats eating more closely if need be. I only wish there were larger portion sizes available to avoid container waste
--------------------
My cars love Sheba perfect portions. The fish flavors are their favorite but they like the chicken also.
--------------------
I have been buying Sheba perfect portions for a long time as it is my cat's favorite wet food. My cat Max is almost 14 years old and is a rescue cat. His favorite is the salmon but will eat other ones too.
--------------------
I could hardly get my 16 year old cat’s head away from the bowl as I was serving Sheba turkey cuts in gravy! She loved it. She’s diabetic, so I appreciate the pre-measured size of Sheba Perfect Portions.
--------------------
I have an 18 year old cat and in his old age is getting quite picky. He loves the Sheba Salmon Entree. He gets wet food daily and this is his favorite.
--------------------
Why mess with something that is not broken? The packaging and quality of your products Such as pate portions have changed.
--------------------
I've tried other brands and flavors and the delicate salmon is the only one he will eat, and he loves it!
--------------------
My cat has always eaten dry food. The vet discovered she has a severely cracked tooth, but is too old for surgery. Lately, I noticed she wasn't eating a lot.  Hoping the issue wasn't that she was leaving this earth, I felt maybe it was due to pain during eating.  I tried many brands of wet cat food and she turned her nose up at them all. This cat food is less expensive and she loves it, but only the Turkey. Ya, she is very picky.  I love the foil top and that they are small portioned.  She only eats 1/2 of one of the containers at a time, so the foil makes it easy to reseal and put in the refrigerator until her second feeding.  Also, since I have been feeding this product she has stopped throwing up, so it must be easy to digest for her. 
Very happy with the product.
--------------------
Our cat loves these and the seafood entree's are hard to find. I purchased it online which was purfect for us so we didn't have to waste time searching from store to store.
--------------------
My seven cats love this.  Four are female and three are male.  Their ages are nine to seventeen years.  Some are inside only, outside only and inside and outside.  Item is reasonably priced.
--------------------
Neither of my fussy cats would eat this after I gave it to them. They eat almost any other canned cat food or dry, but they won't touch this!
--------------------
My cat loves it. I feed it every other day with other flavor. Size is just right!
--------------------
Juicy, creamy, and delicious.  Buddy really enjoys it
--------------------
This was the tastiest cat food we've ever tried. We made it into little meatballs, and it's delicious with a dry red wine. It's a family favorite.
--------------------
My cat loves all the Sheba pate choices.  I like them because they are juicy and easy for my senior cat to lap up. Yes, the containers are hard to open, but I use a pair of needlenose pliers to grab and peel the cover back, no problem.
--------------------
normally i would rate it a 5 as my cats love this. but one of the packages I received, when I opened it, found mold all over the food.  I did call the maker of Sheba, who is going to reimburse me $1. this is not the fault of Target, but that of the manufacturer.  They say the food is actually cooked and sealed in the package itself and it does happen some times.  Be careful when opening to make sure all is fresh.
--------------------
My cat Zoe loves this.
--------------------
The quality is great and my cat really loves these. However, no matter how careful you are at opening the package you will get cat food juice sprayed on your hand, the floor, counter etc. Please make the pull tab longer or use a different glue!
--------------------
My picky eater licked his bowl clean!  He thought yummy.
--------------------
We feed a not so stray cat "Bunny" (we call her that because she has no tail), who actually was abandoned by the people who lived there before us. We love her so much, but we can't seem to convince her that we would love to give here a forever home. I love this portion size, its the perfect size for her. She can usually finish it, without all the other cats in the neighborhood trying to steal it. She loves the taste of it. She makes a funny sound when she eats it, nom nom. I was giving her fancy feast an she does not make that sound. She usually will finish it pretty quickly she like it so much!!
--------------------
My cats love the pate. I wanted to switch to only wet food to get away from so many carbs in dry food. Problem is 3 serving for every 5pds of cats weight. I have a 13pd and a 10pd cat. That would be 6 servings each twice a day???? That's a Heck of ALOT of food!!!!!
--------------------
My cat is 17 going on 18 and over the last year she has become a really picky eater. So glad we found Sheba Perfect Portions. She loves, loves, loves every one of the flavors offered. Thanks for a great product I can feel good about feeding her.
--------------------
My 18 year old cat has become a very picky eater and mostly only touches wet food now. This is one of her favorites
--------------------
Perfect portions cat loves it
--------------------
My cats like it I’m happy there’s no grains but I wish you didn’t have meal
--------------------
Excellent! My cat’s favorite!! Arrived on time with no issues. Perfect!
--------------------
My cat loves these. She meows constantly when she sees the package, until I set her dish down! Perfect serving size too!

--------------------
I was feeding my cats Fancy Feast Medleys chicken until it started to make my diabetic male sick. I switched to this product and they eat it all and some days beg for more. They both love the pate! However -- I have a devil of a time trying to open the package -- I have to use pliers to pull back the foil. Is there an easier way to open it?
--------------------
My foster cat is new to tuna flavors, but she does enjoy these little half meals and she can eat it all in one sitting and no leftovers to refrigerate.
--------------------
My kitty loves this brand and I love the variety, small portions, and ease of use.
--------------------
I have 3 cats who love the Sheba Chicken Pate. I used to buy the combo Chicken and Turkey Pate, 6 double portions each, but my cats definitely favored the chicken. I didn't realize I could buy just the chicken. So glad I discovered I could! My cats love the taste and the consistency and they never seem to tire of it. I will continue to purchase this as long as they make it. Hopefully, it will be around for a long time. One of the suggestions I have is for the company to go back to selling it in the can. It holds more than the Perfect Portions and it is easier to open. I still highly recommend this product.
--------------------
i have a picky eater here and i try and give both my babies one "wet" food and one dry food serving a day. well i went through multiple kinds until i found this one! both my cats love it and whine during feeding time till i give it to them! this has never happened with any food before! 10/10 would definitely recommend!
--------------------
My cat is going crazy over all the Sheba pates. The pates have the consistency of a mousse. He just devours these. He is an older cat so does not eat an entire Perfect Portion at each meal, thankfully since these are expensive. He may get 3 meals out of one packet. At least for now, Sheba Perfect Portions Pates are his favorite wet food.

--------------------
One of the only wet foods my cat will eat- he doesn't really like wet food. I know weird!
--------------------
Bought the roasted turkey. When opened noticed the entire portion was covered by a green color. It was brown on inside when cut into. My cat smelled it and turned up his nose. Expiration date is 2020. Rotten? Have more in pantry but afraid to feed to my cat.
--------------------
makes a mess opening the package, you almost have to cut top off, it is stuck so tight
--------------------
I switched my 4 cats from blue wilderness cat food because it had to much fat and my cats where become over weight and when I started feeding them sheba perfect portions they started slimming down and being more active and shedding less and there coat was getting better. Overall sheba has been improving the quality of life in my cats that I haven't seen in a while and I'm never switching back
--------------------
My 20 some year old cat was getting painfully thin and refusing to eat. She slept under the bed almost all the time. She didn't seem to like any food I gave her. She wasn't grooming herself very well and needed assistance. She is now eating Sheba She loves it. She has gained weight and is grooming again. She is playing a bit and she is out and about socializing and looking out the window. I know not to expect a lot more time with her but it is great maximizing the time left. Thanks a bunch!
--------------------
My cats love Sheba. However I don’t know how much to feed them daily. Both cats weigh about 10 lb. each.
--------------------
this is a really good cat food but my cat doesn’t really enjoy any flavor besides the beef one!!!
--------------------
my cat has been eating dry food for almost all of her life with the occasional wet food treat. she’s 15 and lately she hasn’t really been wanting to eat and she lost a bunch of weight so i knew i needed something to give her hydration and was easy on the stomach. she not only loves it but the beef flavor is her absolute favorite!!! she doesn’t really like the salmon one that much but that’s okay!! really great for cats to gain weight if needed or just as an everyday cat food. highly highly recommend to people with cats who are on the older side of life (or on the younger i think all ages would enjoy) and/or love things that smell so gross. the food doesn’t smell the best but if she eats it i really don’t care how it smells.
--------------------
I started buying this brand a month ago and I've noticed they prefer it to the other brands. I try to stay stocked so I won't have rowdy ruff boys
--------------------
About six weeks ago I ran out of my usual food and a friend picked up some Sheba for me. Music will not touch anything else! I'm amazed that his fir is so much softer . . . and far less hair balls. So glad we found this.
--------------------
I've only been able to ever find it in the 48 servings seafood variety perfect portions pack and while my cats are a fan of the other two foods (salmon and whitefish/ tuna) included this is hands down their favorite of the bunch; they leave a clean dish every time I feed it to them which can't be said about nearly any other wet food I've ever fed them. My partner also has a cat and this is her favorite wet food as well.
--------------------
My 14 y-o cat needs to get medication, which I have to mix into food as she won't accept my putting it directly into her mouth. This Sheba chicken + tuna is the first food I found she would eat all of, not leaving any in the bowl. I gave it 4 stars because I would like it better with a higher protein content.
--------------------
Alabama is a "self-feeder" of dry food and never a picky eater when it came to wet food until I gave her Sheba......now she practically asked for it by name. I would love to be able to buy or order a variety pack that contained one of each flavor.
--------------------
I used to be able to buy Sheba cat food in cans. I cannot find the cans any more. all that is left to buy are perfect portions. There is so much packaging waste that i will never buy them. Neither the containers nor the plastic tray are recyclable. It is incredible in these times to be so wasteful. i would be delighted if I could buy cans again because my cats like the foods.
--------------------
This is the only flavor my little female will eat, but she was not a wet food eater before I got her, so she'll probably grow into the other flavors. She will fight my big male cat for this, and she always wins! My big male loves all the flavors.
--------------------
My cat loves it so much he sneaks into our cabinet late at night, picks them up and tries to rip into them.
--------------------
Every couple months our cat's tastes change and she switches from Pate to cuts then back. But she always loves Sheba!
--------------------
Good luck opening the package without cat food spraying all of you.
--------------------
I like to feed my two cats grain-free, high-quality, healthy cat food. They, however, reject all of those options, and choose to eat this inexpensive, widely-available option. Great! They love it - this seafood entree flavor, specifically. This flavor is only available at many pet stores in a combination pack, which comes with flavors that, of course, my cats despise. Target has it for sale individually, and at a better price!
--------------------
Not only is my cat picky, but once he tasted Sheba Salmon he won't touch anything else!
--------------------
I have finally found a quality cat food both of my indoor cats will eat and after a month they haven't gotten bored with it. YEA!
--------------------
My cat's favorite flavor
--------------------
This is the only wet food my kitten will eat. It’s gentle on her tummy (she’s never thrown it up) and her coat has become really soft and shiny.
--------------------
We have bought this from pet stores and recently bought from in store at Target, my cat immediately threw up all of the wet food after eating it. And same thing the next day. Something is wrong with this batch or product! Many bad reviews on consumer reports.
--------------------
Good quality ingredients in this cat food brand. No over-powering smell either. Flaked food is easy to scoop out. My cats do not throw up after eating this food.
--------------------
My eight year old cat has more energy and is definately healthier since starting on Blue Buffalo cat food! His vet noticed his weight has reduced as his activity level has increased. I would certainly recommend Blue Buffalo cat food for your cat's health.
--------------------
Good quality food that cats really like. I feel better feeding them a higher quality food.
--------------------
I like that they are portioned, my picky cat won’t eat cold wet food!
--------------------
My kitties just love the taste! Very filling for them as well.
--------------------
This is absolutely my cats favorite food. They absolutely meet me at the door every time I walk in ready for their Sheba cuts ( any flavor, they love them all!
--------------------
Cats both like this food.
--------------------
Both of my cats like this food
--------------------
My cats love this brand. When I go to the store the shelves are almost empty. What's up??
--------------------
These are perfect portion sizes & my cats love this brand.
--------------------
This is my first time buying this product for my cat. He really likes it & I like that is has a perfect portion especially with cats if you give them more theyll eat a lot but I love this portion. It doesnt smell strong like other cat foods. Its chicken & vegetables in gravy!! Cat is happy
--------------------
Cats seem to love it. Easy to split between the two.
--------------------
As the homeless cats I care for age, their eating habits have changed drastically. They now refuse any shreds and most canned cat food. However, these tasty dinners went over BIG!! They smell delicious and vegetables are the healthiest finishing touch!! Would really love it if they came in larger sizes, giving us the options to choose!!
--------------------
I rated it a 1 only because my cats didn't like it. But the portions were good, convenient packaging.
--------------------
My rag doll cat finds this irresistible. Tried other more expensive brands but Sheba is rock solid
--------------------
I'm confused. The package of this exact product says 43 calories per serving. But here is says 33. Which is correct? Note: I have a sick cat who is not eating anything else. These 10 calories are important.
--------------------
My cats love this. They will clean their dish and not leave a morsel. Couple of my kittens had never had this before, they go crazy when I serve this at meal time. Perfect amount without the waste.
--------------------
I was so excited to find a variety that had vegetables in it as my two girl kittens simply love vegetables in their food. They were as excited as I was to be able to offer it to them. I wish these were made in bigger portions so I could share it with all my 7 cats! I highly recommend you try this new product for your cats. They will just love it!
--------------------
While Felix will only eat Sheba wet cat food. The portions with the veggies are his favorite.
--------------------
I bought these in order to give my cats other options, you know how cats are, picky...they just love it.
--------------------
My kitty loves this wet cat food and the veggies are good for him
--------------------
The cat really liked the food, but I really object to all the little plastic containers, even though they get washed and put in the recycle bin. He will eat two in one sitting, coz he's a big boy. Isn't there a more eco-friendly way to package this stuff? 
Also, my store doesn't seem to have any of the other flavors in stock, but probably that's not the fault of the producers(?)
--------------------
My two cats love the Sheba Cuts and they are grain free which is what the Vet ordered. Great product!
--------------------
My Ileana (kitty) will eat it, but prefers others better that have more gravy in them (this has a little, but not much).
--------------------
I have not personally tried this, however, my cat "Sox" loves it! What more can I say?
--------------------
My cat loves these. She meows constantly when she sees the package, until I set her dish down! Perfect serving size too!
--------------------
My cat loves these. She meows constantly when she sees the package, until I set her dish down! Perfect serving size too!
--------------------
Cat eats most of a serving (half of container) but would eat it all if it were pate.
--------------------
Happened upon this Sheba medley's at target and thought I would buy a couple. After my 6 cats all were nudging each other away from the shared plates. I went back the next day and all of the Medley's had been purchased.
--------------------
My Granddaughter's kitten loves this food, especially the two with vegetables! I would like to have more kinds with vegetables to provide more variety.
--------------------
Happy cat and happy owner
--------------------
My cat loves this new flavor! He really loves both new medleys!
--------------------
My cat loves this new flavor!! He always empties his bowl!!
--------------------
My cat gobbles this food up when it's time for her to eat. She sits and waits at
4 o'clock every for her Blue Buffalo.
--------------------
My elderly (22 y/o) cat was in serious decline. He wasn't eating much, and was very thin. Desperate to find something he would eat that had a soft texture, I tried this food. He loves it and has been eating it in increasing amounts over the last month, putting on weight, and his coat looks better. He has more energy and moves more easily. Really happy I found this food for him!
--------------------
Do not order online, all but 3 cans arrived dented. Buy directly at store. My cat loves the food so the food is good it just should not be delivered.
--------------------
you are one of the worse companies I have ever dealt with, 3 really bad experiences with your store and counting!
--------------------
My little girl loves this stuff. She only likes the texture of pate or very soupy food. She turns her nose up at anything else. I love it because Im giving her just enough at a time (Shes perpetually on a diet just like her mom). Also I dont have to refrigerate a can of leftovers which is good because shes not a fan of cold, congealed wet food (I just cut off the used cup). She currently prefers this one and I keep it on auto-ship. Sheba also makes a turkey version that she also loves.
--------------------
Only thing my calico cat will eat, love that it comes in individually sealed snap off containers!
--------------------
I love the half packs of chicken and turkey. My older cat loves them because of the pate form and it is a healthy brand option for wet food.
--------------------
My cats love it! I have been feeding my three year old cat sheba since we got him and now my new baby eats it too. :)
--------------------
My cats have always eaten anything that we give them, however I prefer to spend the extra few cents on each can to give them something that they prefer and has ingredients I can pronounce. We have been feeding them this brand of soft food for about 2.5 years now and they are 4 year old cats üêà
--------------------
My cat loves this food.
--------------------
My cat likes it and she is old and picky.
--------------------
When our old lady cat was diagnosed with diabetes, we had to begin monitoring her meal times so we could administer insulin after she ate. We decided to tempt her with wet food, and Sheba is her favorite! We like it too because it’s a lot less mess than the canned variety that we would have to portion out. Our other cat even licks the container clean!
--------------------
My cat eats the Sheba perfect portions and loves them! She used to eat dry kibble and it made her gain weight like crazy and caused her to get very sick! Our vet recommended wet food and we haven’t turned back.
--------------------
One of my cats will only eat the Pate and the other only the Perfect Portions in the chicken and turkey. Before I found Sheba they turned up their noses at everything. Thanks for the flavors and the variety in you products.
--------------------
My cat trouble loves this wet food and always tries to get me to feed it to him all the time :P
--------------------
This is the only cat food my two cats will not snub. Neither like a fish based cat food. Thank you for packaging this is chicken and turkey flavors only.
--------------------
My cats go nuts for this food! I love the convenience of having pre portioned meals for my kitties.
--------------------
Both of my cats love this wet food! The containers are the perfect size for a treat portion and are easy to open and scoop out of. I usually give my cats a better quality hard food every day, but split a container of this between them every few days as a treat along with some hard treats. They have come to know the sound of the bowls I use only for their wet food and come running when they hear me get them out of the cupboard. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a budget wet cat food as a treat. My cats don't have any digestive issues with this brand, either.
--------------------
My cats love this food! I love that there’s small portions so I’m not wasting the food. There’s just the right amount for one cat in each portion.
--------------------
Omg....my sweet little kitty cats absolutely love this food. They literally come up to me during the normal time of day for wet food and meow and Paw at me. It is so dang cute. #lovecats #kittyparade #cats #kittens #meow ❤❤❤
--------------------
This wet food is good for the cats digestive system and he seems to love the taste of it
--------------------
affordable and easy to find. sold at all stores. the only issue is the serving sizes aren’t too big so if you have a good eater it may not be enough
--------------------
One of my cats eat's nothing but Sheba, but only the pate... I have to give him a pill every other day and am able to mix it in and he eats it to the very last bite.. The bowl is so clean I tell him I might not need to wash it out... Of course I do tho..lol... When I saw the offer in Target I had to jump on it... I only wish that they could have had more in stock, as I would have bought more... I ordered 6 boxes, but I got an email that 1 of them could not have been had with no explanation if I could put it on backorder or not as I would have.. Great product as my cat would tell you if he could type
--------------------
Love this cat food! I give my cat hard food then as a treat, I give her the Sheba moist cat food. She LOVES it. I couldn’t be any happier considering that they give you a perfect portion. I would recommend.
--------------------
My cats only like Sheba Perfect Portionstm Cuts In Gravy Multipack Premium Cat Food 48 132 Oz Trays, I tried to feed them with a diferent brand of food but they refuse to eat any other.
--------------------
I like the convenience of the portions. There is no measuring like with bigger cans. These are a little more pricey then some of the other wet cat foods on the market. But, my fur babies seem to really like all the flavors.
--------------------
These are the perfect size for my picky cats! They are foil sealed and they have less waste than other foods. These worked well after my cat had his teeth pulled and was easy for him to eat.
--------------------
Full of juice and you can really see the chicken and beef! My cats absolutely adore both! There are cheaper wet food options on the market, but the quality of food you receive make it worth it!!
--------------------
Amy cat is very old and doesn’t like to eat dry food anymore, so we bought him these. He loves them and eats one a day. We leave dry cat food out for him all day and put one of these in the bowl every morning. Would recommend.
--------------------
I love the tray system, keeps everything together and I don’t have small packs of food floating around. I use these for my mynx and tabby cat
--------------------
My mom got my cat these for Christmas one year and he refuses to eat any other kind of wet food now. I love how they're individually portioned so I know he always gets a fresh meal and now the "end of the can" never goes to waste. He's 12lbs and gets on of these every morning for breakfast (and eats the whole thing).
--------------------
My cats love these Sheba perfect portions. They are such a great size. With larger cans I notice they waste and the food dries out prior to them finishing the can, not with these.
--------------------
Lately my cat has been getting sick due to her other wet food (friskys) but these Sheba Perfect portions have helped her not be sick. Makes it easier to give her half, and other not to bad!
--------------------
This is the only wet food my cat will eat and I love the portion control !
--------------------
My picky cats love this. It's great to have the variety pack with 3 options of flavors, but they like them all the same. This food has natural ingredients so I feel safe feeding it to my cats but it also doesn't break the bank. I'll keep buying this.
--------------------
My two cats split one every morning. It’s just the right size.
--------------------
I'll start with saying - my cats go CRAZY for Sheba, absolutely crazy. The second they hear the snap of the two perfectly portioned containers they go running to their bowls crying. They can be so picky about so many types of food, but I never have any trouble getting them to eat the Sheba (so long as it's the pate). Although they go through it much quicker than I'd hope, it's reasonably priced in comparison to other brands. However, I had to knock off a star because I've noticed more recently a lot of the individual containers are arriving moldy. I always order the 12 pks so they come well-protected, but the last case came with moldy, punctured containers. Sometimes even the unpunctured containers have spots of mold on them even though they are within the expiration date. While my cats LOVE this stuff, I may have to move to a different brand because of quality.
--------------------
My cats can't get enough of this stuff. One of my cats is very finicky and doesnt want to eat any other brand of wet food.
--------------------
My cat loves the Sheba Pate. It is on the expensive side and a bit difficult to open. But I buy what my cat likes. My order was delivered promptly.
--------------------
My cat used to love Sheba, either his taste has been refined or it’s nasty. Either way most of it has gone to waste.
--------------------
I was a little worried about this variety pack because in the past my cats hated the sheba turkey flavor, but they are loving it now. I don't mind the packaging, it is a bit hard to open but for me it's worth it because I need this portion size, my cats won't eat cold food out of the fridge so I can't use the bigger cans that I have lid up and use the next day..
--------------------
my cats love the food. But I will stop buying if there is no improvement in the opening of the product. It WILL run all over your hands and even squirt on your face and clothes and you open the pkgs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
My cats love Sheba wet cat food. I just wish the packages were slightly larger. I split the four servings with 5 cats. My cats prefer the pate over the cuts, but will eat either without any issues.
--------------------
Loyal purchaser for years but had to make the change due to the Perfect Portion packaging. Hard to open and not sure what type of plastic is used. Is the container recyclable? The food itself is of high quality.
--------------------
Love quality of food. Hate the packaging. Would prefer the cans
--------------------
My cats love the whitefish/tuna pate. I am looking for a different brand because the containers are horrible! Separating container leaves very sharp edges and removing the foil is difficult and often the juice leaks. Do you use super glue on it? I prefer the cans!
--------------------
This cat food seems acceptable to my cats but opening up a plastic tub and inevitably getting juice all over my hands and counter is not worth it, especially first thing in the morning. The cans were great but my cats eat another brand now that these horrid Perfect Portions are all you sell. I can't be opening a dozen of these things a day.
--------------------
Horrible packaging! Hard to open and has sharp edges. Please bring back the cans!
--------------------
My white Persian is a very particular eater. This is her special treat, it has to be the pate for her
--------------------
Recently made the decision to start feeding my cat some better quality foods, so I switched from canned friskies to Sheba. I will say I personally LOVE the packaging. I have little time in the morning to mess with opening a can and scooping it into a bowl, so being able to just rip the top seal off and go is awesome. I see a lot of people disapprove of the packaging so maybe having cans and the portion cups as options would be a good thing.
--------------------
Our cat has been having health issues, stomatitis, a mouth inflammation. He has been able to gain 14 oz. since being on this product. I never used the cans and have no issues with the plastic .
--------------------
Since the bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether in metal pop top cat food can lining is strongly implicated in feline hyperthyroidism, I LOVE the plastic cans. However, your own instructions to "Feed adult cats 3 portions per 5 pounds of body weight twice daily" says that these are not perfect portions for almost any cat. Needing to feed nine portions to our 16.1 pound cat, six portions to our 11.3 pound cat and three portions to our 5.2 pound cat equals a LOT of peeling. Doing it twice a day is ridiculous- and messy! After the cat's enthusiastic response to the food, we bought a second box. Unfortunately, your packaging is going to curtail our use. Please consider doing a 3 oz plastic can.
--------------------
Your pates have been the only wet food my cat hasn't turned his nose up at. However, at 10 lbs he need 6 of the "perfect portions". This is a huge waste of packaging (which is not nearly as recyclable as metal) and means there's 6 opportunities to be hit by gravy every day. Please bring back the cans!
--------------------
I had a horrible time trying to open the new packaging. They are too difficult to open. Please bring back the 3 oz cans. They are the perfect portion size, are easy to open and store. My cat loves the food and pushes me out of the way to get to it. I purchased another brand yesterday in the 3 oz cans and will see if she likes it. I don't want to switch but will for the convenience of the cans.
--------------------
Why are you phasing out the cans...Why?? They are so much more convenient and are very popular, unlike they asinine plastic "perfect portions". Please bring back the cans....asap! I would recommend yes for the food, no for the packaging.
--------------------
I have a very picky cat. He will ONLY eat sheba chunks. But, he will not eat the chunks when it comes out of the plastic containers. I have tried everything, including saving old cans and putting the food from the plastic containers in the cans, but he will not eat it. Im now having a hard time trying to find the cans. Please bring the cans backs. The perfect portion plastic containers are awful.
--------------------
I am lucky in that I have three cats and none of them are terribly picky. All three love pretty much every flavor of Sheba. I'm hoping they'll like something else too because opening so many packages every day of the stupid perfect portions is driving me insane. The package is recyclable but the napkins I use cleaning my counters every time when the package inevitably explodes are not. Time for a new brand I guess.... Bring back cans!
--------------------
Really missing the 3 oz cans. The foil on the perfect portions is hard to open, and as a result, I get the stinky sauce all over my hands almost every time. This is so frustrating that I am tempted to just donate what I have left over to a shelter. In addition, there is less product in 2 perfect portions than in the 3 oz can, and it costs more. Will probably look for a new canned brand, though my kitty likes the taste of these.
--------------------
I loved the cans for my two cats. It is a great cat food with no additives and meat was the first ingredient; however, I cannot stand the re-marketing with the smaller, plastic "perfect portion" containers because it's more expensive and less recyclable (I can recycle the entire cans but cannot recycle the foil on these new portioned packs). I cannot find the cans now anywhere!
--------------------
My cats are satisfied with the pate in the small cans. They were convenient and affordable. Why are they unavailable? It makes no sense to us consumers. Please explain!
--------------------
My cat will only eat the chicken pate entree. I use to buy them by the case and tried to buy a case to today only to find out the cans are discontinued!! I'm very angry that you stop making them. Why not just charge more if you are losing money. I do not like their replacement. Pleasae bring back the small 3oz cans!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Perfect for my cat because she will not eat leftovers, must be fresh every time. I have to agree the package is a little difficult to use but to be able to open a fresh portion and not wasting food is worth it to me.! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Both my kitty and I love this product. The top is wonderful....keeps it fresh! I have tried the foil double half-moon servings and my baby does not like it as well. She also will not eat the "cuts" and I do not know why! I certainly hope you bring back the cans....would not care if you increased the price.
--------------------
My cats love the food, even my 21 year old, my biggest problem is with the packaging. My hands are stiff and lack strength because of some neck surgery. So I have already cut my fingers several times on the foil. Unless you do some changes I may have to change brands.
--------------------
My cat, Ramsey, has a sensitive system. Rich food upsets his bowels. He gets one of these every other day as a treat, and it doesn't bother his GI tract. He is happy that he still gets some wet food and I'm happy that he isn't sick. Great idea!!!
--------------------
I liked Sheba because of the nutrition facts, packaging and size of the portions containers. It wasn't just a generic cheap brand. I wanted my cats to have better ingredients. I got the portion sizes because it's easier to manage feeding multiple cats. All of my 3 cats have very shinny and soft coats.
--------------------
My cat Loves the Pâtés she will not eat anything else!!! She like her food a little warm and the plastic containers makes it so easy to warm up. The Perfect Portions are a great size she always finishes so there is no waste.
--------------------
I think there must be a strong Sheba demand out there because I can't find enough to restock with consistency. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
When I was unable to find the cans of Sheba pate in my area is was bummed out because the Perfect Portions are more expensive and saddened and frustrated because neither the foil nor the plastic is recyclable in my ares, but I went ahead and bought a box of the Perfect Portions because my cats love it and it does not contain any of the carbohydrate-rich ingredients that almost every cat food seems to be using these days. When I went to feed my cats today, I tried to open the little package and had to readjust my grip 3 times before I could get the foil to start to peel, and then immediately I had the liquid all over my hands. At that point I had to wash and dry them before I could try peeling the foil off again, because they were slippery. As soon as I touched the package again, more juices! I had to get a paper towel and clean off the end of the foil before I could successfully grip it again. Opening the second package to feed my other cat was even worse because by that time my hands hurt and I was ready to throw the packet against the wall. I absolutely HATE this new packaging. I would give it negative stars if I could. If I am not able to find the cans again, I will be buying Nutro at 2 1/2 time the price in the future.
--------------------
Our little rescued girl lost all but three teeth, this soft food works great for her. She loves the turkey Pate and chicken.
--------------------
My cat is 16 years old and fussy . She enjoys seba pate turkey and chicken. I like perfect portions so I can give her one of one and one ot the other.
--------------------
My cat loves Sheba pate and these are convenient and just the right size for 1-2 servings for her.
--------------------
This is the only food my cat will eat!
--------------------
They love this food and I love the easy portions. No more open cans!
--------------------
Quality cat food and my cat really likes it. Its made from real salmon and has no chicken by products or corn or preservatives.
--------------------
My favorite homeless cat Jazmond really dislikes fish and is seriously picky about wet cat food.  Decided to give this a try for him, especially since I did not have to buy a big box and then find out he did not like.  On the contrary, he really ate this voraciously and I am ordering now on a regular basis. Do wish it was not so pricey however, as this limits the amount I can buy!!
--------------------
Not the babies favorite but mamma and pappa love the nutrition and value
--------------------
Kitties love this... I can camouflage the flavor of their supplements in this.. We also mix their Blue Buffalo  grain free food in it & everything goes down easy!
--------------------
old cat loves it...………….
--------------------
Quick delivery, great price. All my cat will eat, exactly what I ordered!
--------------------
My Callie is in love and not having issues with vomiting this after eating. She has been eating the chicken pate for about 2 months.
--------------------
All my cat has to hear is the package being broken in half and she comes running and begging
--------------------
My cats generally love sheba but this time I purchased and the tops of half the box are swollen out like they've gone bad. Im trying to find out if these are still good or if I should throw away. Thanks
--------------------
Our cats love this wet food. They hear the kid coming off the container and they are ready for their dinner!
--------------------
This food is the best. My cat can't wait for dinner time. She yowls until she gets her Sheba. She is a happy cat which makes me a happy owner.
--------------------
My kitten loves this food and I love how perfectly portioned it is! I don’t have to deal with lots of uneaten food or leftover cat food in a can-which my husband finds gross. I feel like it’s a good price too!
--------------------
I decided to try this for my cat with feline leukemia as she was losing teeth and needed soft food, and she loved it. She licks the plate clean.
--------------------
A little expensive but my cat turns up her nose at the rest of the cat food since purchasing this. I give her on of the portions a day along with dry cat food. I will continue to purchase
--------------------
My cat is a very picking eater and getting him to try anything can be very difficult, but as soon as I introduced this to him, he loved it! Few months later and he still does.
--------------------
I would give this 5 stars if the portion sizes were a bit bigger. My cat seems to like these mostly she isn’t picky. The portions and bites are super small compared to other portioned wet food I’ve bought. But overall good for the price.
--------------------
I would refer Sheba to anyone.
--------------------
My cat freaking loves these. She BEGS for them all day long lol. If I am in the kitchen and I ask her if she wants a "sheba sheba" she comes running into the kitchen like a cat on cocaine lmao. Your cat will LOOOOVE this!!!
--------------------
My dad had been feeding me Fancy Feast products after adopting me because that’s what I was used to. He went on a website that breaks down ingredients and reviews all different cat foods. His research tells him that wet food is better than dry so I don’t get the hydrated so he feeds me three packs of these a day and a quarter cup of dry food at night so I don’t wake him up if I’m hungry. The 3 ounce Fancy Feast are used to eat was OK but I got sick of it after a while and didn’t eat at all. It went to waste. Even though the Sheba cost a little bit more, dad says I’m worth it, and I sure don’t waste any. I absolutely love this stuff! I think all cats should eat Sheba. I have to go now it’s almost dinner time. If you want to see how happy I am after eating this you can visit my Instagram page @BodhiTheEnlightenedCat - I hope this helps you.
--------------------
My cat loves this food and Target is the best place to find it, with the best prices.
--------------------
My cats love this food, right when they hear the click of them separating they come running, it’s a healthy and well portioned choice of food I highly recommend! Although they have been hard to find they are amazing for my cats!
--------------------
My cats loveee the gravy. The portions are perfect for indoor cats, which is great because you’re not throwing away the excess.
--------------------
One of my cats absolutely loved this!!! The other one is very picky and was not a fan. Definitely will keep it for my one cat.
--------------------
My cat loves loves these! I only get him these and the other cuts from this line and fancy feast and he loves them. When he hears me break one off he runs to me because he knows his getting his favorite food. I highly recommend it for your cats.
--------------------
Love this stuff and my cat does too! We have so many flavors so he never gets bored and I can always be sure that he's eating good and not eating too much.
--------------------
My cat loves this food! She comes running to her food bowl every time I open a side of these! I don’t even have to add her food topper to get her to eat!
--------------------
I have used this food for a while and my cats love it.. however I opened one to give to my kitten the other day and there was a big dead fly sitting on top within the food. I understand this is for animals, but I find this unacceptable. I am now nervous that there are bugs mixed in that I do not immediately see. Pretty disappointing for a brand I’ve loved for years. I am trying to attach a photo but it keeps erroring out.
--------------------
They like only fish flavors. My cats are very picky eaters. They mostly get the cuts in gravy, but some times we switch it to the patte
--------------------
My cat is super picky when it comes to his food, he is a grey nebelung named Rayleigh. ❤️ he usually eats abound food but I recently bought this to try and he loves it!!! He actually devours it. I like it because it's not as much food as the bigger pouches so he always eats it all. I'm not throwing some away bc he won't finish.
--------------------
My cat loves these. I love the fact that they come in perfect portions. I use them as a topper for his dry food. The price for them is amazing too. All around great product.
--------------------
My cat enjoys this and I enjoy that I don’t waste half a can when he needs his wet food.
--------------------
My cats all time favorite flavor! They go nuts and having the portions makes it easy to feed them both. The removal of the lid being easier would be nice though
--------------------
My cats love this. I have 5, so 3 prefer cuts, the other 2 prefer pate but this flavor is always a hit with them.
--------------------
My cat cannot get enough of the Sheba Perfect Portions, but it has to be the "cuts" style and not "pate". When 5:00 PM rolls around each day, he is very vocal that it is time for his serving of "wet food" for the day. I like the "cuts" style because it seems easier for the cats to eat since it is already "cut" up. There also seems to be more gravy/juices with the cuts, so my cat seems to really enjoy that. When you buy these at the store, they come in 2-serving packs (individually sealed). I feed my cat one serving per day (in addition to his dry food), which is more than enough to satisfy that craving he gets. Target regularly has great sales on Sheba products as well, so looking for Cartwheel deals can save some money! Cannot recommend this cat food enough!
--------------------
My fur kid loves this brand so I try to give him a variety of flavors. Just find it unfortunate that there’s a cartwheel offer on Sheba during this period which is only applicable up to a limit to 4 per transaction and this item is not available in a multipack only individual pack.
--------------------
This product is great! It's the perfect serving size for my cats, even though they are all different sizes. It makes a nice treat! I wouldn't change anything about this product! My cats love these and they make for easy and quick feedings! I would definitely recommend this!
--------------------
My cat loves this stuff! It’s her favorite snack! She’s definitely a Sheba girl! It’s not expensive!
--------------------
My cat loves this. Every time I give her some she licks the plate clean. Every morning she will meow until I give it to her. She begs for it at night too lol
--------------------
My cat loves sheba food in gravy. The only one he does not like is the turkey. The portions are good sized and I feel like they leave him feeling full for a long period of time.
--------------------
The cuts are for sure a favorite, more juice than the paté, and the tuna seems to be a Kitty favorite. Its been staple with our cat for a while. The packs are a bit hard to open sometimes. and juice gets left behind, but the portions and the "flavor" are worth it!
--------------------
These portions are just right for our cat. After trying many other wet foods, she would barely eat them, then when we tried this brand she loved them. She will wake up my husband for breakfast at 6 am, without fail. We use 2 daily then supplement with a grain free dry food.
--------------------
Sheba Perfect Portionstm Cuts In Gravy Signature Tuna Entree Cat Food 2 13 Oz Cups my cat loves and I like the idea of the perfect portions because I feed him once in the morning and once in the evening. But my cat is a large breed cat so the serving size was just too small. But I would absolutely recommend this to anybody with a normal sized cat. Makes it very convenient and easy to serve
--------------------
Perfect portions for small cats, or cats who need to be on a restricted diet due to weight.
--------------------
One of my cats favorite flavors! He loves pate and especially the tuna flavor. I have a korat
--------------------
My fur babies are inside which means their exercise is limited. I started to notice that they were getting kind of saggy and... well, fat. As a cat mom the last thing I want is them to be unhealthy. So, i switched frim our old wet cat food to Sheba perfect portions about a month ago and I am happy to say those little kitty bellies arent as saggy anymore! They love the flavor and there is not over feeding.
--------------------
My kitties love the Sheba PP.  I do too. They really are perfect portions.  They also smell really good for cat food.  They are so appealing I would even eat them!! Lol.
--------------------
my cat will not eat any food other than the Sheba cuts and she seems to like this flavor, so will be buying more if she continues to eat
--------------------
This is literally the only food my cat eats anymore. He’s happy when he hears it crack to be opened. The small portions make it easier so he doesn’t gain a crazy amount of weight. I highly recommend to other owners.
--------------------
my cat loved it, but that may have been the newness of it.  I will definitely try it again.  And, I liked it because it wasn't as stinky as I was imagining it would be.
--------------------
My cat loves this food. Target can’t keep it on the shelves so seems like other cats like it too!
--------------------
The gravy cuts are great for my cats they honestly seem to love the gravy more than anything
--------------------
The cats ALL love this one. Usually when i feed them other foods, they will get sick or have stomach issues. When i give them this brand, there’s no tummy problems whatsoever.
--------------------
My cat eats this really well and he’s a picky eater. Good stuff for cat.
--------------------
My cat will eat almost all the salmon flavors. I could only get 1 this order but will watch for more to be available as this is one of his most favorite.
--------------------
My Ileana likes this okay (and she's a finicky eater); but she would love it all the more if they were a bit more generous with the gravy (very little in it).
--------------------
As my cat ages she gets more picky about food. It never fails when she "loves" something and I buy a box of the stuff, she won't eat it. Sigh. I grabbed Sheba Salmon to try and she really enjoys the food. I just wish it didn't have so much chicken in it or poultry. The first ingredient listed is chicken in the Salmon Entree, I'm not happy about that. My senior gal (18 yrs old) who passed away a few months ago had an allergy to chicken after eating it for years. Now I don't like giving my one senior a lot of chicken. For now because she will eat it I'll continue to buy Sheba, until she won't.
--------------------
My cat LOVES this food, he is always wanting more! He is a big fan! #puurrfect. # #mycatlovestoeat....
--------------------
I have one cat that is very picky, I've bought every cat food in the store. This is the only food she will eat. Perfect size and no need to keep leftovers in the fridge like other larger cans.
--------------------
My cats love this. They gobble it all up. And I love that I don’t have to touch anything or use a utensil to scoop it out or put any leftovers in the people fridge.
--------------------
I have tried so many brands my cats only like the sheba. I give them dry food on the side. The only wet food is sheba my cats like this favor.
--------------------
My cat loves these. She meows constantly when she sees the package, until I set her dish down! Perfect serving size too!
--------------------
My cat loves these. She meows constantly when she sees the package, until I set her dish down! Perfect serving size too!
--------------------
Gives my cat what he needs without being too much on this cat mama's wallet! He really enjoys it and along with his dry food this occasional wet food is perfect to balance his diet. I can be sure the ingredients are good and good for him and that will always keep me a customer!
--------------------
My cat loves canned food but the regular sized food is just to much. This is the perfect size and comes in a variety of flavors. My cat will not eat any other now.
--------------------
My kitties love this and all the other seafood cuts! Its perfect cause my 2 year old cant eat too much at once so the sizes are perfect!
--------------------
My cat just loves Sheba Perfect Portions. After months and months of trying all kinds of wet food this is the only one he will eat all of the package. The portion sizes are just perfect!
--------------------
My cat loves this flavor compared to any other. She is very particular and she loves this. The packaging half and half also helps to serve as needed. And she never had any issue with digestion. I highly recommend this
--------------------
My cats only eat this brand
--------------------
So my cats love this food especially this flavor (turkey cuts). They are super finicky - only cats I know that turn their noses up at anything fish flavored. Bizarre that they are both that way (not litter mates). I like that this food is easy to open and preportioned BUT the portions are a bit small. Both of my cats want/need more than this amount - I end up using 3 portions split between them for each meal. Also, the easy open is nice BUT tends to make a mess. I do like that I can rinse them easily and drop in the recycling bin. That said, I don't know that this plastic is coded for recycling but I'm hoping it is. The other reason I am giving 3 stars is because they sell some single flavors in multi packs but not this one. You have to buy it with chicken flavor or something. Annoying since my cats only like this flavor. Buying these individually when I am using 3 packs a day (for 2 cats) gets expensive.
--------------------
My cats will go crazy soon as they hear the "snap" of the perfect portions. They love love love them, and I love that 1 thing can split into two and be perfect portion for each cat.
--------------------
This is one of the few cat foods my kitty's sensitive stomach can handle. However, her mom, who has arthritis in her fingers, struggles with opening the little containers. I would much prefer regular cans. Since my cat can't handle dry food, I have to open many cans of Sheba each day. Therefore, I'm always looking for other brands with conventional cans.
--------------------
I have been feeding my cats the tuna perfect portions cuts for 2 years. I bought some today at my local target store. When I opened the pack tonight to feed Lacy and Bella dinner the food was bad. The worst smell and it was a runny brown and green liquid. I have never smelled anything so bad in my life. I threw it out but the smell still lingers in my home.
--------------------
I am a foster for 2 kittens. Both were very malnourished when they were rescued. Neither could digest dry food. I tried your brand and they love it!!! They have both gained weight and are healthy!! Thank you!!
--------------------
My cats loved this Sheeba Perfect Portions, especially the gravy in it. A great buy and will buy again
--------------------
my cats can only eat this wet food with out getting sick. i have tried other wet foods that i had coupons for an they both was getting sick. from the most expensive to the cheapest. also wish more stores would carry all the flavors they like, we go to 2 different stores
--------------------
I was trying to find a wet cat food that my cats would actually eat, due to some health issues one has. Sheba cuts in gravy is the only wet cat food they will eat.
--------------------
My cat likes these but isn’t completely wild about the cuts, preferred the pates. But the packaging is still nice and the potions are the perfect size.
--------------------
Hi! My cats are both really enjoying Sheba, and I am glad to feed it to them, however, it is becoming increasingly hard to open the tiny packages . For people with arthritis, it's very hard to open them. The cans were already hard to open, and I have to use something to pry under the tab, but now, it's even harder to pull back the foil wrappers, on an even tinier package. Is it possible to add a better pull feature to the wrapper or even some kind of zip feature in the foil, that would make it easier? I, and I'm sure MANY other cat parents would really appreciate it!
--------------------
My elderly cat loves this stuff, but the foil lids have cut into my thumb a few times and the gravy squirts everywhere when you open them. Please, I beg you, switch back to cans, or something. As soon as I find a replacement my cat likes I won’t be buying Sheba again.
--------------------
I give my cat Sheba at night. He loves them, this is one of his favorites!
--------------------
My cat who is a rescue cat is about 3 years old.She loves all sheba products,I give her one Sheba product every day along side her dry food.
--------------------
My girl only likes this wet food. This brand, this flavor. This is HER treat after the 5 eat their dry food (she's a thin active girl). Easy to open contianers without making a gravy mess. Relatively inexpensive. Mew. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
Pumpkin aka Punky aka Punk. Was given to me by a friend about 9 months ago and he was about a yr old. He is my emotional support animal. But really hes my best friend, my baby or whatever type comfort I need. Hes a big stong boy! At first I gave him the dry food (meow mix) which was given to me with him. He has an "open constant feeder". Hes indoors. I started buying the perfect portions as a daily treat for him. One portion and then his dry food always there for him. The past 2 months he acts like he is not happy with whats always there in his bowl. He meows at me begging for the perfect portions all day long! Yet he has the dry food always available. Ive given all types dry food. Last bag was Iams. After the iams for weight control (he got up to about 20 lbs) he lost weight. Was dewormed and now he wants tge perfect portions all day. I live giving them to him! I feel like a good mom! They are actually pieces of meat with gravy. It being small is great because the can stuff stinks! Then you have to refrigerate part of it. I dont want to feed my baby Something that gags me to open! Hes my bestfriend my child my heart! He should have the perfect portions real meat and gravy always. I am on disabilty and its not affordable enough for me to give him more than one a day. According to feeding instructions he would need at least 6 of those a day! Its hard for me to afford to give him the one along with dry food. He loves it so much and past two months has driven me nuts meowing begging for it all day and waking me at night. I know his "I want food" type meow/sound. He loves this stuff. He prefers and ask for it eventhough hes had expensive dry cat food out at all times! Im trying to figure out a way to afford to give him just this. Hes unhappy and constant meows for it. This stuff is that great that my cat "asks and begs" for it! Eventhough he has other food 24/7. Meow Meow Meow for his meat treat as I call it. Ignoring the always available dry food of all different brands from mid grade to expensive. You guys have spoiled my kitty! I love how you have them im small portions so no need to refrigerate any part. The best part for me are the portions! My Punky loves your product! I wish I could afford to only feed him that. He deserves it. So great job guys! If you could do better pricing that would be great. Its great but not affordable to me. May God make a way for it to be possible to produce at lower cost without sacrifice of its perfection that it already has!
--------------------
My 13 year old cat has thyroid problems and is getting very picky as she ages. She is hooked on this and turns her nose up to anything else.
--------------------
My cat Vinny is about 5 years old. Had to take him to the vet for issues with throwing up food. It seems that he has a sensitive stomach. I chose to feed him grain-free food. I bought Blue Buffalo Sensitive Stomach food and he kept vomiting the portions that I would give him. I used perfect portions for the past 6 months and my cat has not vomited once. I feed him a portion every couple of hours. He loves the food, but the calculations on feeding are not very buyer friendly. First, take my cat, a domestic shorthair that weighs about 10lbs, so that's 6 portions twice a day. So that's 6 of those packages a day. So, if you buy the 12 pack that's like 2 days of food if your cat weighs 10 lbs. This food sounds like a snack in between the solid food you give your cat. It should be called perfect portions SNACK for your cat. So if your cat can't handle dry food, you might as well save your money and not get this product and get something else. This food should be the addition to your cat's diet not the only thing he eats or else you'll be spending a LOT of money. Do I recommend this product? Yes and No. Yes, if you feed your cat mostly dry food. No, if you feed your cat only wet food.
--------------------
My cat likes the food, but the packaging is too hard to open. Will have to stop buying this product. Also, need more variety.
--------------------
I open up the package for my cat to eat and this moldy slime came out. The odor was HORRIBLE! Sheba should be ashamed of themselves for making putrid food like this!
--------------------
My main coon is a picky eater. She eats very little wet food. She loves the roasted chicken and turkey.She has never finished wet and food now she does. My only complaint is the packaging design the cat model looks a little scary and dark.
--------------------
My senior cats loves it,and the portion is good for him BUT it's almost not worth getting because it is so annoying opening it and getting splashed with juices! Ugh! Everytime...please please fix the packaging.
--------------------
Sheba cuts are the only food my cat will eat. I am so disappointed in these perfect portions. I miss the cans, more food for a cheaper price. Thank goodness she will eat dry food too, it’s expensive to buy these to keep her fed. I’ve tried other brands but of course she won’t eat them. Frustrating, expensive, messy to open. Not sure what they were thinking when they changed. I am stuck buying these for now!
--------------------
I use these as treats twice a day to supplement their dry food. I love being able to feed small portions without having lots of food waste from larger cans. The sizing is perfect for my small eaters who enjoy having something special for breakfast time and "oh she's home!!!" time. I agree the pull tops are very messy but I don't think cans would be better and I know I don't like the sharp metal waste of cans. I just open the portions facing the bowl then wash my hands. Gravy is messy no matter how it's packaged but the cats love that part so it's a non-issue for me. After reading the "feeding Instructions" tab though I am very confused by what it says..." Each day, feed adult cats 3 portions per 5 pounds of body weight twice daily"... does that mean my 10 lb cat should eat 12 of these per day? Why is a portion 3 and not 1???? The cost of 12 per day would be ridiculous, and that would be for the smallest of my cats who range from 10 to 20lbs. Glad I only use this as a supplement.
--------------------
Moo ( yes my cats name) and my other kitty used to eat 9 lives canned, then i moved and could only have one kitty, and she eouldnt touch anything so i bought this and she loves it and a couple other flavors!! but mostly this one
--------------------
I inherited a stray a little over 2 years ago. At first he would eat anything, but when I started feeding Sammy any canned food with gravy, he began to snub any pate style food. Then, I found out Sammy is allergic to either wheat gluten or soy which is very prevalent in "with gravy" cat food. Now with Sheba, Sammy's skin is back to normal and he has his favorite style food. Happy cat, happy owner.
--------------------
I have to chop up the "cuts" very small to trick her into eating any of this. But she loves it & I spoil her rotten to begin with. In talking to other "fur" mommies in the pet food aisle, they say the same thing.
--------------------
I started buying this food because of the portions, my cat loves this food! I ended up switching to a different type of wet food and come to find out my cat is allergic to grains. So I switched back because she didn’t have the reaction like the other food gave her. I love that this food is grain free! Infact I had no idea it was until I looked up grain free wet food. I will always buy this for my cats! There’s never a drop left once they are done eating!
--------------------
My cats LOVE Sheba. It is all they would eat, but I really wish they would bring back the Cuts with Gravy in the cans. Having multiple cats, it is just too expensive to buy all the perfect portions.
--------------------
Sheba must have the best wet food because my cat will only eat this brand. She eats all flavors from their perfect portions wet food, but she eats every drop of this flavor
--------------------
Our cats gobble this stuff up. My only gripe is that the packaging is annoyingly small at only 32 calories per serving. Opening 6 portions per day (which is what our cats would need) is annoying and wasteful. Until there are regular sized cans, this will unfortunately be a treat rather than regular food.
--------------------
My 18 year old geriatric cat is eating the Roasted Chicken cuts. It's the only thing in weeks that he's eaten all of when fed. We are rotating foods constantly trying to find things our picky cats will eat. This one has lost most of his teeth and lost a lot of weight so we will feed him anything he will eat. Hope he continues to eat it because it's worrisome when he refuses his food!
--------------------
but I hate the perfect portions packaging. I also think the moisture content is a bit high, but she is eating it. Its been an adventure switching from dry to wet, Still trying different brands due to the packaging. thanx Sheba for helping Dilly switch.
--------------------
The food is great. the cat wont eat anything else. Howevre my wife and I are elderly with arthritis and struggle trying to open them. we finally resort to a knife. can you change the packaging in the future Thanks
--------------------
Our cat Bobbie is definitely a Sheba lover. She loves roasted chicken
--------------------
The instructions on the pate and the cuts are exactly the same despite a 13kcal difference per portion (pate is rated at 45kcal cuts are at 32kcal). Due to the packaging and the expectations for half portions to carry the same amount of kcal as a half a 3 oz can of food regardless of texture type has led my cat to lose weight on this food. The quantity of packages I'd need to feed her of Sheba to equate to a kcal in a standard 2.5 cans of wet food (225 kcal) per day is untenable at 7+ portions of 32kcal Sheba portions. She does good to get 3 portions down in a sitting. Her tummy just isn't that big! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
--------------------
The Perfect Portions are TWICE the price of the old 3 oz cans, DOUBLE the wasteful packaging, and NOT the same formula like we are being led to believe.

My cat fiesta has problems with her thyroid and shes over 15. She is hungry yet she wasnt eating...I brought this home to see if this would be to her liking and so far she goes through 3 packs a day...the other cats are unhappy because she isnt leaving them anything anymore...yay
--------------------
My 13 year olds favorite flavor of the blue buffalo wet cat food! Will continue to purchase
--------------------
very heathy and my cats ate it right up.
--------------------
Our older rescues (over 20 yrs) have generally been picky picky picky...until I started 'graduating' them up the scale of Buffalo products, and even then they didn't care for most of the more exotic flavors...after years of who knows what food that makes sense..  but they LOVE this one!!! Literally gobble it up - so fancy isn't always the answer - and richness has to be gradual..but it's worth it so see them enjoy eating!!
--------------------
Cats didn't eat it. What is the point of buying it if the cats won't eat it.
--------------------
My cat is older and a picky eater, she loves this food
--------------------
I like the nutritional value and that it doesn't smell bad, but the cats are not impressed. If l leave the dishes out all day, they will eventually eat it all up, but I supplement with the Blue Buffalo cat kibble, and their coats are excellent and their energy level incredible. So I'm sticking with it.
--------------------
My cat loves this wet food! We give her about a quarter of a portion as a treat after we clean her eyes and shes always ready for more! The smell is fishy, but that doesnt stop her from eating until shes licked the plate clean!
--------------------
All my flame point Siamese cat eats is Sheba pate single portions
--------------------
My cat has had a sore mouth for a year, gingivitis,. It has almost impossible to find foods she could eat. There were days she didn’t eat at all. I finally found Sheba cat food, it says it’s delicate. I first gave her the salmon pate. It was very soft and she ate it so fast I thought she had left with out eating it. She at three servings quickly, and ate three more during the rest of the day. Sine that day she has been eating five servings each day. She calls to me until I feed her. The other brands I have tried were gritty and hurt her mouth. Your food, all flavors have been a life savior. I am extremely grateful for your food. Thank you.
--------------------
Both my cats love the Sheba Perfect Portions! I love that I can split the packet for the both of them to share. Its the right amount of wet food for them. They still eat their dry food as well.
--------------------
My cat only loves Sheba. And only the tuna and the salmon ones. I tried to give her another brand the other day and she flipped her dish over and walked away! Lol I died laughing. But once mama came to the rescue with her Sheba she was so happy! My baby is a Sheba kitty for sure!
--------------------
I love the Sheba Perfect Portions wet food containers, because they easily split in half, and I feed one portion to each of my cats. They have tried a lot of the different varieties of the perfect portions pate and cut flavors, and have loved every one they have eaten, but I buy this multipack, because it is easier to ring up at check out :)
--------------------
I bought this multipack thinking it would last my kitten a while. She loves it so much, it only lasted about five days. I don't mind, I'm just glad she likes it.
--------------------
I absolutely hate the perfect portions packs. Every time I feed the cat I get stinky cat food juice all over my hands. Another thing is that they are totally ripping us off these days to pay for this terrible tiny packaging, I assume. I do not buy this product anymore since the packaging was changed. However I did recently because they were out of my sheba replacement cat food I have used since they switched the portion size and packaging. Bring back the cans and I will buy it again. You are fooling anyone with this product change. Cat food juice is so gross, seriously every single time!
--------------------
My cats love this food so much, the second i walk in the door from work, they both run to the pantry for their wet food. I would say they both scarf it down in about 60 seconds flat and the portion size is perfect so i don’t feel like I’m giving them too much and i don’t have to worry about keeping half empty containers in the fridge
--------------------
My young cat stopped eating the food she was enjoying since she was a kitten. We liked that these were packed in small portions, so tried the. She loooooves them! She does not leave a drop!
--------------------
StartEd her on it after she refused to eat 9 lives. They gobble it down.
--------------------
My cat loves this food and clearly it’s not the cheapest but we love her so her choice. However I bought the largest box of this I could find I believe 24 packs, after about 3 the rest literally smelled like something dead. Cat food doesn’t smell pleasant as it is so you know this was horrible. I’m just glad I didn’t feed it to her. So disappointed
--------------------
I have a picky cat. I have bought her everything between fancy feast and store brand cat food. She only licks the juice then I waste so much money on trying to find her something she will actually eat!! Until I found Sheba. The Sheba patte is her absolute favorite and this pack is good because they are the perfect size for a small cat (like mine) and they have a variety of flavors. Thank GOD for Sheba for keeping my picky baby happy and fat!
--------------------
Dry food almost killed our cat. Our vet suggested wet food like these perfect portions and she’s as healthy as ever!
--------------------
Been buying it a couple months. My very sensitive cat is rarely throwing up now.
--------------------
i have a 6 week old kitten who is very picky with food and has been since birth. i had to purchase a few brands of wet cat food and this one seems to be the one he favors the most. he'll even lick the container after he finishes eating a serving
--------------------
The sheba seafood selections are the ONLY wet cat food our Thomas will eat and boy does he love them. He would eat himself sick if he had opposable thumbs lol. Thank you providing us with something we can make our Thomas very happy!
--------------------
My cat is super picky, he’ll like one food for a week then the next week he won’t even look at it. He has been pretty consistent with liking this food though! He prefers the whitefish flavor over the salmon but he does eat both. He likes the tender cuts version as well. I do like that it’s portioned out for you, but from an environment standpoint it’s wasteful to have all the white plastic cups that it comes in. They’re #6 plastic which I don’t think can be recycled, or at least not in my area.
--------------------
My cat refuses to eat any other food but this one. And he would rather eat tuna than chicken. Yes he's obviously spoiled, but very soon after he started eating Sheba, his coat became just gorgeous. It's shinier, softer and fuller. We thought it was beautiful before, but now it's clearly so much healthier. And so he gets what he wants anyway
--------------------
This product is absolutely amazing the very best wet cat food on the market. Our cat is roughly medium sized snd since shes a rescue we are unsure of breed and age. This food blew all others out of the way, she is so excited when she see me starting to open up the box. She tries her hardest to pull it to her faster. I do wish though I could find a larger box set, but other than that its perfect. Our Isabella (cat) is uour spokeskitty.
--------------------
i have 2 cats that LOVE this and I have 2 that LOVE the turkey and chicken pate
--------------------
I bought this for the past 4 months and my cat really love it.
--------------------
My 3 cats love Sheba. The portions are perfectly sized.
--------------------
One of our two cats is a fussy eater. We have tried so many different brands, flavors and types and have finally found something our little "fuss box" actually loves to eat! We have tried several Sheba Perfect Portions flavors now and every one is a hit! Before Sheba, she would sniff, walk away and do something naughty to express her dislike. Now she comes running when she hears the sound of the tray being opened! Perfect portion size is great so we don't over or under-serve the kitties. Happy cats and happy humans at our house at meal times now.
--------------------
This is the only wet cat food my kittens can eat without throwing up. Every other brand they can't handle. There's a lot of d different flavors to choose from too, as well as pate and shreds. My kittens both really enjoy this food. Great buy, would recommend.
--------------------
If you haven't already you must buy this for your kittens/cats! I don't buy any other brand! My 3 cats ages 2-12 absolutely love the pate seafood pack! Every single time I open one they come running and meowing so loud! When they're finished they lay in there beds with their full belly's purring away until they fall asleep.
--------------------
These are great they come in portions. Just the right amount for my little kitty. Price is excellent
--------------------
The fact that they are separate portions are super easy to not overfeed and easy to put into her cat bowl. My cat loves this food but it would be nice if there were more “variety” boxes. I would recommend this is cat owners have not much time to separate cans and this is much more efficient . Cat enjoys it so cat mom is happy !
--------------------
This is the only wet food my cat will eat! He’s never satisfied with just one, even though we supplement with dry food.
--------------------
I love these things! They’re just the right size to split up and top off the meals of the kitty’s bowls. I also love that the come in sets of different variations, that way I can give them something different every now and again. They’re a decent price and my cats go nuts over them!
--------------------
Our cats love these perfect portions. I love that they come in the perfect serving size for two cats.
--------------------
Picky kitty loves these. It’s great because they are smaller portions so there is little risk of him leaving some behind and it drying out and getting pitched. Opening them tends to get a little messy with gravy splashing out every single time (think those little creamer containers that spurt out when you peel the top). Older cats need more moisture in their diets and this was an easy transition from years of Putin’s cat chow that was starting to cause allergic reactions. Switched to Sheba and haven’t caught him itching since.
--------------------
as cat food goes, my cat likes this one pretty much and she is picky.
--------------------
My fur babies seem to really enjoy all the flavors in Sheba’s multipack. I like the convenience of the pre-measured servings. It is less hassle than the big cans that other brands have. They are easy to rinse and throw in recycling.
--------------------
My two cats love this product. This is the only wet food that doesn’t make my older cat sick.
--------------------
My little boy Sabrina just loooovvveeeddd this as soon as the peal came off he was already reaching for it. You know you're cat really like something thing when he licks the little can all around the room
--------------------
My cat enjoys this food but i have to switch up the flavors or else she gets bored. This packaging makes it easy for my 5 year old to feed the cat.
--------------------
Convenient snack packs for the cats. They enjoy this brand.
--------------------
We got these for our 20 year old kitty who needed to gain weight. She ADORES the pate style and eagerly begs for her feeding time! (We know when she's ready, she's very loud for such a tiny girl!) She loves the seafood ones the most and her coat has gotten super lush and soft since we started giving her the salmon ones! Even the other kitties get jealous when she gets these! They're the perfect little portions for her. She started at 5 pounds and she's getting back up to her 7 pound goal.
--------------------
I have an extremely picky eater and he absolutely loves Sheba Pate. This is the only food he will eat the entire portion. We switched food about a month ago after a bad experience with food from another brand. I love how convenient and easy the portions are packaged,
--------------------
The portions are great for mixing with their dry food and my cats love it. Good on price for a healthier brand.
--------------------
I have only one cat and try to feed him as natural as possible and grain free. It’s no mess, he loves it and I no longer have cat food cans in the fridge.
--------------------
I have 2 cats 1 I have had since she was a kitten and 1 a senior cat I just adopted last month. When I adopted him he needed to be on a few different meds that required wet food to be mixed with it. After they devoured a huge variety pack in little time I decided go and get cans that I could use for more then one serving. My cats would not eat it which made it very difficult to give much needed meds. Will be returning that brand to get more sheba today!
--------------------
My picky elderly cat loves this food! The pate is easy for her to eat, and she loves pretty much every flavor that we tried from Sheba.
--------------------
My 17 year old cat Pretty Girl Precious Loves her Sheba cat food. When I go into the kitchen where her bowl is she'll just sit there scratching on the Sheba box until I pull one out. Then as I'm trying to open it as fast as she wants me to....she'll start spinning in & out of my legs & meowing like she's telling me to hurry up. The way she gets so excited you would think she hasn't been fed for a couple of days. NO this Mama knows at her age she can eat as much as she wants. I'll do whatever it takes to keep her happy at her age. She's given me friendship & love since I rescued her as a wild feral cat.
--------------------
my kitty (10 months old) prefers this brand of all other wet foods. she mostly eats dry food but once a day she gets this treat. she enjoys eating this pate as a soup, so i whip the pate with some water in a soup like consistency and she gobbles up the whole thing right away. she is very lean and a picky eater but loves this food unlike fancy feast and other pates that will remain half eaten.

I adopted a cat about a month ago and have experimented with different brands and so far she loves your brand the most. Her bowl is always licked clean and other brands are left half eaten.
--------------------
My 4 month old kitten has finally found the food of his dreams! He loves the salmon pate. We're customers for life!
--------------------
My cat, the "chosen one", will only eat the fish. He prefers the cuts, but I can't find it in just the fish.
--------------------
There was a discoloration when I open the pack up and after eating my cat vomit it all back up, and he never did that with the can.
--------------------
These are great. The neighbors moved without their car so I have been feeding her. She is not a large cat so the portions are great. Ever once and a while she will want two helpings but no big deal. The large wet canned cat food is too much for her she won't eat it all so it goes to waste.
--------------------
I am having great difficulty finding this selection. It is the only wet food that my cat will eat.
--------------------
MY cats like the food in the cans better than the perfect portions. Have arthritis in my hands and these are difficult to open. Will change to another can food like Fancy Feast when am out of the can supply I have left
--------------------
Bought this for a neighborhood feral cat. Even she won't eat it... and she usually eats everything. I bought it for the convenient smaller portions, but my cat doesn't really like it, so it's back to Fancy Feast.
--------------------
My cat loves Sheba pate and these are convenient and just the right size for 1-2 servings for her.
--------------------
These are horrible! Think this is a "perfect portion"? READ the microscopic feeding guide before you starve your cat to death with these microscopic portions!! The packaging is a nightmare... really hard to pull the thick foil top off without spilling the juices, and then to pull it all the way off so they can be accepted in the recycling pickup. To boot, after this food goes through my cats systems, their poop smells up the whole house. I only purchased these because of an instore deal + gift card deal... NEVER AGAIN.
--------------------
I live less than 2 blocks from Target, but with such a busy lifestyle (and a very often crowded store) I prefer to just order most by items online from Target. They arrive safe and quick every time. Very pleased. If there is ever a problem, they make returns very easy.
--------------------
We tried several different products but couldn't really find the one that our cat fell in love with until she was introduced to SHEBA pate flavors. We are happy we found something she enjoys.
--------------------
Nothing could be better about this item!PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
--------------------
One of the only stores that I could find that sell this. Price was great and free shipping.
