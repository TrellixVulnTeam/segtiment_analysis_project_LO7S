Fresh, organic lemon juice! I drink two teaspoons every morning with I teaspoon sole water(salt) in water for morning detox and it’s great, so healthy! Thanks for keeping this in stock!
Good tasting. Fresh. Convenient. A good staple that I always have on hand.
It has been out for a while, I am hoping it is not gone for good.
Glad you offer this but BRING BACK THE SANTA CRUZ CONCORD GRAPE JUICE PLEASE
Concord grape juice is soooo good for your heart and overall health
Your Wegmans version is white and concord and not as tasty
You used to carry the Santa Cruz organic Concord grape - why did you stop- it was always sold old so people bought it
Now I have to go to Giant to get it!
Fresh, organic juice! I drink two teaspoons of either the Santa Cruz lemon or lime juice every morning with I teaspoon sole water (salt) in water for morning detox and it’s great, so healthy! Thanks for keeping this in stock!
Look no further, this is the BEST price in Cherry Hill, Pennsauken, Cinnaminson, & ALL surrounding areas!
Pros:
•Not syrupy in taste
•Bottled in glass
•Made in USA from US apples
•No additives
•Not from concentrate
•Unique taste

Cons:
•Too expensive at Wegmans, it is $3.99 at Target
•Website states there is a trace of BPA in lid lining
Very fresh, crisp, without the syrupy taste so many apple juices have.
Excellent flavor and from the USA. Yes, it costs more but once you taste it, you see why. To save money, just have a little less and savor it.
We love the fullforce pulp, but too often it's hard to find.
Cannot find in Wegmans Eastway.. Where is it available?
This is hands down the best lemon juice money can buy aside from getting fresh lemons. It is so convenient to have a back-up stored in your freezer. However, Wegmans is very frequently out of stock on this item (50% of the time I want to buy it). Please stock more!!
Usually the amount of pulp is just right...like home squeezed juice.  This had way to much!
