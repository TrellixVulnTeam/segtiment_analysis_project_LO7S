This is a staple of mine and I don’t know what I would do without it. I am always so sad when they’re out!
I usually enjoy Wegman's products just as much or more than the name brands. I unfortunately didn't enjoy this yogurt though and won't be buying it again. It was too thin and watery, didn't even have the Greek yogurt texture.
Thankfully, Wegman's finally opened a store only 20 minutes away from my home.  Previously, I would plan my road trips near a Wegman's, so I could buy a month's (3 qts) supply of the Wegman's Organic Fat Free Greek Yogurt. ps I'm still buying 3 qt. at a time.
Kids love it and I love it too! And they are picky when it comes to yogurt (esp Greek)! I love Wegmans products! Makes organic more affordable and is always delicious! It's the only place I shop!
you have them only at penfield store I shop at pertion fairport store dose not have them why????
This Greek yogurt has a great taste and texture.  Doesn't have that funny after taste of some of the lower calorie yogurts.
